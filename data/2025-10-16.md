### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi is a real-time neural rendering method that supports arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data for autonomous robot testing, addressing cross-sensor inconsistencies and achieving 10-20x faster rendering than ray tracing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods have limitations in rendering speed, support for high-distortion lenses, and handling cross-sensor inconsistencies between cameras and LiDAR, which hinders their use in rigorous autonomous robot testing.

Method: Extends 3DGUT with LiDAR support using automated tiling for spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. Introduces a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy to address cross-sensor inconsistencies.

Result: Reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. Renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based methods. Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art fidelity on autonomous driving datasets.

Conclusion: SimULi enables real-time, high-fidelity simulation of both arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data, making it suitable for rigorous testing of autonomous robots like self-driving vehicles.

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR reframes surgical future prediction as state-change learning using a teacher-student architecture with Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering and Action Dynamics module, achieving consistent improvements across multiple surgical procedures and prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical AI focuses on understanding current events rather than predicting future ones, lacking unified approaches for both short-term and long-term prediction. Existing methods rely on coarse-grained supervision and struggle to generalize across different surgical contexts.

Method: SurgFUTR uses state-change learning through a teacher-student architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering. The teacher learns from current and future clips, while the student predicts future states from current videos alone, guided by an Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module.

Result: Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates the method's generalizability across different surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Reframing surgical future prediction as state-change learning provides a unified approach that spans both short-term and long-term horizons, enabling better generalization across different surgical procedures and contexts.

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMPS is a metric learning framework that improves plant disease diagnosis robustness by using limited target domain samples, achieving significant performance gains over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for plant disease diagnosis often fail to generalize to images from different environments due to domain gaps and limited training data diversity.

Method: Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS) - a metric learning framework that leverages limited labeled samples from target domains to improve model robustness.

Result: TMPS achieved average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points over combined training and fine-tuning methods respectively, and 18.7 and 17.1 point improvements over baseline and conventional metric learning on a dataset of 223,073 leaf images.

Conclusion: TMPS effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in plant disease diagnosis by strategically incorporating limited target domain samples through metric learning, significantly improving diagnostic robustness.

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer enables zero-label learning in image captioning by aligning vision-language representations, allowing VLMs to generate better captions without text labels or full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs rely on labeled datasets, limiting scalability and underutilizing unlabeled image data. ViZer addresses this by enabling zero-label learning.

Method: Active alignment of vision and language representation features during training, without requiring text labels or full retraining of existing VLMs.

Result: Qualitative improvements in caption quality - more grounded and descriptive captions than baseline models, though automated metrics like CIDEr and BERTScore may penalize the added details.

Conclusion: ViZer provides a practical framework for zero-label enhancement in vision-language tasks, demonstrating consistent qualitative improvements across different VLM models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)
*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind is a medical AI system for fetal ultrasound that uses Salient Epistemic Disentanglement to improve report generation and diagnosis, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language models underperform in fetal ultrasound due to challenges like multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity, creating a gap in specialized fetal imaging AI.

Method: Proposed Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED) that injects expert-curated bipartite graph to decouple view-disease associations and uses reinforcement learning for clinically faithful preference selection.

Result: FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines with +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions, while being efficient, stable, and scalable.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap in fetal ultrasound AI by addressing domain-specific challenges through clinical workflow alignment and large-scale dataset curation (FetalSigma-1M).

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5 introduces ZeResFDG, a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL models that combines frequency-decoupled guidance, energy rescaling, and zero-projection to improve image quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control in SD/SDXL models at moderate guidance scales without requiring model retraining.

Method: ZeResFDG module with three components: frequency-decoupled guidance (reweights low/high-frequency components), energy rescaling (matches prediction magnitude), and zero-projection (removes unconditional direction component). Plus QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer for inference-time stabilization.

Result: Improved sharpness, better prompt adherence, enhanced artifact control across SD/SDXL samplers. Also provides natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: CADE 2.5 offers an effective training-free approach to enhance SD/SDXL model performance through advanced guidance techniques and stabilization methods.

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

### [7] [Scope: Selective Cross-modal Orchestration of Visual Perception Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974)
*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a Mixture-of-Encoders framework that dynamically selects specialized vision encoders per image-text pair using instance-level routing, achieving better performance with fewer encoders than naive stacking while reducing computation by 24-49%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models benefit from multiple vision encoders, but naive stacking yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference costs. The goal is to intelligently select encoders rather than using all simultaneously.

Method: SCOPE maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. Training uses dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.

Result: SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49%.

Conclusion: Intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

### [8] [SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016)
*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVAG is a novel task for joint detection, tracking, and temporal localization of objects in videos based on natural language action descriptions. The paper introduces SVAG-Bench benchmark and SVAGFormer baseline model to address this challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video understanding methods focus on either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, but fail to jointly detect and track multiple objects according to their actions with temporal grounding. This gap limits progress in embodied AI, autonomous systems, and human-AI interaction.

Method: Proposed SVAGFormer framework that adapts state-of-the-art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding. Created SVAG-Bench with 688 videos, 19,590 annotations, and 903 unique verbs covering diverse objects, actions, and scenes.

Result: Empirical results show existing models perform poorly on SVAG, especially in dense or complex scenes. This highlights the need for better reasoning about fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Conclusion: SVAG presents a challenging new task that requires advanced reasoning capabilities. The poor performance of current models indicates significant room for improvement in understanding fine-grained actions and their spatio-temporal grounding in videos.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

### [9] [SeqBench: Benchmarking Sequential Narrative Generation in Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13042)
*Zhengxu Tang,Zizheng Wang,Luning Wang,Zitao Shuai,Chenhao Zhang,Siyu Qian,Yirui Wu,Bohao Wang,Haosong Rao,Zhenyu Yang,Chenwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqBench is a new benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in text-to-video generation, addressing limitations in current models' ability to create logically progressing multi-event narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with generating coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through multiple events, and existing benchmarks focus mainly on visual quality rather than narrative coherence over extended sequences.

Method: Created SeqBench with 320 carefully designed prompts spanning various narrative complexities, using 2,560 human-annotated videos from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models. Also developed a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic evaluation metric to capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering efficiently.

Result: The DTG-based metric shows strong correlation with human annotations. Evaluation reveals critical limitations: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and difficulties preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions.

Conclusion: SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

*Jungbin Cho,Minsu Kim,Jisoo Kim,Ce Zheng,Laszlo A. Jeni,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Youngjae Yu,Seonjoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt is a framework that injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models by leveraging disjoint datasets through two adaptation stages: motion inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, but human motion is both diverse/semantically rich and shaped by surrounding scenes. Constructing large-scale datasets with both text-motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging.

Method: Two-stage adaptation: 1) Motion inbetweening with keyframing layers that modulate motion latents while preserving latent manifold, 2) Scene-aware inbetweening with scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry through cross-attention by adaptively querying local context.

Result: Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges disjoint datasets to inject scene-awareness, and further analysis reveals the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

*Huawei Jiang,Husna Mutahira,Gan Huang,Mannan Saeed Muhammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid 1D CNN-Mamba model for ECG classification achieves superior performance on PhysioNet challenges, outperforming previous methods in detecting cardiac abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models like residual networks and transformers have limited performance with long ECG sequences. State space models offer an efficient alternative for processing sequential medical signals.

Method: Proposed 1D CNN Electrocardiogram Mamba - a hybrid framework combining convolutional feature extraction with Mamba (selective state space model) using Vision Mamba's bidirectional variant to enhance temporal dependency representation in ECG data.

Result: Achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC scores than best previously published algorithms on twelve-lead ECGs in PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges 2020 and 2021.

Conclusion: Mamba-based architectures show strong potential for advancing reliable ECG classification, supporting early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and enhancing accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor is the first geometry-free self-supervised model for novel view synthesis that achieves transferable pose representations without 3D inductive biases, outperforming prior pose-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior self-supervised NVS models lack transferability - their predicted poses don't generalize across different scenes, indicating they're not truly learning camera pose.

Method: Combines pair-wise pose estimation with input/output augmentation to disentangle camera pose from scene content, using unconstrained latent pose variables without 3D geometric biases.

Result: XFactor achieves true transferability where poses extracted from one video can re-render camera trajectories in other scenes, significantly outperforming prior pose-free NVS transformers.

Conclusion: Geometry-free self-supervised NVS with transferable pose representations is possible, and latent poses correlate well with real-world camera poses despite no explicit SE(3) parameterization.

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

### [13] [Direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared and visible image fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13067)
*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared and visible image fusion that preserves directional information across scales to improve edge fidelity and texture preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods collapse gradients to magnitude, removing directional information and yielding ambiguous supervision with suboptimal edge fidelity in image fusion tasks.

Method: Introduces a direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and vertical components separately while preserving their sign across different scales.

Result: Experiments show the approach promotes sharper, better-aligned edges and richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed direction-aware gradient loss provides clear directional guidance and improves infrared and visible image fusion performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation struggle with domain shifts across different datasets, particularly variations in image appearance (style) and population-dependent anatomical characteristics (content) in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation.

Method: Combines efficient style harmonization through z-normalization with bidirectional deformable image registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with segmentation and discriminator networks to guide registration with respect to region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations aligning source images to target domain.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across all experiments. Achieves up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical dementia patients, with largest gains in scenarios with substantial content shift.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates efficacy for accurate hippocampus segmentation across diverse populations, effectively addressing domain shifts encountered in cross-domain MRI hippocampus segmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

### [15] [Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13080)
*Shuai Fu,Jian Zhou,Qi Chen,Huang Jing,Huy Anh Nguyen,Xiaohan Liu,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma,Quanshi Zhang,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic framework for quantifying counting hallucinations in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), where models generate incorrect numbers of objects despite training data patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPMs often produce hallucinated samples that conflict with real-world knowledge, but there's a lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations, hindering progress in addressing this challenge.

Method: Constructed CountHalluSet dataset suite with well-defined counting criteria (ToyShape, SimObject, RealHand), developed standardized evaluation protocol, and systematically examined how different sampling conditions affect counting hallucination levels.

Result: Systematic analysis revealed that common evaluation metrics like FID fail to capture counting hallucinations consistently, and different sampling conditions significantly affect hallucination levels.

Conclusion: This work takes the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offers new insights for investigating hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest is a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method that uses spatio-temporal feature memory to reduce computational overhead while maintaining temporal consistency and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods suffer from high computational overhead, memory consumption, and visual artifacts like temporal inconsistencies, blurring, and mosaic patterns.

Method: Uses Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory (SFM) to cache features from previous frames, Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) for temporal consistency, and cross-attention maps for automatic mask extraction to preserve background integrity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, with reduced computational overhead and improved temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest provides a superior and practical solution for text-driven video editing with enhanced efficiency and visual quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoSocial dataset and EgoSoD method address AI's lack of social awareness in AR/VR by detecting optimal intervention timing in social interactions using multimodal cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack social awareness for AR/VR applications, leading to constant, disruptive responses that negatively impact user focus and natural conversation flow.

Method: Created EgoSocial dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, and developed EgoSoD - an end-to-end method that integrates multimodal contextual cues into a social thinking graph to dynamically model participants and interactions.

Result: OLLMs struggle with intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing, and improves Phi-4 by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.

Conclusion: The proposed EgoSocial dataset and EgoSoD method significantly enhance AI's ability to detect social dynamics and determine appropriate intervention timing in egocentric AR/VR scenarios.

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveCritic is a new framework for evaluating autonomous driving planners that uses a curated dataset of challenging scenarios and a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model to better align with human judgment through context-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like EPDMS lack context awareness in nuanced driving scenarios, making it difficult to properly evaluate autonomous driving planners according to human judgment standards.

Method: Two key contributions: 1) DriveCritic dataset with challenging scenarios annotated with pairwise human preferences, and 2) DriveCritic model - a VLM fine-tuned using two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning to evaluate trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.

Result: DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness capabilities.

Conclusion: DriveCritic provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation for evaluating autonomous driving systems by addressing the context awareness limitations of current evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

*Zicong Zhou,Baihan Zhao,Andreas Mang,Guojun Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPreg is a novel diffeomorphic image registration method that ensures positive Jacobian determinants and provides accurate inverse transformations within the group of diffeomorphisms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in brain scan registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve registration accuracy while controlling transformation quality, ensuring diffeomorphic properties essential for neuroimaging workflows, and providing accurate inverse transformations that conventional methods lack.

Method: Uses a Variational Principle (VP) grid generation approach to construct non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl, generating diffeomorphic spatial transformations within the group of diffeomorphisms rather than image space.

Result: VPreg outperforms ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt in 150 brain scan registrations from OASIS-1 dataset, achieving better Dice scores for 35 regions of interest, superior transformation regularity, and more accurate and consistent inverse maps.

Conclusion: VPreg provides a superior diffeomorphic registration framework that guarantees transformation quality, positive Jacobian determinants, and accurate inverse computations, making it particularly valuable for computational anatomy and neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

*Rongjun Chen,Chengsi Yao,Jinchang Ren,Xianxian Zeng,Peixian Wang,Jun Yuan,Jiawen Li,Huimin Zhao,Xu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OS-HGAdapter, which uses LLM semantic knowledge to bridge the entropy gap between text and images for better cross-modal alignment, achieving significant retrieval improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the imbalance in cross-modal retrieval caused by different information entropy between text and images, aiming to reproduce human-like alignment capabilities.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) LLM-enhanced text polysemy description to increase text modality entropy, 2) Hypergraph adapter for multilateral text-image connections to correct matching errors and reduce semantic noise.

Result: Achieved 16.8% text-to-image and 40.1% image-to-text retrieval gains on Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed OS-HGAdapter effectively bridges the entropy gap between modalities using LLM semantic knowledge and hypergraph adaptation, significantly improving cross-modal retrieval performance.

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed DP-TTA method for TEM signal denoising that uses dictionary-driven prior regularization to enable test-time adaptation across different geographical regions, overcoming performance degradation when models trained in one environment are applied to new settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning TEM denoising models trained on simulated or single real-world data fail in new geographical regions due to differences in noise characteristics, geological conditions, equipment, and external interference.

Method: Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA) that encodes TEM signals' intrinsic physical characteristics (exponential decay, smoothness) as dictionary-driven prior, integrated into DTEMDNet network. During testing, minimizes self-supervised losses from dictionary-driven consistency and signal one-order variation for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves significantly better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DP-TTA framework effectively leverages TEM signals' intrinsic physical characteristics as prior knowledge to enable robust test-time adaptation across different geographical environments, overcoming domain shift issues in TEM denoising applications.

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

*Zhen Li,Xibin Jin,Guoliang Li,Shuai Wang,Miaowen Wen,Huseyin Arslan,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Chengzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS) for scene reconstruction requires maximizing GS quality rather than traditional metrics. The paper proposes STT-GS strategy with feature-domain clustering and joint client selection/power control to prioritize valuable clients while minimizing pilot overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional edge resource management methods focus on communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, which are inapplicable for EGS that explicitly aims to maximize Gaussian splatting qualities. There's a need for GS-oriented optimization that accounts for heterogeneous view contributions from different clients.

Method: Proposes STT-GS strategy: 1) Sample subset of images as pilot data using feature-domain clustering for representative selection; 2) Pilot transmission time minimization to reduce overhead; 3) Joint client selection and power control framework using penalty alternating majorization minimization algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem.

Result: The proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g., 10%), achieving excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.

Conclusion: The STT-GS strategy effectively addresses the causality dilemma in EGS by enabling efficient pilot sampling and resource allocation, providing a practical solution for quality-oriented edge Gaussian splatting systems.

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based occupancy prediction methods focus on structural modifications but underutilize the rich diversity of features in 2D images. The paper aims to explore representation fusion to better leverage these features.

Method: Two-stage framework that extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from input images, uses deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these features, and incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM (Segment Anything Model) to enhance accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark without increasing training costs.

Conclusion: The proposed CIGOcc framework demonstrates that effective multi-level representation fusion can significantly improve occupancy prediction performance by better utilizing diverse 2D image features.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and

Conclusion: Paper Copilot resources help the community track changes, diagnose failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust, transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Motivation: Current methods oversimplify stylistic diversity or ignore regional motion style differences (upper vs. lower body), and overlook the need for motion style to dynamically adapt to speech rhythm and emotion changes, limiting motion realism.

Method: Proposes MimicParts framework with part-aware style injection and part-aware denoising network that divides body into regions to encode localized motion styles, and uses part-aware attention block to allow rhythm and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms existing methods in generating natural and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Conclusion: MimicParts successfully addresses limitations of current approaches by capturing fine-grained regional motion style differences and dynamically adapting to speech rhythm and emotion variations, resulting in more realistic stylized motion generation.

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Conclusion: The survey establishes a clear conceptual framework for prompt-based adaptation, provides systematic taxonomy, and identifies future research directions to guide researchers and practitioners in exploring the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

### [29] [Sample-Centric Multi-Task Learning for Detection and Segmentation of Industrial Surface Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13226)
*Hang-Cheng Dong,Yibo Jiao,Fupeng Wei,Guodong Liu,Dong Ye,Bingguo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sample-centric multi-task learning framework for industrial surface defect inspection that jointly learns sample-level classification and pixel-level localization to address issues with sparse, small, and low-contrast defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models achieve strong pixel-overlap metrics but exhibit insufficient stability at sample level due to mismatch between optimization objective and QC decision granularity, especially for sparse or slender defects.

Method: Sample-centric multi-task learning framework with shared-encoder architecture that jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask localization, with sample-level supervision modulating feature distribution and boosting recall.

Result: Substantially improves reliability of sample-level decisions and completeness of defect localization on two benchmark datasets, with proposed decision-linked metrics showing better performance.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-centric approach effectively addresses the limitations of pixel-centric methods in industrial defect inspection by better aligning optimization with QC decision requirements.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

*Emily Miller,Michael Milford,Muhammad Burhan Hafez,SD Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes three training-free uncertainty metrics (Similarity Distribution, Ratio Spread, and Statistical Uncertainty) for Visual Place Recognition that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing statistical patterns in similarity scores, enabling robust place matching across varying environmental conditions without additional training or computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR systems face challenges with varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints. Failure-critical applications like SLAM loop closure detection require robust uncertainty estimation for place matching to ensure reliability.

Method: Three training-free uncertainty metrics: Similarity Distribution (SD) measures score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; Statistical Uncertainty (SU) combines SD and RS as a unified metric. All operate without additional training, architectural changes, or geometric verification.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets shows the metrics excel at discriminating correct/incorrect matches, consistently outperform existing approaches, maintain negligible computational overhead, and improve precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free uncertainty metrics provide robust confidence estimation for VPR systems, enabling real-time deployment in varied environmental conditions with improved reliability and minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses VLMs' affirmative bias in negation understanding by introducing CoVAND dataset and NegToMe module, which improves negation detection performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art vision-language models suffer from critical failures in understanding negation, particularly in described object detection tasks, due to affirmative bias.

Method: Proposes CoVAND dataset with chain-of-thought pipeline for negation data, and NegToMe module that merges negation tokens with attributes to preserve semantic meaning during tokenization, combined with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves performance on negation benchmarks, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval and lowering false positive rate, with generalization to state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: This work marks a crucial step forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection applications by tackling the architectural causes of affirmative bias.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares GPU vs FPGA acceleration for feature detection in Visual SLAM, finding GPUs better for traditional detectors (FAST, Harris) but FPGAs superior for learning-based detectors (SuperPoint) in both performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature detection is a time-consuming module in SLAM systems deployed on power-constrained platforms like drones. While GPUs are commonly used for acceleration, modern SoCs with integrated FPGAs offer alternative acceleration options that need comparative evaluation.

Method: Comparative study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors in a Visual SLAM pipeline, evaluating GPU-accelerated vs FPGA-accelerated implementations of FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint detectors on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).

Result: For non-learning-based detectors (FAST, Harris), GPU implementations achieve better runtime performance and energy efficiency. For learning-based detector (SuperPoint), FPGA implementation achieves up to 3.1× runtime and 1.4× energy efficiency improvements over GPU. FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM achieves comparable performance to GPU-accelerated V-SLAM with better FPS in 2 out of 5 sequences, though GPU version is generally more accurate.

Conclusion: Hardware acceleration choice depends on detector type: GPUs are better for traditional detectors while FPGAs excel for learning-based detectors. Hardware acceleration enables less frequent bundle adjustment without sacrificing accuracy, improving overall V-SLAM pipeline performance.

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVector is a unified framework that extracts multiple vector types (polygons, polylines, line segments) from raster images using a single model, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require separate models for different vector structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector extraction methods are tailored to single vector types, requiring separate models for different structures and limiting the ability to capture complex structures due to independent treatment of instance and geometric attributes.

Method: UniVector encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and geometry-level information, iteratively updates them through an interaction module for cross-level context exchange, and applies a dynamic shape constraint to refine global structures and key points.

Result: UniVector sets a new state of the art on both single- and multi-structure vector extraction tasks, as demonstrated through experiments on the introduced Multi-Vector dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed UniVector framework successfully unifies multiple vector type extraction within a single model by leveraging instance-geometry interaction, achieving superior performance across diverse vector structures.

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

*Yukuan Zhang,Jiarui Zhao,Shangqing Nie,Jin Kuang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIPTrack is a multimodal vision-language tracking framework that uses explicit and implicit prompts to dynamically model targets and achieve semantic alignment, outperforming existing trackers on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal tracking methods use static textual descriptions from LLMs that lack adaptability to real-time target changes and are prone to hallucinations, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The framework uses explicit prompts that convert spatial motion information into natural language for spatiotemporal guidance, and implicit prompts that combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to capture appearance attributes. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted via CLIP text encoder. A Discriminative Feature Augmentor enhances visual and cross-modal representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, showing robust adaptability and superior performance.

Conclusion: EPIPTrack effectively addresses the limitations of static textual descriptions by introducing dynamic multimodal prompts that adapt to target state changes, achieving state-of-the-art tracking performance across various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A super real-time crowd counting model with stem-encoder-decoder structure that achieves fastest inference speeds (381.7 FPS on GTX 1080Ti, 71.9 FPS on Jetson TX1) while maintaining competitive accuracy for embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd counting methods have excessive parameters and complex calculations that make them unsuitable for real-time embedded applications in intelligent security, urban planning, and public safety management.

Method: Uses stem network with large convolution kernels for better receptive field, encoder with conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion for multi-scale feature merging with low computation, and feature pyramid networks to address incomplete fusion issues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art inference speed while maintaining competitive accuracy on three benchmarks, demonstrating suitability for embedded systems with 381.7 FPS on GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on Jetson TX1.

Conclusion: The proposed network successfully addresses the real-time requirements for crowd counting on embedded systems, providing the fastest inference speed while ensuring practical accuracy for applications in security and public safety.

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

*Haochuan Xu,Yun Sing Koh,Shuhuai Huang,Zirun Zhou,Di Wang,Jun Sakuma,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes EDPA, a model-agnostic adversarial patch attack for Vision-Language-Action models that disrupts semantic alignment between visual and text representations, and introduces a defense strategy through adversarial fine-tuning of the visual encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models have achieved significant progress in robot learning, but their adversarial robustness remains underexplored, creating security vulnerabilities in robotic systems.

Method: The Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA) generates adversarial patches that disrupt semantic alignment between visual and textual representations and maximize discrepancy between clean and adversarial latent representations. A defense strategy involves adversarial fine-tuning of the visual encoder to produce similar representations for clean and perturbed inputs.

Result: Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark show that EDPA substantially increases task failure rates of state-of-the-art VLA models, while the proposed defense effectively mitigates this performance degradation.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates both the vulnerability of VLA models to adversarial patch attacks and the effectiveness of adversarial fine-tuning as a defense strategy, highlighting the importance of robustness in vision-language-action systems for robotics.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free decoding strategy that reduces hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by using self-augmentation prompting for query-dependent visual alignment and adaptive thresholding for entropy-aware decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs inherit hallucination tendencies from language models, and existing visual contrastive decoding methods use generic augmentations that ignore text query context, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Two key components: 1) Self-augmentation prompting that uses model's intrinsic knowledge to align semantics between query and visual augmentation, 2) Adaptive thresholding algorithm that adjusts next token candidate size based on output sparsity using full logit distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks show significant improvement in factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods.

Conclusion: Integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding is crucial for improving effective generation in LVLMs and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how prompt design affects zero-shot classification of visually similar categories like human postures, particularly in data-scarce conditions where VLMs are promising but prompt influence is not well understood.

Method: Evaluated modern VLMs (OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2, SigLip) on a 285-image COCO-derived dataset using three-tiered prompt design that systematically increases linguistic detail for classifying sitting, standing, and walking/running postures.

Result: Highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and OpenCLIP) achieved best results with simplest prompts (68.8% accuracy), while adding descriptive detail significantly degraded performance (down to 55.1%). Lower-performing SigLip model improved with more descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Conclusion: Simple prompts are most effective for high-performing VLMs in zero-shot classification of similar categories, while detailed prompts can cause 'prompt overfitting'. Model performance level determines optimal prompt specificity strategy.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

*Tiancheng Gu,Kaicheng Yang,Kaichen Zhang,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Yueyi Zhang,Weidong Cai,Jiankang Deng,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniME-V2 is a universal multimodal embedding model that uses MLLMs to generate semantic matching scores for hard negative mining and soft label alignment, achieving SOTA performance on MMEB benchmark and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal embedding models struggle with capturing subtle semantic differences, lack diversity in negative samples, and have limited discriminative ability for false/hard negatives.

Method: 1) Construct potential hard negative set via global retrieval; 2) Use MLLM-as-a-Judge to assess semantic alignment and generate soft matching scores; 3) Use scores for hard negative mining and as soft labels; 4) Align similarity matrix with semantic matching scores; 5) Propose UniME-V2-Reranker with joint pairwise and listwise optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks in MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances representation learning by leveraging MLLMs for semantic understanding, improves discriminative capacity through soft label alignment, and demonstrates superior performance through comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

*Minji Kim,Taekyung Kim,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the internal information flow of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) using mechanistic interpretability, revealing consistent patterns in temporal reasoning and video-language integration across VideoQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in VideoLLMs, their internal mechanisms for extracting and propagating video and textual information remain poorly understood, limiting interpretability and generalization.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability techniques to analyze the internal information flow of VideoLLMs, examining cross-frame interactions and video-language integration patterns across different layers.

Result: Revealed four key patterns: (1) early-to-middle layers handle cross-frame interactions for temporal reasoning, (2) middle layers facilitate video-language integration via alignment with temporal concepts, (3) middle-to-late layers generate answers, and (4) models can maintain performance while pruning 58% of attention edges.

Conclusion: The findings provide a blueprint for how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

*David Freire-Obregón,José Salas-Cáceres,Javier Lorenzo-Navarro,Oliverio J. Santana,Daniel Hernández-Sosa,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a streaming benchmark to study how cultural variation and image blurring affect facial expression recognition robustness, revealing asymmetric degradation patterns between cultural groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FER evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery, but real-world applications must handle both cultural diversity and degraded visual conditions.

Method: Agent-based streaming benchmark with frozen CLIP features and lightweight residual adapters, testing monocultural/mixed populations on a 5x5 lattice with sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur.

Result: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but drop sharply at intermediate stages, while KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations show intermediate patterns with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation.

Conclusion: Cultural composition and interaction structure significantly influence FER robustness under deteriorating perceptual conditions, with imbalanced settings amplifying majority-group weaknesses.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

TL;DR: MDM is a unified multi-modal architecture that uses a Mamba-based diffusion model with a shared variational autoencoder for encoding and decoding across modalities, achieving superior performance in high-dimensional data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end multi-modal models use separate encoders and decoders for different modalities, which hinders joint representation learning and unified multi-modal processing.

Method: Proposes MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba) using a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model with a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding across modalities.

Result: MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, Chameleon) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral in image generation, captioning, VQA, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MDM effectively unifies multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

### [45] [CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13669)
*Zian Li,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanvasMAR is a video masked autoregressive model that introduces a canvas mechanism to address slow-start problems and error accumulation in video generation, achieving high-quality results with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video masked autoregressive models suffer from slow-start problems due to lack of global structure early in sampling and error accumulation across spatial and temporal dimensions during autoregression.

Method: Introduces a canvas mechanism - a blurred global prediction of the next frame as starting point for masked generation, compositional classifier-free guidance for joint spatial and temporal conditioning, and noise-based canvas augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves high-quality video generation with fewer autoregressive steps, shows remarkable performance on Kinetics-600 among autoregressive models, and rivals diffusion-based methods on BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks.

Conclusion: CanvasMAR effectively mitigates key limitations of video MAR models through the canvas mechanism and related innovations, enabling faster and more coherent video synthesis while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLongCite is a new benchmark that evaluates large vision language models' faithfulness in long-context scenarios across multiple modalities, revealing their limitations despite extended context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of long-context faithfulness focus mainly on text-only domains, while multimodal assessments are limited to short contexts, creating a gap in understanding how LVLMs handle long multimodal contexts.

Method: Created MMLongCite benchmark with 8 distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals, incorporating diverse modalities including text, images, and videos to systematically evaluate LVLM faithfulness.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed limited faithfulness in handling long multimodal contexts, with performance affected by context length and position of crucial content.

Conclusion: Extended context windows alone don't guarantee effective context utilization in multimodal scenarios, highlighting the need for improved long-context faithfulness in LVLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Sooyeon Go,Jin-Hwa Kim,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVCustom is a diffusion-based framework that achieves both multi-view camera pose control and prompt-based customization with geometric consistency, addressing limitations in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view generation models lack customization with geometric consistency, while customization models lack explicit viewpoint control. The paper introduces multi-view customization as a novel task to unify both capabilities.

Method: MVCustom uses a feature-field representation to learn subject identity and geometry, enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention for multi-view consistency. It introduces depth-aware feature rendering and consistent-aware latent completion for geometric consistency and perspective alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.

Conclusion: MVCustom successfully bridges the gap between multi-view generation and customization, providing a unified solution for controllable generative models with both camera pose control and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

### [48] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskDCPT is a novel pre-training method that uses masked degradation classification and image reconstruction to learn generalized representations for universal image restoration tasks, achieving significant performance improvements across various degradation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pre-training methods lack comprehensive degradation understanding for image restoration. The authors aim to develop a method that can classify degradation types while learning robust representations suitable for universal restoration tasks.

Method: MaskDCPT uses an encoder with two decoders: one for degradation type classification and another for high-quality image reconstruction. It combines masked image modeling with contrastive learning, using degradation type as weak supervision.

Result: MaskDCPT improves PSNR by at least 3.77 dB in all-in-one restoration and reduces PIQE by 34.8% in real-world scenarios. It shows strong generalization to unseen degradation types and works well for both CNNs and Transformers.

Conclusion: MaskDCPT provides an effective pre-training approach for universal image restoration, demonstrating superior performance and generalization. The authors also release UIR-2.5M dataset with 2.5M samples across 19 degradation types and 200+ levels.

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogViG is a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that uses Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance vision graph neural networks by limiting long-range links and incorporating multi-scale high-resolution branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph construction methods like KNN are expensive for larger images, and fixed step scales in methods like SVGA can cause over-squashing and miss important long-range connections that could provide valuable information.

Method: Proposed Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to limit long-range links, and created LogViG - a hybrid CNN-GNN model with multi-scale high-resolution branches that fuse features between high-resolution and low-resolution branches.

Result: LogViG outperforms existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation. Ti-LogViG achieves 79.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 1.7% higher than Vision GNN with 24.3% parameter reduction and 35.3% GMACs reduction.

Conclusion: Leveraging long-range links through LSGC in vision graph neural networks can exceed current state-of-the-art ViG performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed logarithmic scalable graph construction approach.

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

*Junhong Shen,Mu Cai,Bo Hu,Ameet Talwalkar,David A Ross,Cordelia Schmid,Alireza Fathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE is an agentic framework that uses derendering (reverse-engineering visuals into executable code) to enable verifiable visual reasoning in MLLMs, significantly improving performance on visual reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams because pixel-based perception lacks verification mechanisms, leading to ambiguous results.

Method: RECODE generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce input images, uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction, and iteratively refines the code to transform perceptual tasks into verifiable symbolic problems.

Result: RECODE significantly outperforms methods that don't use code or only use code for auxiliary purposes on benchmarks like CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K.

Conclusion: Grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning, demonstrating the value of derendering as a modality for visual understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for 3D Novel Class Discovery in point cloud segmentation using causal representation learning and reasoning to transfer knowledge from labeled base classes to unlabeled novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Novel Class Discovery in 3D point clouds often rely on coarse statistical correlations, which can lead to confusion in novel class inference. The authors aim to establish stronger, more accurate correlations between point representations and class labels using causal relationships.

Method: The method introduces a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to formalize the 3D-NCD problem and proposes Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. It involves: 1) analyzing hidden confounders in base class representations, 2) developing causal representation prototypes that eliminate confounders, and 3) using graph structures to model causal relationships between base and novel class prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments and visualization results on both 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: By imposing causal relationships as strong constraints and using structural causal modeling, the method successfully uncovers essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond to classes, enabling effective knowledge transfer from base to novel classes in 3D segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images for adapting deep learning architectures, and to build foundation models for fMRI data through open science.

Method: Transform 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps, then train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI data using spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework.

Result: Masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. The model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects and subject-specific trait decoding across brain state changes.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges the fMRI-natural image modality gap and demonstrates the potential of foundation models for fMRI data, with ongoing open science development.

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents InstantSfM, a GPU-accelerated Structure-from-Motion method that achieves up to 40x speedup over COLMAP while maintaining comparable or improved reconstruction accuracy, especially on large-scale datasets with thousands of images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SfM methods like COLMAP suffer from computational overhead in large-scale scenarios due to CPU-specialized implementations, while deep learning approaches like VGGSfM and VGGT face GPU memory limitations when scaling to thousands of images.

Method: The authors leverage GPU parallel computation to accelerate all critical stages of the SfM pipeline, extending sparse-aware bundle adjustment techniques to both bundle adjustment and global positioning within a unified global SfM framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show up to 40x speedup over COLMAP while achieving comparable or improved reconstruction accuracy, successfully handling datasets with 5000+ images where competing methods run out of memory.

Conclusion: The proposed InstantSfM method effectively addresses the accuracy-speed trade-off in traditional SfM and the scalability limitations of deep learning approaches, demonstrating superior performance on large-scale reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

*Yi Zhang,Bolin Ni,Xin-Sheng Chen,Heng-Rui Zhang,Yongming Rao,Houwen Peng,Qinglin Lu,Han Hu,Meng-Hao Guo,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Honey-Data-15M, a 15M QA pair dataset with enhanced cleaning and dual-level Chain-of-Thought reasoning, along with HoneyPipe data curation pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art performance with their Bee-8B model that competes with semi-open models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully open multimodal large language models lag behind proprietary counterparts due to poor data quality in existing open-source datasets, particularly lacking complex reasoning data and suffering from widespread noise.

Method: Developed Honey-Data-15M dataset with 15M QA pairs using multiple cleaning techniques and dual-level CoT enrichment, created HoneyPipe data curation pipeline with DataStudio framework, and trained Bee-8B model on this dataset.

Result: Bee-8B establishes new SOTA for fully open MLLMs, achieving competitive performance that sometimes surpasses recent semi-open models like InternVL3.5-8B.

Conclusion: Principled focus on data quality is key to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with semi-open counterparts, demonstrated through comprehensive resource suite including dataset, pipeline, and model weights.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

*Fitim Abdullahu,Helmut Grabner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o shows partial alignment with human assessments of visual interestingness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and enabling effective labeling of image pairs for training learning-to-rank models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) capture visual interestingness concepts and examine alignment between human assessments and AI predictions, given that attention and interestingness are crucial in daily life.

Method: Comparative analysis between human assessments and GPT-4o's predictions of visual interestingness, using the aligned results to label image pairs for training a learning-to-rank model through knowledge distillation.

Result: Partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o was found, with GPT-4o capturing the concept of visual interestingness better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The findings enable effective labeling of image pairs for training and pave the way for deeper understanding of human interest through LMM capabilities.

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Universal Verifier, a novel plugin for multimodal reasoning that enables reflection and refinement on visual outcomes. It presents ViVerBench benchmark showing VLMs' performance gap, trains OmniVerifier-7B for universal visual verification, and proposes OmniVerifier-TTS for test-time scaling that improves generation and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models consistently underperform in reliable visual verification tasks, showing a substantial gap from human-level capability. There is a need for fundamental reflection and refinement capabilities during multimodal reasoning and generation processes.

Method: Three main approaches: (1) Built ViVerBench benchmark with 16 categories of visual verification tasks; (2) Designed automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and trained OmniVerifier-7B; (3) Proposed OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm for iterative fine-grained optimization.

Result: OmniVerifier-7B achieves notable gains on ViVerBench (+8.3). OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench (+3.7) and GenEval++ (+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N. The approach demonstrates synergistic interaction of three atomic capabilities in visual verification.

Conclusion: Generative Universal Verifier advances reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking progress toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems by endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training strategy that allows removing cost volumes from optical flow estimators after sufficient training, leading to faster inference and lower memory usage while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cost volumes are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting processing speed and input resolution in optical flow estimation. Empirical observation showed that cost volumes become less important once other network components are sufficiently trained.

Method: A training strategy that enables removal of cost volumes from optical flow estimators throughout training, creating three models with different compute budgets based on this approach.

Result: The most accurate model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being 1.2× faster with 6× lower memory footprint than comparable models. The fastest model can process Full HD frames at 20 FPS using only 500 MB GPU memory.

Conclusion: The proposed training strategy successfully eliminates the need for cost volumes in optical flow estimation, significantly improving inference speed and reducing memory requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

*Divya Bhardwaj,Arnav Ramamoorthy,Poonam Goyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DEF-YOLO, a YOLO-based architecture with deformable convolutions for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery, and introduces the first large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon (TICW) dataset to address the lack of benchmark data in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a real-time, 24x7 surveillance solution that is low-cost and privacy-preserved for concealed weapon detection, addressing limitations of other imaging modalities like poor resolution in microwave imaging and privacy concerns in millimeter wave imaging.

Method: Enhanced YOLOv8 architecture with deformable convolutions at SPPF layer and backbone/neck layers to extract multi-scale features, enabling adaptive focus on localization in thermal homogeneous regions. Also incorporates focal loss to handle class imbalance and introduces the TICW dataset.

Result: The proposed DEF-YOLO establishes a new benchmark for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery through extensive experimentation, achieving effective detection while maintaining speed and throughput.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel approach and dataset that effectively addresses the challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision, providing a practical solution for real-time surveillance applications.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group-VQ improves VQ-VAEs by using group-wise codebook optimization to address codebook collapse issues and enhance reconstruction quality, while also enabling post-training codebook size adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAEs suffer from codebook collapse problems, and existing solutions using static codebooks or joint optimization limit learning capability and reduce reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes Group-VQ with group-wise codebook optimization where each group is optimized independently with joint optimization within groups, plus a training-free codebook resampling method for post-training size adjustment.

Result: Improved reconstruction performance in image experiments across various settings, and successful flexible adjustment of codebook size through post-training sampling.

Conclusion: Group-VQ provides better trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance while enabling flexible codebook size adjustment after training.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

*Sipeng Yang,Jiayu Ji,Qingchuan Zhu,Zhiyao Yang,Xiaogang Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a new no-reference video quality assessment metric specifically designed for rendered videos, along with a large dataset of rendered videos with subjective quality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-VQA methods are biased for rendered videos because they focus on camera-captured content and don't properly handle temporal artifacts common in rendered videos.

Method: Created a large rendering-oriented video dataset with diverse 3D scenes and rendering settings, then calibrated a NR-VQA metric that assesses both image quality and temporal stability.

Result: The proposed metric outperforms existing NR-VQA metrics on rendered videos and can effectively benchmark supersampling methods and frame generation strategies.

Conclusion: The work provides a specialized solution for quality assessment of rendered videos, addressing the limitations of existing methods and enabling better evaluation of real-time rendering applications.

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

TL;DR: DepthVLA is a Vision-Language-Action model that enhances spatial reasoning by incorporating a pretrained depth prediction module, achieving superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from limited spatial reasoning capabilities inherited from VLMs, requiring extensive action-data pretraining that reduces training efficiency and still provides insufficient spatial understanding.

Method: DepthVLA uses a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, incorporating explicit spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module.

Result: DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in Simpler simulator.

Conclusion: The proposed DepthVLA architecture effectively enhances spatial reasoning in VLA models through explicit depth prediction, achieving significant performance improvements in both real-world and simulated robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method that combines Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring LiDAR data or ground-truth 3D motion annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing 3DGS methods that require camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations, and motion data for dynamic urban scene modeling.

Method: Integrates SDFs with 3DGS using 2D object-agnostic priors (depth and point tracking) and a unified optimization framework that enhances geometric accuracy and deformation modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rendering metrics without LiDAR data, and further improves with LiDAR integration. Enables scene editing tasks like decomposition and composition.

Conclusion: The proposed SDF-3DGS integration provides a more robust and adaptable representation for dynamic scenes, reducing dependency on extensive ground-truth data while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLSDA is a novel WiFi-based gesture recognition framework that uses large foundation models to improve generalization and semantic understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing model size and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WiFi gesture recognition methods suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to domain-sensitive CSI data and lack of high-level gesture abstraction.

Method: Uses dual-path CSI encoding (CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms), Multiscale Semantic Encoder with cross-modal attention, Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision for inter-class correlations, and Robust Dual-Distillation to compress the model.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition on Widar3.0 benchmark, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: GLSDA provides a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for assessing intrinsic-dynamic spatial reasoning, which is crucial for real-world applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous navigation but represents a fundamental gap in current VLM evaluation.

Method: Proposed a unified benchmark based on cognitive taxonomy with four quadrants (Intrinsic-Static, Intrinsic-Dynamic, Extrinsic-Static, Extrinsic-Dynamic), developed automated pipeline to generate diverse spatial reasoning questions, creating Spatial-DISE dataset with 559 evaluation and 12K+ training VQA pairs.

Result: Evaluation of 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals large and consistent gaps to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning, with current models struggling significantly with dynamic spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE provides a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward achieving human-like spatial intelligence in VLMs, highlighting the need for improved spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be

Motivation: Most RL approaches for text-to-image generation focus on diffusion or autoregressive models, overlooking masked generative models which represent an important alternative paradigm.

Method: Proposes Mask-GRPO incorporating Group Relative Policy Optimization into masked generative models by redefining transition probability, formulating unmasking as multi-step decision making, and using strategies like removing KL constraint, applying reduction strategy, and filtering low-quality samples.

Result: Substantially improves base model Show-o on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO successfully demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of applying RL to masked generative models for text-to-image generation, filling an important gap in existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

*Jianhui Zhang,Sheng Cheng,Qirui Sun,Jia Liu,Wang Luyang,Chaoyu Feng,Chen Fang,Lei Lei,Jue Wang,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter is a framework for high-resolution text-guided image inpainting that achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining content consistency and prompt alignment through a two-stage adapter architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image inpainting methods are limited to lower resolutions and struggle with maintaining content consistency and prompt alignment as resolution and texture complexity increase.

Method: Uses a two-stage adapter architecture: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and unmasked regions at reduced resolutions for global structural consistency, and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements patch-level attention for full-resolution inpainting with adaptive feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, resolving artifacts common in large-scale inpainting and outperforming existing methods in perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter successfully addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling global semantics from localized refinement, enabling 4K+ resolution inpainting without structural overhauls.

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

### [68] [CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432)
*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS is a collaborative perception method that addresses feature discrepancies in heterogeneous autonomous driving scenarios using domain separation and lightweight alignment modules, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative perception methods assume identical encoders for all agents, which doesn't hold in real-world heterogeneous scenarios. Current approaches are vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and use inefficient transformer-based modules.

Method: Uses Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) for spatial-channel alignment, Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS) with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic modules, and Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss for feature alignment. Employs fully convolutional architecture.

Result: Effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: CoDS successfully addresses feature discrepancies in heterogeneous collaborative perception through domain separation and lightweight alignment, providing efficient and effective solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: A differentiable rendering pipeline that optimizes deformable meshes in 3D to obtain MEIs, enabling characterization of neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D scene properties like shape, pose, and lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels, making it difficult to isolate neuronal selectivity for physical scene properties. There's a need to bridge inverse graphics with systems neuroscience to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli.

Method: Introduced a differentiable rendering pipeline that optimizes deformable meshes directly in 3D. Parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric regularity.

Result: Applied to models of monkey area V4, the approach enables probing neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting. Successfully bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience.

Conclusion: This method offers a way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond conventional pixel-based methods, providing a more interpretable framework for understanding how visual sensory neurons enable robust perception.

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing

*Ole-Christian Galbo Engstrøm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis explores using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis, comparing CNN and PLS models. CNN with joint spatio-spectral analysis outperforms other methods for parameters with chemical and physical visual information. PLS works well for mean chemical content analysis, while CNN with spectral convolution layer produces better chemical maps. Two Python packages were developed for fast PLS modeling and cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve food quality analysis using NIR-HSI technology by developing better modeling approaches that can effectively handle both spatial and spectral information for various food quality parameters.

Method: Used four studies with five research hypotheses comparing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS) models. Specifically tested 2D CNNs with spectral convolution layers, joint spatio-spectral analysis, and developed specialized Python packages for fast PLS modeling and cross-validation.

Result: CNN with joint spatio-spectral analysis outperformed spatial CNN and spectral PLS for parameters with relevant chemical and physical visual information. CNN with spectral convolution layer enhanced predictive performance and produced better chemical maps than PLS. PLS performed equally well for mean chemical content analysis. Barley germination modeling was inconclusive due to low germination rates in dataset.

Conclusion: Joint spatio-spectral CNN analysis is superior for complex food quality parameters, while PLS remains effective for mean chemical content analysis. CNN with spectral convolution layer addresses limitations of PLS for chemical map generation. The developed Python packages provide efficient tools for NIR-HSI analysis.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST3A is a framework that combines text-to-video generators with 3D reconstruction models through model stitching and alignment techniques to create high-quality text-to-3D generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the complementary strengths of modern text-to-video models (generation capability) and 3D reconstruction systems (geometric understanding) for improved text-to-3D generation.

Method: Uses model stitching to connect text-to-video generators with 3D decoders by identifying compatible layers, followed by direct reward finetuning to align the generator with the 3D decoder for consistent geometry.

Result: Markedly improves over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats, and enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation when using suitable 3D base models.

Conclusion: VIST3A successfully demonstrates that combining text-to-video generators with 3D reconstruction models through careful stitching and alignment can create powerful text-to-3D generation systems.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

TL;DR: ExpressNet-MoE is a hybrid deep learning model combining CNNs and Mixture of Experts framework for facial emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world facial emotion recognition faces challenges like variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and demographic diversity. Current models struggle with engagement detection in applications like virtual learning and customer services.

Method: Proposes ExpressNet-MoE with CNN-based feature extractors, MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and residual network backbone. Uses multi-scale feature extraction to capture both global and local facial features, dynamically selecting relevant expert networks.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 74.77% on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong adaptability and practical applicability for end-to-end emotion recognition systems in real-world settings. Code and results are publicly available.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Action Units (facial muscle movements) as non-transient features for incremental learning of complex emotion recognition, showing they outperform CNN features and achieve 0.75 accuracy on CFEE dataset with small memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning for emotion recognition, particularly when learning complex emotions after basic ones, by finding non-transient features that persist across tasks.

Method: Using Action Units (describing facial muscle movements) as stable, semantic features for incremental learning, comparing them against shallow and deep convolutional neural network features.

Result: Achieved 0.75 accuracy on CFEE dataset for incremental learning of complex compound emotions, outperforming CNN-based features and resulting in a lightweight model with small memory footprint.

Conclusion: Action Units are effective non-transient features for incremental emotion recognition that prevent catastrophic forgetting and enable efficient learning of complex emotions with competitive performance.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural parametric 3D breast shape model (liRBSM) enables low-cost 3D surface reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, outperforming existing methods with sub-2mm accuracy in under 6 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an accessible alternative to expensive commercial 3D breast scanning solutions by developing a method that requires no specialized hardware or proprietary software.

Method: Combines Structure-from-motion pipeline with a localized implicit neural representation (liRBSM) that decomposes breast domain into multiple regions with local neural SDFs anchored at anatomical landmarks.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D breast geometry reconstruction with error margin less than 2mm, significantly outperforming the global iRBSM model in reconstruction quality and detail.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers fast, accurate, and accessible 3D breast reconstruction that is fully transparent, open-source, and requires only standard RGB video recording devices.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at

Motivation: Existing UAV datasets struggle to capture real-world complexity for limited imaging conditions, necessitating a more comprehensive dataset and adaptive fusion methods for robust around-the-clock object detection.

Method: Proposed PCDF (prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion) that encodes imaging conditions as text prompts and uses task-specific soft-gating to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions, with a condition-decoupling module for practical use without annotations.

Result: Experiments on the ATR-UMOD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PCDF method for adaptive multimodal object detection under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The ATR-UMOD dataset and PCDF method provide effective solutions for robust UAV-based object detection across varying imaging conditions, with the condition-decoupling module ensuring practical applicability.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVAR-Net is a lightweight audio-visual anomaly recognition framework that combines audio and visual features using Wav2Vec2 and MobileViT, fused with MTCN for temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on new VAAR dataset and XD-Violence benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly recognition methods rely only on visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions like occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. The lack of large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered multimodal anomaly recognition progress.

Method: AVAR-Net uses four modules: audio feature extractor (Wav2Vec2), video feature extractor (MobileViT), early fusion mechanism, and Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) for learning long-range temporal dependencies and cross-modal relationships.

Result: Achieved 89.29% accuracy on VAAR dataset and 88.56% Average Precision on XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over state-of-the-art methods. Introduced new VAAR dataset with 3,000 real-world videos across ten anomaly classes.

Conclusion: AVAR-Net demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability for multimodal anomaly recognition. The VAAR dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition research.

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzes 39 studies on medical image enhancement, finding that conventional mathematical methods dominate (29 studies), while deep learning (9 studies) and hybrid approaches (1 study) are emerging. MRI and multi-modal imaging receive most attention, while specialized modalities remain underexplored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images often suffer from noise, artifacts, and low contrast that limit diagnostic potential, requiring robust preprocessing and enhancement methods to improve quality and interpretability for better clinical outcomes.

Method: Systematic literature review following PRISMA approach, analyzing 39 peer-reviewed studies to investigate challenges, advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image enhancement across different imaging modalities.

Result: Low contrast and noise identified as most frequent challenges. 65 image quality assessment metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. Conventional methods dominate current research, while deep learning shows promise but limited adoption.

Conclusion: The review highlights current limitations and research gaps, particularly in specialized modalities, and suggests future directions for advancing medical image enhancement through more comprehensive evaluation metrics and increased focus on deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified

### [79] [Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13643)
*Akib Mohammed Khan,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies adversarial vulnerabilities and uncertainty calibration in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors, revealing that imperceptible perturbations can cause confident misclassification and that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like DINOv2 show strong few-shot anomaly detection performance, but their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and the calibration of their uncertainty estimates remain unexamined, which is critical for safety-critical applications.

Method: Built on AnomalyDINO (training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features), the study attaches a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features for white-box gradient attacks, evaluates FGSM attacks on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, and applies post-hoc Platt scaling for uncertainty calibration.

Result: Adversarial perturbations consistently degrade performance metrics (F1, AUROC, AP, G-mean), flipping nearest-neighbor relations to cause confident misclassification. Calibrated posteriors show higher predictive entropy on adversarial inputs, enabling attack detection while reducing calibration error.

Conclusion: DINOv2-based anomaly detectors have concrete vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and poor uncertainty calibration. Adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are essential for trustworthy real-world deployment, with the proposed evaluation protocol and baseline addressing these critical gaps.

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

*Sanchar Palit,Subhasis Chaudhuri,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image super-resolution framework using diffusion models with Local-Global Context-Aware Attention and distribution-perceptual alignment to generate high-quality, structurally consistent images from degraded inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution methods struggle with diverse and highly degraded images, leading to noise amplification and incorrect content generation. There's a need for better preservation of local and global pixel relationships.

Method: Proposes Local-Global Context-Aware Attention to maintain pixel relationships, and a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in pixel space that progressively preserves structural information from local details to global composition.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks show the method effectively produces high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions with reduced artifacts and realistic detail restoration.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by maintaining structural consistency and perceptual fidelity, demonstrating superior performance in image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

*Huaizhi Qu,Ruichen Zhang,Shuqing Luo,Luchao Qi,Zhihao Zhang,Xiaoming Liu,Roni Sengupta,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditCast3D is a pipeline that uses video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single frame across entire datasets for efficient 3D editing, addressing computational costs and consistency issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show great promise for image editing but face challenges when extended to 3D editing due to heavy computational demands, closed-source API restrictions, and the impracticality of iterative editing strategies.

Method: The pipeline employs video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset before reconstruction. It introduces a view selection strategy to identify consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and uses feedforward reconstruction without costly refinement.

Result: EditCast3D demonstrates superior editing quality and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines on commonly used datasets.

Conclusion: EditCast3D establishes a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines, minimizing reliance on expensive image editing and mitigating prompt ambiguities.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

TL;DR: OmniGaze is a semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation that uses large-scale unlabeled data from diverse real-world environments to overcome domain bias and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle with generalization across diverse domains due to limited annotated datasets and insufficient diversity in labeled data.

Method: OmniGaze builds a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images and uses pseudo-labeling with a reward model that assesses reliability using visual embeddings and semantic cues from a Multimodal Large Language Model to select high-quality pseudo labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: OmniGaze effectively mitigates domain bias in 3D gaze estimation and serves as a scalable data engine with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes KnowCoL framework for open-domain visual entity recognition using knowledge-guided contrastive learning with Wikidata knowledge to improve zero-shot recognition of unseen entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-domain visual entity recognition faces challenges with fixed label sets, open-set conditions, limited supervision, visual ambiguity, and semantic disambiguation for unseen entities in long-tail distributions.

Method: Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines images and text descriptions in shared semantic space using Wikidata structured information (entity descriptions, type hierarchies, relational context) for zero-shot entity recognition.

Result: Significant improvement in accuracy, especially for rare/unseen entities. Smallest model achieves 10.5% accuracy improvement on unseen entities compared to state-of-the-art while being 35 times smaller.

Conclusion: Combining visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly enhances open-domain visual entity recognition performance, particularly for challenging zero-shot scenarios with unseen entities.

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld is a generative model that creates 3D scenes from single images or text prompts 10-100x faster than previous methods while maintaining superior rendering quality through a novel dual-mode training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) 3D generation methods that are slow and the 3D-oriented approaches that suffer from poor visual quality, aiming to achieve both speed and quality.

Method: Uses a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by cross-mode post-training distillation, integrating MV-oriented and 3D-oriented paradigms. Leverages video diffusion model priors and employs distribution matching from 3D-oriented to MV-oriented modes to enhance quality while maintaining 3D consistency.

Result: Achieves 10-100x faster generation (seconds per scene) compared to previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. The method also reduces required denoising steps and enhances generalization to out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: FlashWorld demonstrates a superior and efficient approach to 3D scene generation that successfully bridges the quality gap in 3D-oriented methods while maintaining speed advantages, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to generate healthy counterfactuals from pathological medical images, outperforming existing methods in preserving individual anatomy while removing pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images is valuable for medical applications like anomaly detection and analysis tools designed for healthy scans, but current methods struggle to balance pathology removal with preservation of individual anatomical features.

Method: The authors use denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) that condition the diffusion process on both the initial healthy image and a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image, treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior.

Result: The proposed DDBM approach outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches in segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: DDBMs effectively generate healthy counterfactuals that closely match patient anatomy while selectively removing pathology, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAS (Risk-adaptive Activation Steering) is a method that reformulates queries to enhance cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment and adaptive activation steering for safe responses without iterative adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with multimodal queries containing harmful intent in images. Training-based safety alignment is costly, while inference-time methods cause excessive refusals and slower inference due to iterative adjustments.

Method: Reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, assess risk at query level, and adaptively steer activations to generate safe responses without iterative output adjustments.

Result: Extensive experiments show RAS significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance, and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAS effectively addresses multimodal safety challenges by enabling accurate risk assessment and adaptive response generation without the overhead of iterative adjustments, outperforming existing inference-time defense methods.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a baseline algorithm combining U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection to extract centerline graphs and morphometric features from Circle of Willis imaging data, achieving high anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skeletonization techniques struggle with the complex geometry of the Circle of Willis, and there's a scarcity of publicly available centerline datasets for cerebrovascular analysis.

Method: Used thinning-based skeletonization to extract centerline graphs from TopCoW dataset (200 stroke patients with MRA/CTA), developed baseline algorithm combining U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection, and evaluated performance on held-out test set.

Result: Achieved perfect graph topology reconstruction (F1=1), average Euclidean node distance below one voxel, strong feature robustness with median relative errors <5% and Pearson correlations >0.95, and successfully predicted fetal PCA variants and detected modality differences.

Conclusion: Learning-based skeletonization combined with graph connection enables anatomically plausible centerline extraction, emphasizing the importance of evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness beyond simple voxel-based measures.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSS-Diff framework synthesizes high-field MRI from low-field MRI using cyclic self-supervised diffusion with anatomical preservation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-field synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI is cheaper and more accessible but suffers from poor resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. There's a need to bridge the clinical fidelity gap while preserving anatomical structures and enhancing fine details.

Method: Cyclic self-supervised diffusion framework with cycle-consistent constraints, slice-wise gap perception network for inter-slice alignment via contrastive learning, and local structure correction network for feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked patches.

Result: Achieved 31.80 ± 2.70 dB PSNR, 0.943 ± 0.102 SSIM, and 0.0864 ± 0.0689 LPIPS. Significantly improved anatomical preservation with left cerebral white matter error dropping from 12.1% to 2.1% and cortex error from 4.2% to 3.7%.

Conclusion: CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent, bridging the domain gap between low-field and high-field MRI.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

*Tianshuo Xu,Kai Wang,Zhifei Chen,Leyi Wu,Tianshui Wen,Fei Chao,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli is a unified diffusion framework that jointly trains Chinese calligraphy recognition and generation, achieving state-of-the-art results by leveraging task synergy for improved character structure preservation and layout aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Chinese calligraphy replication either create high-quality isolated characters but ignore page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempt page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness.

Method: UniCalli employs a unified diffusion framework with asymmetric noising and rasterized box maps for spatial priors, trained jointly on recognition and generation tasks using a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data from a curated dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition performance, and successfully extends to other ancient scripts including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Conclusion: Joint training of recognition and generation tasks creates a synergistic relationship that improves both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes, by fostering concept-level abstractions that preserve character structure while providing style and layout priors.

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InteractiveOmni is a unified open-source omni-modal LLM (4B-8B parameters) that integrates vision, audio, language, and speech capabilities for multi-turn audio-visual interactions, achieving SOTA performance with efficient model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight yet comprehensive omni-modal model that can handle complex multi-turn audio-visual interactions with human-like conversational abilities, addressing the need for accessible foundation models for intelligent interactive systems.

Method: Integrates vision encoder, audio encoder, LLM, and speech decoder into unified architecture; uses multi-stage training (pre-training for omni-modal understanding, post-training for speech conversation and audio-visual interaction); curates multi-turn training dataset for long-term conversational ability.

Result: Significantly outperforms leading open-source models; InteractiveOmni-4B comparable to Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks; retains 97% performance of 8B model with 50% model size; achieves SOTA results across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks.

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni provides an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems with superior multi-turn audio-visual experience and long-term memory capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

*Kai Zou,Ziqi Huang,Yuhao Dong,Shulin Tian,Dian Zheng,Hongbo Liu,Jingwen He,Bin Liu,Yu Qiao,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-MMMU is a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates the bidirectional synergy between visual understanding and generation across eight reasoning domains, revealing performance gaps in current multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to properly evaluate the true integration of visual understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, treating these abilities in isolation rather than examining their coupled nature.

Method: Developed Uni-MMMU benchmark with bidirectionally coupled tasks across eight reasoning domains (science, coding, mathematics, puzzles, etc.), incorporating verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and reproducible scoring for both textual and visual outputs.

Result: Extensive evaluation revealed substantial performance disparities and cross-modal dependencies in state-of-the-art models, showing when and how understanding and generation abilities reinforce each other.

Conclusion: Uni-MMMU establishes a reliable foundation for advancing unified multimodal models by providing systematic evaluation of bidirectional understanding-generation synergy across diverse reasoning domains.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

### [94] [Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787)
*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVC is a diffusion-based framework for story continuation that adaptively uses prior visual context through CLIP-based retrieval and selective conditioning in early diffusion stages, while improving data quality with LLM re-captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in story continuation is effectively utilizing prior visual context while ensuring semantic alignment with current text, avoiding misleading information from irrelevant previous images.

Method: Uses CLIP to retrieve semantically aligned previous images, adaptively restricts visual conditioning to early diffusion stages when no relevant image is found, and improves data quality through LLM-based re-captioning of noisy datasets.

Result: AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared to baselines, especially in challenging cases where prior visuals conflict with current input.

Conclusion: The adaptive visual conditioning approach effectively balances context utilization and semantic alignment, demonstrating improved story continuation performance through selective visual influence and enhanced textual supervision.

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

*Nir Goren,Oren Katzir,Abhinav Nakarmi,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints is a lightweight watermarking scheme for diffusion models that uses the random seed as proof of authorship without modifying the generation process, enabling efficient verification without model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models, proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical, especially when model owners keep models private and third-party verification is needed. Existing methods require model weights and are computationally heavy.

Method: Utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a watermark by incorporating a hash function into noise sampling. The initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with generated content. Uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed.

Result: Validated on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output without requiring model weights. Shows robustness under various manipulations and infeasibility of recovering valid seeds or sampling alternative verification-passing seeds.

Conclusion: NoisePrints provides a practical and scalable solution for diffusion model watermarking that enables third-party verification while maintaining security through seed secrecy and cryptographic proofs.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

*Yiming Chen,Zekun Qi,Wenyao Zhang,Xin Jin,Li Zhang,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Reasoner is a 3D LLM that introduces a dual-path pooling mechanism to create unified 3D representations, enabling autoregressive grounding without external modules and achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D visual grounding and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D LLMs lack unified representations that jointly capture semantic and geometric information, leading to poor grounding performance or excessive reliance on external modules, which hinders the integration of grounding and spatial reasoning.

Method: Proposes a dual-path pooling mechanism that aligns geometric features with semantic and positional cues to create unified image patch-based 3D representations without increasing input tokens. Also introduces Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset with 3D bounding box annotations and step-by-step reasoning paths.

Result: GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results on 3D visual grounding and significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to existing models while being the first to achieve autoregressive grounding without external modules.

Conclusion: The proposed unified 3D representation and GS-Reasoner framework successfully bridge 3D visual grounding and spatial reasoning, establishing a self-contained framework that eliminates the need for external modules while delivering superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trace Anything is a neural network that represents videos as Trajectory Fields - dense mappings of continuous 3D pixel trajectories over time, predicting entire trajectory fields in a single feed-forward pass using B-spline parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental for video dynamics modeling. The pixel serves as the atomic unit tracing continuous 3D trajectories, forming the primitive element of video dynamics.

Method: Represent videos as Trajectory Fields - dense mappings assigning continuous 3D trajectory functions to each pixel. The Trace Anything model predicts control points parameterizing B-spline trajectories for each pixel in each frame in a single feed-forward pass.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on new trajectory field estimation benchmark; competitive performance on established point-tracking benchmarks; significant efficiency gains from one-pass paradigm without iterative optimization; emergent abilities including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Conclusion: The Trajectory Field representation and Trace Anything model provide an effective, efficient approach to video dynamics modeling with emergent capabilities beyond traditional tracking methods.

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisCoP introduces learnable visual probes to augment VLMs' vision encoders for efficient domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods across cross-view, cross-modal, and cross-task settings while preserving source-domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from performance degradation on novel domains with distribution shifts, and existing domain adaptation approaches either learn limited domain-specific features or cause catastrophic forgetting of prior capabilities.

Method: Augment the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of learnable visual probes that enable efficient domain-specific adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters.

Result: VisCoP consistently outperforms existing adaptation strategies across cross-view (exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human understanding to robot control) settings.

Conclusion: VisCoP achieves superior performance on target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge, providing an efficient solution for domain adaptation in VLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysMaster enhances physics-awareness in video generation by learning physical representations from input images and using reinforcement learning with human feedback to optimize these representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models produce visually realistic videos but often violate physical laws, limiting their utility as world models and their ability to generate physically plausible content.

Method: PhysMaster uses PhysEncoder to extract physical information from input images as conditioning for video generation. It applies reinforcement learning with human feedback and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to optimize physical representations end-to-end.

Result: PhysMaster demonstrates improved physics-awareness on proxy tasks and shows generalizability across various physical scenarios, serving as a plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation.

Conclusion: PhysMaster provides a generic framework for physics-aware video generation through representation learning in a reinforcement learning paradigm, enabling physically plausible video synthesis across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The RID Framework is a zero-shot meta-prompting technique that helps LLMs overcome rule-rigidity by enabling human-aligned exception handling, achieving 95% human alignment without expensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent, creating a barrier to trustworthy autonomous agents. Existing solutions like supervised fine-tuning are computationally expensive and inaccessible.

Method: Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework - a low-compute meta-prompting technique that provides structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying decisions.

Result: RID achieved 95% Human Alignment Score compared to 80% for baseline and 75% for Chain-of-Thought prompting on 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment. It consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.

Conclusion: RID presents a practical, accessible method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to goal-oriented reasoning, enabling more reliable and pragmatic AI agents without expensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

*Wei Fan,Wenlin Yao,Zheng Li,Feng Yao,Xin Liu,Liang Qiu,Qingyu Yin,Yangqiu Song,Bing Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPlanner is an RL framework that enhances planning in LLMs by addressing high entropy in planning tokens through token-level advantage shaping and sample-level advantage weighting, achieving SOTA results with lower training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches don't systematically optimize the planning stage in LLMs, with planning tokens showing high entropy under vanilla RL, indicating uncertain decision points that need better optimization.

Method: Proposes DeepPlanner with token-level advantage shaping using entropy-based terms to prioritize high-entropy tokens, and sample-level advantage weighting for planning-intensive rollouts.

Result: Extensive experiments across 7 deep research benchmarks show improved planning quality and state-of-the-art results with substantially lower training budget.

Conclusion: DeepPlanner effectively enhances planning capabilities in deep research agents by systematically addressing planning optimization through entropy-aware RL techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel is the first framework for formally evaluating physical safety of LLM-based embodied agents using temporal logic across semantic, plan, and trajectory levels, outperforming heuristic-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, lacking formal grounding for physical safety requirements in embodied agents operating in physical environments.

Method: Multi-level verification pipeline: (1) semantic level - formalize natural language safety requirements into temporal logic and probe LLM understanding; (2) plan level - verify high-level action plans against TL formulas; (3) trajectory level - merge execution trajectories into computation tree and verify against detailed TL specifications.

Result: Applied in VirtualHome and ALFRED, Sentinel successfully exposed safety violations overlooked by previous methods and provided insights into failure modes of LLM-based embodied agents.

Conclusion: By grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments.

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model achieves 80% accuracy in automatically identifying Driver Hazardous Actions from crash narratives, outperforming traditional ML methods and providing interpretable insights through probabilistic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of Driver Hazardous Actions in crash databases is inconsistent and labor-intensive, limiting reliability for understanding crash causation in the prevalent two-vehicle crashes (70% of roadway crashes).

Method: Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model on five years of two-vehicle crash narratives from MTCF, benchmarked against Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural network classifiers, with probabilistic reasoning for interpretability.

Result: Fine-tuned LLM achieved 80% overall accuracy, surpassing all baseline models, with particular improvements in imbalanced data scenarios. Probabilistic analysis revealed specific patterns: distraction increases 'General Unsafe Driving', mutual distraction maximizes 'Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions', and teen drivers elevate 'Speed and Stopping Violations'.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, enabling new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention through reliable, automated classification of hazardous driving behaviors.

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

### [104] [Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13029)
*Xinlei Wang,Mingtian Tan,Jing Qiu,Junhua Zhao,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes rethinking time series analysis as a reasoning task using LLMs, focusing on causal structure and explainability rather than just numerical regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series analysis fails in real-world dynamic settings where policies shift and unexpected events occur. LLMs offer new opportunities but current methods misuse them for numerical regression instead of leveraging their deeper reasoning potential.

Method: Shift from using LLMs for numerical regression to employing them as reasoning engines that prioritize causal structure and explainability in time series analysis.

Result: The approach brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: Time series analysis should be rethought as a reasoning task using LLMs to uncover actual driving forces behind trends, moving beyond surface-level pattern recognition to provide explainable, causal insights.

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

### [105] [Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13036)
*Stephane Hatgis-Kessell,Logan Mondal Bhamidipaty,Emma Brunskill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PBRR is an automated framework that repairs human-specified proxy reward functions by learning additive corrections from preferences, requiring fewer preferences than learning rewards from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-designed reward functions are often misaligned with true objectives, causing reward hacking, while learning rewards from human preferences is costly.

Method: PBRR learns an additive, transition-dependent correction term to the proxy reward function using targeted exploration and a new preference-learning objective.

Result: PBRR outperforms baselines in reward-hacking benchmarks, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high-performing policies, with theoretical guarantees in tabular domains.

Conclusion: PBRR effectively bridges the gap between hand-designed rewards and preference-based RL, enabling efficient reward alignment with minimal human feedback.

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

*Qun Ma,Xiao Xue,Xuwen Zhang,Zihan Zhao,Yuwei Guo,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an emotional cognition framework for LLM-based agents that incorporates desire generation and objective management to achieve emotion alignment with humans, improving ecological validity and human-like decision-making in societal simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents have severe limitations in affective cognition - they fail to simulate bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services, and lack empirically validated integration mechanisms for embedding emotions within agent decision architectures.

Method: Constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents including state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. Implemented within a proprietary multi-agent interaction environment.

Result: Agents governed by the framework exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states and, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed emotional cognition framework successfully enables LLM-based agents to achieve emotion alignment with humans, producing more realistic and human-like behaviors in societal simulations through comprehensive modeling of affective decision-making processes.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A complementary agent system that uses small LLMs for initial answers and large LLMs for verification and deep reasoning only when needed, reducing computational costs by over 50% for simple problems with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of applying deep reasoning from large LLMs to all problems, especially simple ones where it's unnecessary.

Method: A two-stage system where a small LLM generates initial answers, then a large LLM verifies them - adopting correct answers directly and only performing deep reasoning when verification fails.

Result: Reduces large LLM computational cost by more than 50% for simple problems with negligible accuracy loss, while maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Conclusion: The complementary agent system effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy by strategically deploying large LLMs only when necessary.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

TL;DR: Pxplore is a novel framework for Personalized Learning Path Planning that uses reinforcement learning and LLMs to create adaptive, goal-aligned learning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for personalized learning lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning, limiting their effectiveness in creating truly adaptive learning experiences.

Method: Integrates reinforcement-based training with LLM-driven educational architecture, using structured learner state modeling, automated reward functions, and training combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths, deployed within a real-world learning platform.

Conclusion: Pxplore successfully addresses the goal-alignment challenge in personalized learning and the framework shows promise for future educational applications.

Abstract: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning
paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show
potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack
mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework
for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces J-TTL benchmark for evaluating AI agents' test-time learning ability and proposes EvoTest framework that evolves agent configurations without fine-tuning, achieving superior performance on text adventure games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents lack the ability to learn complex skills at test time, behaving like 'clever but clueless interns' in novel environments, which severely limits their practical utility.

Method: EvoTest framework with two roles: Actor Agent plays the game, and Evolver Agent analyzes episode transcripts to propose revised configurations (prompt rewriting, memory updates, hyperparameter tuning, tool-use routines) without any fine-tuning or gradients.

Result: EvoTest consistently increases performance on J-TTL benchmark, outperforming reflection, memory-only baselines, and online fine-tuning methods. It's the only method capable of winning two games (Detective and Library) while all baselines fail to win any.

Conclusion: The evolutionary test-time learning approach enables AI agents to effectively improve performance across consecutive episodes without requiring gradient-based updates, addressing a fundamental limitation in current agent capabilities.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

*Jalal Khan,Manzoor Khan,Sherzod Turaev,Sumbal Malik,Hesham El-Sayed,Farman Ullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a utility-based analytical model for autonomous vehicle perception systems using YOLOv8s for object detection, validated on a custom dataset with distinctive objects like motorcyclists and rickshaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate perception model for autonomous vehicles that can detect multiple objects on the road and predict driver perception to control vehicle movements, addressing the need for enhanced AI-enabled solutions in smart mobility.

Method: Uses a three-module approach: custom dataset acquisition with distinctive objects, YOLOv8s deep learning model for object detection, and a utility measurement module to evaluate perception service based on trained model performance metrics.

Result: Three best-performing YOLOv8s instances achieved mAP@0.5 values: SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). AdamW-based model showed superior class-level performance (car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793) compared to SGD-based model.

Conclusion: The proposed utility-based perception model effectively evaluates learning models and determines appropriate perception for autonomous vehicles, with AdamW-based YOLOv8s showing the best overall performance despite slightly lower mAP than SGD-based model.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

*Weiqi Guo,Guanjun Liu,Ziyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAJA is a joint state-action attack framework for MADRL that synergistically perturbs both states and actions using gradient ascent methods, outperforming single-vector attacks while remaining stealthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MADRL models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but current research only focuses on state-only or action-only attacks separately, missing the potential synergistic effects of joint attacks.

Method: Two-phase gradient ascent approach: (1) state attack using actor and critic networks to compute adversarial states, (2) action attack using critic network on perturbed states to craft final adversarial actions, with a heuristic regularizer for enhanced guidance.

Result: SAJA outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks in MPE environment, and existing defense methods cannot defend against its attacks.

Conclusion: Joint state-action attacks like SAJA demonstrate superior effectiveness and stealth compared to single-vector attacks, highlighting the need for more comprehensive defense strategies in MADRL systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

*Yunxiao Zhao,Zhiqiang Wang,Xingtong Yu,Xiaoli Li,Jiye Liang,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PORAT is a game-theoretic approach that addresses mode collapse in rationalization by introducing policy interventions to guide models toward optimal equilibria, achieving up to 8.1% performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional rationalization methods suffer from mode collapse where predictors produce correct predictions but generators output collapsed rationales, lacking unified solutions for this fundamental problem.

Method: Proposes PORAT (Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization) that systematically introduces policy interventions to address game equilibrium in cooperative rationalization processes.

Result: Validated on nine real-world datasets and two synthetic settings, PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PORAT successfully addresses the fundamental cause of mode collapse in rationalization through game-theoretic interventions, providing a unified solution for guiding models toward optimal equilibria.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Liesbeth Allein,Nataly Pineda-Castañeda,Andrea Rocci,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate logically coherent causal chains between cause-effect pairs but rely more on associative pattern matching than genuine causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities in discovering implicit causal chains between cause-effect pairs, particularly in argumentation contexts like climate change discussions.

Method: Instructed nine LLMs to generate intermediate causal steps for cause-effect pairs from climate change argumentation resources, then analyzed the chains for number, granularity, self-consistency, and confidence.

Result: LLMs varied in causal step production but were generally self-consistent and confident; human evaluations confirmed logical coherence, though reasoning was primarily associative rather than genuinely causal.

Conclusion: The study provides a baseline approach, diagnostic insights, and benchmark dataset for advancing implicit mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Motivation: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and precise identification of service weak spots are crucial for network operators to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE).

Method: Uses crowdsourced QoE data with coverage analysis at individual cell level aggregated to site level using empirical geolocation data. Applies One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm to model decision hyperplane as effective coverage contour for robust coverage area calculation.

Result: The framework effectively maps mobile coverage and highlights granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly within complex urban environments.

Conclusion: The novel framework demonstrates efficacy in accurately mapping mobile coverage and identifying geographically localized weak spots using crowdsourced service loss reports.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a training-free method that uses token-level confidence in LLM's final answers as a reward proxy, particularly for close-ended tasks. It outperforms existing training-free approaches and most trained reward models on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extensive curated data and costly training required by traditional reward models, while leveraging the observation that model confidence can effectively distinguish between reasoning paths.

Method: Systematically investigates CRew method using token-level confidence in model's final answers as reward proxy. Also proposes CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals.

Result: CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, surpasses most trained reward models, shows strong correlation with actual reasoning performance, and effectively filters high-quality training data. CRew-DPO further enhances judging capabilities and outperforms existing self-training methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-as-a-Reward is a simple yet powerful training-free method that effectively serves as a reward proxy, with CRew-DPO providing additional performance gains through confidence-based preference training.

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in measuring GenAI performance in financial services, proposing a Risk Assessment Framework to better integrate SME evaluation and machine learning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Barriers to GenAI adoption in finance include inadequate performance metrics that don't generalize well, over-reliance on SME evaluation, and failure to account for unique risks in metric selection. Existing benchmarks from research institutions also don't suit industrial applications.

Method: The paper develops a Risk Assessment Framework designed to improve the application of both Subject Matter Expert evaluation and machine learning metrics for GenAI performance measurement.

Result: The framework helps address the generalization issues of traditional metrics and research benchmarks when applied to industrial GenAI workloads in financial services.

Conclusion: A structured risk assessment approach is needed to effectively measure GenAI performance in financial services, combining SME insights with appropriate machine learning metrics while accounting for domain-specific risks.

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

### [117] [Tandem Training for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13551)
*Robert West,Ashton Anderson,Ece Kamar,Eric Horvitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tandem training is a reinforcement learning method that teaches strong language models to produce solutions intelligible to weaker models by intermittently sampling rollout tokens from a frozen weak model during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models improve, their reasoning becomes harder for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. The goal is to ensure models produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators.

Method: Formalizes intelligibility as handoff robustness and introduces tandem training - an RL paradigm where rollout tokens are randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. This forces the strong model to produce solutions that can be continued by the weaker model.

Result: In GSM8K math reasoning, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while maintaining high task accuracy.

Conclusion: Tandem training provides a promising approach to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with important implications for human-AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

*Cecilia Di Florio,Huimin Dong,Antonino Rotolo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modal logic framework for machine learning classifiers used in legal case-based reasoning, incorporating temporal dimensions and court hierarchies to resolve precedent conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally model and verify machine learning classifiers in legal applications, specifically addressing how these systems perform case-based reasoning and handle conflicts between legal precedents.

Method: Developed a modal logic of classifiers that incorporates temporal dimensions of cases and hierarchical court structures to resolve conflicts between precedents in legal case-based reasoning.

Result: Created a formal logic framework that can capture legal case-based reasoning performed by ML classifiers, including mechanisms for handling precedent conflicts through temporal ordering and court hierarchy.

Conclusion: The proposed modal logic provides a formal foundation for building verification tools for ML classifiers in legal applications, enabling better handling of precedent conflicts through temporal and hierarchical reasoning.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

### [119] [Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13709)
*Evan Ellis,Vivek Myers,Jens Tuyls,Sergey Levine,Anca Dragan,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empower is a new method for training assistive language models that maximizes human empowerment rather than task completion, using only offline text data without requiring explicit human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assistive agents tend to complete tasks independently rather than truly assisting humans, and often require costly explicit human feedback for training.

Method: Proposed Empower method maximizes human empowerment (ability to effect desired changes) using only offline text data, providing self-supervised fine-tuning for language models.

Result: In user studies, participants preferred Empower assistant 78% of the time with 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. In coding tasks, Empower increased success rate by 192% over baseline.

Conclusion: Empower provides a framework for creating aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data, eliminating the need for additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

### [120] [From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13727)
*Ravi Pandya,Madison Bland,Duy P. Nguyen,Changliu Liu,Jaime Fernández Fisac,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes control-theoretic guardrails for AI agents that proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, treating AI safety as a sequential decision problem rather than relying on static classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety approaches based on output classification are brittle and offer no recovery path when unsafe conditions are detected, simply refusing to act which isn't always safe. Agentic AI safety requires addressing downstream hazards from evolving interactions.

Method: Formalizes AI safety through safety-critical control theory within the AI model's latent representation, building predictive guardrails that monitor outputs in real-time and proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones in a model-agnostic manner. Uses safety-critical reinforcement learning for training.

Result: Experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce show control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (collisions, bankruptcy) while preserving task performance.

Conclusion: Control-theoretic guardrails offer a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block approaches, enabling proactive safety correction rather than just detection and refusal.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

*Shrey Pandit,Austin Xu,Xuan-Phi Nguyen,Yifei Ming,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hard2Verify is a human-annotated benchmark for step-level verification in mathematical reasoning, designed to test verifiers' ability to catch errors in frontier LLM-generated proofs for challenging math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based reasoning systems achieve high performance in mathematical competitions like IMO 2025, there's a need for strong step-level verifiers to ensure proof correctness and proper justification at each step during training.

Method: Created Hard2Verify benchmark with 500+ hours of human annotation, evaluating 29 generative critics and process reward models on their ability to provide step-level annotations or identify first errors in LLM-generated responses to recent, challenging math questions.

Result: Evaluation shows open-source verifiers generally lag behind closed-source models, with only a few standout performers. The study analyzes factors driving poor performance, scaling effects of verifier compute, and fundamental questions about self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

Conclusion: Hard2Verify provides a rigorous benchmark for step-level verification, revealing significant performance gaps between open-source and closed-source verifiers, and highlighting the need for improved verification capabilities to support advanced mathematical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

TL;DR: Robots can learn generalizable grasping by training on simple "toy" objects composed of basic shape primitives, achieving strong zero-shot performance on real-world objects through object-centric visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation policies struggle with generalization to novel objects, while children develop dexterous skills by mastering simple toys and applying that knowledge to complex items. The paper aims to achieve similar generalization capabilities in robots.

Method: Train robots on randomly assembled objects composed of four shape primitives (spheres, cuboids, cylinders, rings) using an object-centric visual representation with a proposed detection pooling mechanism.

Result: Achieves 67% real-world grasping success rate on YCB dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that use more in-domain data. Shows robust zero-shot generalization to real-world objects.

Conclusion: Training on simple "toy" objects enables scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation, offering a promising path for developing robust manipulation policies that can handle novel objects.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration

### [123] [Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces as Control Barrier Functions for Safe Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12919)
*Mouhyemen Khan,Tatsuya Ibuki,Abhijit Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified framework that uses Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPIS) as control barrier functions (CBFs) for safety-critical control, with sparse variants to address computational scaling issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge level set methods in safety control (CBFs) and geometric shape representation (distance fields) by using implicit surfaces directly as CBFs, leveraging GPIS for uncertainty-aware safety boundaries.

Method: Use GPIS to represent safety boundaries conditioned on sensor-derived safety samples. The GP posterior mean defines the safety surface, while variance provides safety margins. Develop sparse Gaussian CBFs to address cubic scaling of standard GPs.

Result: Validated on collision avoidance tasks: 7-DOF manipulator around Stanford bunny and quadrotor navigating around physical chair. Both standard and sparse Gaussian CBFs enabled safe interaction and collision-free trajectory execution.

Conclusion: GPIS can effectively synthesize CBFs for safety-critical control, with sparse variants maintaining performance while reducing computational burden. The approach enables safe operation in complex environments where trajectories would otherwise intersect obstacles.

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

### [124] [Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral for Agile UAV Control with Online Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12924)
*Pavel Pochobradský,Ondřej Procházka,Robert Pěnička,Vojtěch Vonásek,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GMPPI is a sampling-based controller for UAVs that combines geometric SE(3) control with MPPI framework, enabling agile trajectory tracking and online obstacle avoidance at high speeds (up to 13m/s in simulation, 10m/s in real-world).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a controller that can track agile trajectories while avoiding obstacles in complex environments, addressing limitations of existing MPPI implementations in handling both precision agile flight and obstacle avoidance.

Method: Uses sampling-based MPPI framework with geometric SE(3) control for generating rollout trajectories, varying simulation time steps, dynamic cost/noise parameters, and integrates with stereo depth camera for online obstacle avoidance.

Result: Achieves position error similar to geometric SE(3) controller for agile tracking, avoids obstacles at 13m/s in simulated forest (surpassing state-of-the-art planners), and maintains 10m/s obstacle avoidance in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: GMPPI successfully combines agile trajectory tracking with high-speed obstacle avoidance, demonstrating practical autonomous UAV flight capabilities in complex environments.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

### [125] [Enhancing Sampling-based Planning with a Library of Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12962)
*Michal Minařík,Vojtěch Vonásek,Robert Pěnička*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to speed up 3D path planning by reusing past solutions from a library, achieving up to 85% faster planning compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based planners struggle with narrow passages and start from scratch for each new object, losing valuable planning experience. This is inefficient for applications like robotic bin-picking where multiple objects need to be planned in the same environment.

Method: Create a library of past path solutions. For new objects, find the most similar object in the library, use its paths as approximate solutions, adjust for transformations, and sample the configuration space along these approximate paths.

Result: Significant speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in required time) compared to state-of-the-art OMPL methods. The method often finds solutions where other planners fail, especially in narrow passage scenarios.

Conclusion: Reusing past planning experiences through a solution library is an effective approach for accelerating 3D path planning, particularly in challenging scenarios with narrow passages. The method has been implemented as an open-source package.

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a controller for elongate limbless robots inspired by C. elegans' omega turns, using wave equation superposition to enable effective turning in cluttered environments, with generalization to multi-legged robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable elongate limbless robots to effectively maneuver in tightly packed spaces for applications like search-and-rescue and industrial inspections, addressing the limited research on turning strategies for such systems.

Method: Used a comparative theory-biology approach to prescribe omega turns as superposition of two traveling waves, then designed controllers based on these wave equations for limbless robots.

Result: Successfully implemented robust and effective turning behaviors in both lab and cluttered field environments, with the controller also generalizing to elongate multi-legged robots.

Conclusion: The omega turn controller provides an effective body-driven turning strategy that works for elongate robots both with and without limbs, demonstrating broad applicability across different robot morphologies.

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Result: Achieves 14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks compared to prior methods, requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

Conclusion: Actron3D provides an effective framework for learning transferable manipulation skills from minimal human video demonstrations, significantly outperforming existing approaches while being more data-efficient.

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only
human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact
object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a
14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while
requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UNCAP enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while accounting for perception uncertainty, achieving 63% bandwidth reduction and 31% safety improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAV coordination approaches either transmit high-bandwidth raw sensor data or ignore perception uncertainties, making systems unscalable and unsafe.

Method: Two-stage communication protocol: (1) identify relevant vehicles for information exchange, (2) selected CAVs transmit messages expressing perception uncertainty, with selective fusion of messages that maximize mutual information.

Result: 63% reduction in communication bandwidth, 31% increase in driving safety score, 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and 4x increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Conclusion: UNCAP provides scalable and safe cooperative planning for CAVs through uncertainty-guided natural language communication and selective information fusion.

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Development of a hardware-in-the-loop testbed using a 6-DOF robotic arm on a satellite bus with 1-DOF guide-rail system to emulate and validate ISAM operations in space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAM operations improve space assets but present complex control challenges due to perturbation forces from robotic arm movements on free-flying satellites. Experimental validation is difficult in 6-DOF space environments.

Method: Created a HIL testbed with UR3e 6-DOF robotic arm attached to satellite bus mounted on 1-DOF guide-rail system, allowing free linear movement to emulate space conditions.

Result: Experimental system developed to explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot manipulation, and contact mechanics in ISAM operations.

Conclusion: The testbed provides a practical solution for experimentally testing and validating dynamical models of ISAM operations that are otherwise challenging to test in actual 6-DOF space environments.

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

TL;DR: Kinematic Kitbashing is an automatic framework that synthesizes functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models through optimization that ensures geometric soundness and satisfies functional goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design by enabling rapid creation of interactive articulated assets that satisfy specific functional requirements.

Method: Uses a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function features across articulation snapshots, embedded within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that handles non-differentiable functionality objectives and constraints.

Result: Produces diverse articulated shapes (trash-can wheels on cars, multi-segment lamps, gear-driven paddlers, reconfigurable furniture) and shows strong quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric, kinematic, and functional metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully couples articulation-aware geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, empowering rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

TL;DR: VLA-0 demonstrates that representing robot actions directly as text in Vision-Language-Action models is surprisingly effective, outperforming more complex approaches on benchmarks and in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA approaches add complexity through modified vocabularies or special action heads, while the simplest strategy of representing actions as text remains unexplored.

Method: VLA-0 uses text-based action representation without complex modifications to existing Vision-Language Models, employing specific design techniques to unlock high performance.

Result: VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods on LIBERO benchmark, including π₀.₅-KI, OpenVLA-OFT, SmolVLA, and even methods trained on large-scale robotic data like π₀, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. It also outperforms SmolVLA in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Text-based action representation in VLAs is not only effective but surprisingly powerful, outperforming more complex approaches when properly designed, challenging current assumptions about VLA architecture complexity.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboHiMan is a hierarchical evaluation paradigm that introduces HiMan-Bench for systematically assessing compositional generalization in long-horizon robot manipulation under diverse perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus primarily on task completion but offer limited insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay between planning and execution in hierarchical robot systems.

Method: Proposes RoboHiMan with HiMan-Bench benchmark containing atomic and compositional tasks under perturbations, multi-level training datasets for progressive data scaling analysis, and three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled) to probe skill composition necessity.

Result: Experiments reveal clear capability gaps across representative models and architectures, identifying bottlenecks in hierarchical systems for long-horizon manipulation.

Conclusion: The work points to directions for advancing models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks by systematically addressing compositional generalization challenges.

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

TL;DR: DAMM-LOAM is a LiDAR SLAM system that addresses degeneracy in pose estimation through point cloud classification and degeneracy-aware ICP, improving accuracy in challenging environments like sparse features and repetitive structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR SLAM systems struggle with degeneracy in 6-DOF pose estimation in environments with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency motion, limiting LiDAR-only solutions.

Method: Proposes a degeneracy-aware multi-metric approach with point cloud classification (ground, walls, roof, edges, non-planar points), degeneracy-based weighted least squares ICP, and Scan Context-based loop closure.

Result: DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy, particularly in challenging indoor environments like long corridors.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses degeneracy issues in LiDAR SLAM through multi-metric classification and degeneracy-aware optimization, enabling more robust performance in feature-sparse environments.

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FARM is an imitation learning framework that uses high-dimensional tactile data to infer force signals and define force-based action spaces for contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning approaches treat visuotactile feedback only as additional observations, leaving applied forces uncontrolled as a consequence of gripper commands, which is insufficient for handling fragile or deformable objects.

Method: Collect human demonstrations using modified UMI gripper with GelSight Mini tactile sensor, then use FARM diffusion policy to jointly predict robot pose, grip width, and grip force during deployment with an actuated gripper variant.

Result: FARM outperforms baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements (high-force, low-force, dynamic force adaptation), demonstrating advantages of force-grounded tactile observations and force-based control space.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates tactile data for force inference and control, enabling better manipulation performance across varying force requirements, with code and designs open-sourced.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced

*Shingo Ayabe,Hiroshi Kera,Kazuhiko Kawamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline RL policies are brittle to action-space perturbations. This paper introduces adversarial fine-tuning with adaptive curriculum to improve robustness while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL is sample-efficient but policies trained on static datasets are fragile to action-space perturbations like actuator faults, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Train policies on clean data offline, then perform adversarial fine-tuning by injecting perturbations into executed actions. Use performance-aware curriculum with exponential-moving-average to adapt perturbation probability during training.

Result: Method improves robustness over offline-only baselines, converges faster than training from scratch. Matching fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields strongest robustness. Adaptive curriculum prevents nominal performance degradation seen with linear curriculum.

Conclusion: Adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under uncertainty, bridging offline efficiency with online adaptability.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

TL;DR: A transfer learning framework using EMG signals for knee joint angle prediction that achieves high accuracy with minimal data from new subjects, demonstrating strong generalization for rehabilitation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EMG-based joint angle prediction methods face limitations in real-time applicability, non-representative test conditions, and require large datasets for optimal performance.

Method: Developed a lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM model pre-trained on Georgia Tech dataset and transferred to UCI and SMLE datasets. Used EMG channels relevant to knee motion, with optional historical knee angles and interaction force inputs.

Result: Achieved NMAE of 6.8% and 13.7% for one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG alone. With historical angles, reduced to 3.1% and 3.5% for normal subjects, and 2.8% and 7.5% for abnormal subjects. On SMLE exoskeleton with full inputs, achieved 1.09% and 3.1% NMAE.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term rehabilitation scenarios, requiring only a few gait cycles from new subjects.

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

TL;DR: Training quadruped robots on oscillating bridges using RL improves their stability and adaptability to dynamic ground perturbations, enabling robust locomotion without prior real-world exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots perform well on rough terrains but their capabilities on vertically oscillating surfaces remain underexplored, creating a need to enhance locomotion robustness under dynamic ground perturbations.

Method: Used Reinforcement Learning with PPO algorithm in MuJoCo simulation to train 15 locomotion policies combining five gaits with three training conditions (rigid bridge, oscillating bridge with different height regulation strategies), employing domain randomization for zero-shot real-world transfer.

Result: Policies trained on oscillating bridges showed superior stability and adaptability compared to rigid surface training, enabling robust gait patterns without prior bridge exposure.

Conclusion: Simulation-based RL can effectively improve quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, providing valuable insights for designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

TL;DR: Hockens-A Hand is a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand that uses a single linear actuator to achieve three grasping modes (parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, enveloping) through mechanical intelligence from Hoeckens mechanism, double-parallelogram linkage, and four-bar linkage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robotic hand that can adapt to unstructured environments with minimal actuation, using passive mechanical intelligence for compliance and multiple grasping capabilities.

Method: Integration of Hoeckens mechanism (for compliance), double-parallelogram linkage (for line contact), and four-bar amplification system (for mode transitions), with mesh-textured silicone phalanx. Used kinematic analysis, simulations, and 3D-printed prototype testing.

Result: Successfully demonstrated three adaptive grasping modes in various scenarios, showing grasping stability and broad applicability. Simulations validated smooth transitions between modes and proper fingertip motion.

Conclusion: The Hockens-A Hand achieves effective adaptive grasping with single-actuator simplicity, mechanical intelligence, and compliance suitable for unstructured environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental

Motivation: To create a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective robotic gripper that can handle various object geometries in unstructured environments without requiring additional actuators for mode switching.

Method: Modified the original Hoecken linkage by replacing one member with differential links, added a differential spring mechanism, and used a double-parallelogram arrangement to maintain fingertip parallelism. The design can be driven by a single linear actuator and was prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing.

Result: Achieved a linear pinching span of approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests showed reliable grasping in both pinching and adaptive modes across various object geometries. The mechanism successfully transitions between modes contact-triggered without additional actuators.

Conclusion: The Hoecken-D Hand presents a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for robotic manipulation that combines the benefits of parallel pinching and adaptive envelope grasping in a single underactuated design suitable for unstructured environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework using only tactile data to simultaneously determine shape and location of rigid objects with minimal robot motion, leveraging physical constraint violation penalties and Expected Information Gain exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General robot manipulation requires handling unseen objects, and tactile sensing can complement vision with occlusion robustness, but its temporal sparsity requires careful online exploration for data efficiency while preventing object movement during contact.

Method: Builds on contact-rich system identification to formulate a loss function penalizing physical constraint violation without numerical stiffness from rigid-body contact. Uses Expected Information Gain exploration scheme to maximize learning efficiency.

Result: Learns cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Exploration scheme results in significantly faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient simultaneous shape and location estimation of rigid objects using only tactile data, achieving rapid learning with minimal robot motion through physical constraint-based optimization and information-maximizing exploration.

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

Conclusion: PlanarMesh provides an efficient solution for real-time 3D LiDAR mapping with compact, high-quality reconstructions.

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,

sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than

Motivation: To enable robotic manipulators to handle delicate agricultural produce without damage by controlling grasping force and identifying produce qualities like ripeness and bruising.

Method: Integration of a low-cost, easy-to-fabricate flexible pressure sensor with both rigid robotic grippers and pneumatically actuated soft fingers, plus an algorithm for accelerated steady-state estimation from transient response data.

Result: The sensor successfully provides force feedback for grasping objects of unknown sizes and stiffnesses, estimates object properties, and enables real-time applications through the proposed acceleration algorithm.

Conclusion: The pressure sensor system enables future applications in produce identification, quality control, and selective distribution based on ripeness levels, advancing agricultural automation capabilities.

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft

steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A visualization methodology for offline analysis of lidar scan matching discrepancies using vector-field plots to help human analysts identify and classify adversity modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help human analysts classify adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching by revealing patterns difficult to extract from raw point-cloud data.

Method: Generates vector-field plots characterizing local discrepancies between registered point clouds for offline analysis, allowing iterative removal of adversity mechanisms.

Result: Successfully applied to simulation study and field experiment, enabling human analysts to reason about adversity mechanisms and iteratively remove them from raw data.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively aids analysts in focusing attention on progressively smaller discrepancies in lidar scan matching through visual pattern recognition.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision remains a significant barrier in robotics, with many tasks hindered by inefficient vision systems. The research aims to address this by leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks optimized for computationally constrained robotic environments.

Abstract: Within the field of robotics, computer vision remains a significant barrier
to progress, with many tasks hindered by inefficient vision systems. This
research proposes a generalized vision module leveraging YOLOv9, a
state-of-the-art framework optimized for computationally constrained
environments like robots. The model is trained on a dataset tailored to the
FIRA robotics Hurocup. A new vision module is implemented in ROS1 using a
virtual environment to enable YOLO compatibility. Performance is evaluated
using metrics such as frames per second (FPS) and Mean Average Precision (mAP).
Performance is then compared to the existing geometric framework in static and
dynamic contexts. The YOLO model achieved comparable precision at a higher
computational cost then the geometric model, while providing improved
robustness.

TL;DR: VLA models show high success rates on benchmarks but have fundamental robustness weaknesses. Systematic vulnerability testing across 7 dimensions reveals models are brittle, with performance dropping dramatically under modest perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the robustness vulnerabilities of Visual-Language-Action models that appear successful on benchmarks but may have underlying weaknesses.

Method: Introduced controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures, and sensor noise. Comprehensive analysis of multiple state-of-the-art models.

Result: Models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbations, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest changes. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations and tend to ignore language instructions completely.

Conclusion: High benchmark scores don't equate to true competency. There's a need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation rather than just reporting success rates on static benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vision-based drone autonomy in both controlled and challenging uninstrumented environments, showing performance matching professional human pilots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous drone systems are limited in direct applicability to commercial operations as they're trained and evaluated in highly controlled environments, lacking real-world validation.

Method: The system's capabilities are analyzed in a controlled environment with external tracking for ground-truth comparison, and also demonstrated in a challenging uninstrumented environment without ground-truth measurements.

Result: The approach matches the performance of professional human pilots in both controlled and uninstrumented environments. Flight data from both the system and a world-class human pilot are publicly released.

Conclusion: Vision-based autonomous drone systems can achieve human-level performance even in challenging real-world scenarios without instrumentation, bridging the gap between controlled research environments and practical field applications.

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

*Miana Smith,Paul Arthur Richard,Alexander Htet Kyaw,Neil Gershenfeld*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for fabricating large-scale structures using simple robots and interlocking lattice blocks, combining digital fabrication at small scales with robotic assembly at meter scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for large-scale digital fabrication are complex, expensive, and unreliable, creating a need for more accessible and scalable approaches.

Method: The approach involves voxelizing target structures, grouping voxels into larger blocks produced via standard fabrication, and using mobile robots to assemble these blocks into meter-scale structures with a live digital twin for coordination.

Result: The system successfully demonstrated voxelization, hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of meter-scale objects.

Conclusion: This work enables scalable macroscale fabrication using simple robots and interlocking building blocks, making large-scale digital fabrication more accessible and reliable.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
meter-scale objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: InternVLA-M1 is a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that uses spatially guided vision-language-action training to connect instructions with robot actions through a two-stage pipeline of spatial grounding pre-training and spatially guided action post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence by creating a critical link between instructions and robot actions through spatial grounding.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) spatial grounding pre-training on 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine "where to act" by aligning instructions with visual positions, and (2) spatially guided action post-training to decide "how to act" by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting.

Result: Outperformed variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka. Achieved 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects, 7.3% improvement in real-world clustered pick-and-place, and +20.6% on unseen objects with synthetic co-training. Surpassed existing works by over 10% in long-horizon reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: Spatially guided training serves as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots, enabling consistent performance gains across various robotic platforms and tasks.

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.
