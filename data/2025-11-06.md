### [1] [Cropland Mapping using Geospatial Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02923)
*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth enable efficient and accurate cropland mapping in Togo, simplifying workflows and supporting land use change assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Land cover maps are crucial for understanding land use change as a climate change driver, but current geospatial embedding applications in real-world mapping remain limited.

Method: Used geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth to produce cropland maps in Togo.

Result: Geospatial embeddings achieved high-accuracy cropland classification and simplified mapping workflows.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings provide an efficient and accessible approach for cropland mapping that can better support land use change assessments and climate impact analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints is a training method that enforces known invariances across the entire input space using virtual examples from generative models, outperforming standard data augmentation in learning properties like spatial invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation alone doesn't fully capture invariant properties since it only learns from transformations of training data, failing to enforce invariances across the entire input space.

Method: Leverages generative models trained on the dataset to create virtual examples, then trains models in a semi-supervised manner using both classification and hint objectives on these unlabeled virtual examples to enforce desired properties.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard data augmentation across datasets, architectures, and loss functions. Achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement on fine-grained visual classification benchmarks and 1.286% average boost on CheXpert X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: Generative hints effectively enforce known invariances across the entire input space, providing superior performance over traditional data augmentation methods for learning invariant properties.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for ecology that learns to infer missing modalities from context modalities, supports modality inversion, and enables cross-modal retrieval with mixed similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a multimodal embedding model for ecology that can handle any-to-any generation of multimodal representations and address the challenge of modality fusion and missing data in ecological applications.

Method: Based on masked modality reconstruction in embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities given context modalities. Uses probabilistic modeling to analyze modality fusion feasibility and proposes cross-modal retrieval with mixed inter-modal and intra-modal similarities.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance across all retrieval tasks and shows strong representation learning capability through linear probing tasks.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides an effective probabilistic framework for multimodal representation learning in ecology, enabling modality inversion, cross-modal retrieval, and analysis of modality fusion feasibility.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV -- A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV is a large-scale event camera dataset from YouTube footage with 13B+ events, enabling self-supervised depth estimation without frame annotations and improving generalization to complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer HDR and low latency for robust depth estimation, but existing approaches are limited by small annotated datasets that constrain real-world generalizability.

Method: Curated EvtSlowTV dataset from YouTube footage containing diverse environmental conditions and motions, used in self-supervised learning framework that preserves event data's asynchronous nature without frame-based annotations.

Result: EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets, and training with it enhances model generalization to complex scenes and motions while leveraging HDR potential of raw event streams.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the dataset gap for event-based depth estimation, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world scenarios without requiring frame annotations.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hybrid CNN-ViT neural architecture search space is proposed to find efficient hybrid architectures for image classification, specifically targeting tinyML deployment with tight model size constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid CNN-ViT architectures require large parameters and computational costs, making them unsuitable for tinyML deployment where model size and efficiency are critical constraints.

Method: Developed a new hybrid CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that includes hybrid CNN and ViT blocks for local/global information learning, and a novel Pooling block with searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR10 show the proposed search space produces hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference speed compared to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed NAS-based approach successfully finds efficient hybrid CNN-ViT architectures suitable for tinyML deployment, outperforming traditional ResNet models in both accuracy and speed while maintaining small model sizes.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework that integrates volumetric spatial semantics and domain-aware knowledge to improve cross-modal alignment for medical CT data, achieving superior performance in retrieval, classification, and report generation tasks with strong cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language models are limited to 2D data and binary supervision, overlooking continuous and structured dependencies in volumetric medical data like CT scans. Existing approaches treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics.

Method: Proposes SCALE-VLP framework that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide alignment using soft-weighted contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Shows consistent gains in zero-shot evaluation on out-of-domain external datasets.

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP demonstrates strong cross-task transferability and cross-domain generalizability without further fine-tuning, indicating its effectiveness in creating structurally consistent and semantically grounded representations for medical volumetric data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-efficient approach using self-supervised learning for statewide 1-m land cover classification with only 1,000 annotated patches, achieving 87.14% accuracy for mapping Mississippi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of collecting large volumes of training data for high-resolution land cover mapping by developing a label-efficient approach using self-supervised learning.

Method: Used BYOL self-supervised pre-training with 377,921 unlabeled color-infrared aerial patches on ResNet-101, then transferred to multiple segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, etc.) and fine-tuned with small datasets (250-750 patches).

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using ensemble U-Net models for 8-class land cover mapping over Mississippi's 123 billion pixels, with accurate water/forest mapping but challenges in cropland/herbaceous/barren distinction.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning effectively reduces the need for large annotated datasets, addressing a major limitation in high-resolution land cover mapping at scale.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model for brain MRI that handles different combinations of imaging sequences using a single encoder with learnable modality embeddings and masked autoencoding, eliminating the need for separate models per modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible brain MRI model that can work with various modality combinations and handle missing sequences, avoiding the need for separate models for each imaging sequence.

Method: Uses one encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and masked autoencoding objective with variance-covariance regularizer. Trained on ~60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised reconstruction and modality imputation.

Result: Preliminary results show feasible performance. Planned evaluation includes brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation, and lesion classification under various modality settings.

Conclusion: The method enables flexible brain MRI analysis with missing or unseen modalities using a single foundation model, with code and pretrained models publicly available.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP introduces structural contrastive learning to VLP by modeling relationships between entities in graphs, outperforming CLIP on cross-modal tasks using Amazon product co-purchase data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP methods treat image-text pairs as isolated examples, ignoring rich relational structures present in domains like e-commerce and social networks, while neuroscience shows humans encode knowledge as relationship cognitive maps.

Method: SLIP integrates structural contrastive loss to align modalities while modeling relationships between neighboring entities in structured graphs, using a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset.

Result: SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Relational supervision provides significant value for cross-modal alignment, demonstrating the importance of structural information in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for evaluating uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds without ground truth, using geometric features and optimal neighborhood estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth for uncertainty evaluation in MLS point clouds is costly and often infeasible in real-world applications, creating a need for GT-free evaluation methods.

Method: Learning-based framework integrating optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction, using XGBoost and Random Forest models.

Result: XGBoost achieves comparable accuracy to Random Forest with 3x faster efficiency, showing geometric features can predict point-level uncertainty measured by C2C distance.

Conclusion: MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, providing a novel learning-based approach to uncertainty evaluation research without ground truth dependency.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computational imaging framework combining Compressive Sensing with Light-Sheet Microscopy enables high-speed, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging by using compressed acquisition and advanced reconstruction algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical imaging struggles with capturing dynamic cellular structure in beating hearts due to spatial-temporal resolution trade-offs, requiring new methods for efficient cardiac imaging.

Method: Uses compressed acquisition via DMD with random binary masks, and a Plug-and-Play ADMM framework incorporating Tikhonov, TV, and BM3D denoisers with temporal regularization for structural continuity.

Result: Successfully reconstructs zebrafish heart cellular structures under high compression ratios with excellent denoising performance and image clarity.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and robust for real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

### [12] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception is the first hybrid dataset for detecting Intermeshed Steel Connection components, combining synthetic CAD images, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and curated real photos to enable automatic labeling and reduce human effort by 81.7% compared to manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dependable perception is crucial for ISC-aware robots in steel-frame assembly, but hindered by the lack of dedicated image data due to logistical difficulties and safety/privacy concerns on active construction sites.

Method: Created a hybrid dataset blending procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and curated real photographs, with fully automatic labeling of synthetic portions and detailed accounting of all human effort involved.

Result: Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved mean Average Precision of 0.756 at IoU 0.50, substantially outperforming models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data, with bench test results of 0.943/0.823 mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95].

Conclusion: ISC-Perception bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, enabling rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat is a 3D reconstruction framework for orthodontic treatment that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with sparse input images (anterior and bilateral buccal views), overcoming limitations of conventional methods that require dense multi-view inputs and precise camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic treatment in telemedicine requires observing dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints, but conventional 3DGS methods need dense inputs and precise camera poses, which are impractical for clinical cases with only three sparse images.

Method: Uses prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction to initialize point clouds, scale-adaptive pruning for training efficiency, and incorporates optical flow as geometric constraint with gradient regularization for rendering fidelity in sparse scenarios.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases, the method effectively handles sparse inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: DentalSplat provides an effective solution for 3D reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery, enabling better dental occlusion visualization in telemedicine contexts.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [14] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD is a support set free framework that leverages image intrinsic priors in IC SEM images for defect detection and novel class discovery, addressing challenges in supervised methods and clustering-based unsupervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrated circuit manufacturing involves complex processes where defects can occur at any stage, causing yield loss and reliability issues. Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent and rare defects, while clustering-based unsupervised methods suffer from unstable performance due to missing priors.

Method: The framework includes: 1) Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection using learnable normal information extractor and reconstruction residuals for coarse defect localization; 2) Adaptive binarization strategy for stable subimages focusing on core defective areas; 3) Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification with soft mask guided attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into teacher-student model.

Result: The approach was validated on a real-world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrated robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: IC DefectNCD provides an effective solution for defect detection and novel class discovery in IC manufacturing, overcoming limitations of existing supervised and unsupervised methods by leveraging image intrinsic priors and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication

### [15] [Accelerating Physical Property Reasoning for Augmented Visual Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03126)
*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \sysname accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning from 10-20 minutes to under 6 seconds through geometric 3D reconstruction, semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding, achieving 62.9x-287.2x speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable augmented visual cognition by minimizing the latency of vision-guided physical property reasoning, making it practical for real-time applications on smart glasses in cluttered environments.

Method: Combines algorithmic and systematic optimizations including rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding to accelerate the reasoning pipeline.

Result: Reduces end-to-end latency from 10-20 minutes to less than 6 seconds (62.9x-287.2x speedup) while achieving on-par or better object-level physical property estimation accuracy, superior material segmentation, and voxel-level inference compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: \sysname provides robust physical property estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios, as demonstrated in a case study with Meta Aria Glasses at an IKEA store, showing consistently high performance compared to controlled captures.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [16] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for automated building damage assessment using sUAS imagery deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, processing 415 buildings in 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data avalanche problem where sUAS teams collect 47GB-369GB of imagery per day during disasters, overwhelming transmission and human analysis capabilities and delaying response efforts.

Method: Developed models trained on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS imagery (21,716 building damage labels) and operationally trained 91 disaster practitioners. Deployed best performing model during actual disaster responses.

Result: Successfully deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, assessing 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes, establishing the first operational state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment.

Conclusion: This work establishes the operational state of practice for AI/ML-based building damage assessment using sUAS imagery and provides valuable documentation and lessons learned for the research and user communities.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

### [17] [Finetuning-Free Personalization of Text to Image Generation via Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03156)
*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning-free personalization method for text-to-image diffusion models using Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images, eliminating per-subject optimization at inference while maintaining subject fidelity and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subject-specific fine-tuning approaches like DreamBooth are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods still require additional fine-tuning or large backbone models. The goal is to develop a more efficient personalization approach without per-subject optimization.

Method: Uses Hypernetworks to predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images with an end-to-end training objective stabilized by output regularization. Introduces Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG) that combines base diffusion model's compositional strengths with personalized model's subject fidelity during sampling.

Result: Achieves strong personalization performance on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench datasets. The method preserves both subject fidelity and prompt alignment without per-subject optimization at test time.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, offering computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

### [18] [Subsampled Randomized Fourier GaLore for Adapting Foundation Models in Depth-Driven Liver Landmark Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03163)
*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework using SAM2 and DA2 encoders with SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning, achieving improved performance on surgical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate anatomical structure detection in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging due to limited depth perception in 2D video streams, requiring better fusion of RGB and depth features and efficient adaptation of large vision models to surgical domains.

Method: Uses SAM2 encoder for RGB features and DA2 encoder for depth features, introduces SRFT-GaLore (Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform) for efficient fine-tuning of attention layers, and employs cross-attention fusion to integrate RGB and depth cues.

Result: Achieves 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance on L3D dataset compared to D2GPLand, and maintains competitive performance on new LLSD dataset with strong cross-dataset robustness.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings, demonstrating strong adaptability to unseen surgical environments.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

*Shreyas C. Dhake,Jiayuan Huang,Runlong He,Danyal Z. Khan,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Sophia Bano,Hani J. Marcus,Danail Stoyanov,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset for surgical anticipation, and SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video-language model that uses GRU-based temporal encoding and gated cross-attention to predict future surgical events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VQA systems only reason on isolated frames and lack support for forecasting future steps, which is critical in endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Proposed SurgAnt-ViVQA model adapts a large language model using GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module, with bidirectional GRU for frame dynamics and adaptive gating for visual context injection. Uses parameter efficient fine-tuning for surgical domain adaptation.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA outperforms strong image and video baselines on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets. Ablations show temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most gains. 8 frames maximize fluency while 32 frames improve numeric time estimation.

Conclusion: The model advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation. PitVQA-Anticipation provides a comprehensive benchmark and highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for future-aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

*Kuei-Chun Kao,Hsu Tzu-Yin,Yunqi Hong,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that improves multimodal LLMs' ability to handle multi-image reasoning tasks by addressing fine-grained perception and information integration challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception across multiple images and effective reasoning over multiple visual inputs, with existing methods focusing mainly on single-image scenarios.

Method: Proposed Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a zero-shot prompting approach that handles arbitrary numbers of images by guiding the generation of detailed captions through question-driven processes.

Result: QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across multi-image and single-image benchmarks, showing robust improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: QG-CoC effectively addresses the limitations of current prompting methods in multi-image contexts and provides a generalized solution for complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer network that uses 3D body shape scans and self-reported medical data for cesarean section risk prediction, achieving 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for early CS risk assessment in resource-limited settings where traditional in-hospital parameters are unavailable, enabling better prenatal care decisions.

Method: Multi-view Transformer network (MvBody) using 3D optical body scans and self-reported medical data with metric learning loss for data-scarce environments, plus Integrated Gradients for explainability.

Result: Superior performance with 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC compared to existing methods, identifying key predictors including body shape around head/shoulders, pre-pregnancy weight, and maternal age.

Conclusion: 3D body shape analysis combined with basic medical data provides feasible CS risk prediction for resource-limited settings, with transparent decision-making through explainable AI.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

*Nikolina Tomic Roshni Bhatnagar,Sarthak Jain,Connor Lau,Tien-Yu Liu,Laura Gambini,Rima Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method for translating between color flow doppler and greyscale ultrasound videos achieves realistic results with SSIM of 0.91, indistinguishable from real videos in classification tasks and clinician evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance and missingness in ultrasound imaging, particularly for sub-modalities like greyscale and color flow doppler that are often imbalanced in clinical studies.

Method: Leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses with two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging, trained on 54,975 videos.

Result: Synthetic videos achieved average SSIM of 0.91±0.04, performed indistinguishably from real videos in DL classification (F1 score 0.89 vs 0.9) and segmentation (Dice score 0.97), with clinicians achieving only 54±6% accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances ultrasound datasets through realistic video translation, expanding utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augmenting dataset design for medical imaging, with foundational abilities demonstrated across multiple clinical domains.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

*Pengyu Jie,Wanquan Liu,Rui He,Yihui Wen,Deyu Meng,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MCPMix and RLA - a diffusion-guided augmentation method that combines sample mixing and generative synthesis for endoscopic segmentation, achieving SOTA performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing augmentation methods: sample mixing causes soft label ambiguity from misaligned masks, while diffusion synthesis introduces domain shift and overlooks structural benefits of mask conditioning.

Method: 1) Generate synthetic counterparts for real images under same masks using diffusion, 2) Apply Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix) to mix only appearance while keeping original hard masks, 3) Use Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) to adaptively adjust mixing strength and loss weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017 datasets with consistent gains over baselines.

Conclusion: Combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity and adaptive re-anchoring yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL is a novel prompt learning method that uses adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantics, improving generalization across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp struggle to generalize to unseen categories and primarily focus on text-based modifications, leaving image-based augmentation unexplored. There's a need to guide prompt learning toward semantically meaningful visual features.

Method: Proposes AAPL (Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning) which introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations, enabling learned prompts to focus on visually discriminative features aligned with target categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets show AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

Conclusion: Image-level augmentations with attribute-specific variations can significantly enhance prompt learning, and AAPL's adversarial approach effectively improves generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful visual features.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-PMambaSR is a lightweight super-resolution framework that combines window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable fine-grained modeling across different scales while maintaining linear complexity, outperforming recent Transformer and Mamba methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based super-resolution methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, limiting feature representation efficiency. The quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based approaches also needs to be addressed.

Method: Integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields of different scales, and introduces an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover lost high-frequency details.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed T-PMambaSR framework successfully establishes a fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature representation with linear complexity, effectively addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: To address the challenge of early stages providing both low-level fundamental features to deep stages and high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors simultaneously, which is crucial for practical deployment efficiency.

Method: Introduces a lightweight bypass module for functional decomposition of shallow features, develops a high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages, and implements a decoupled optimization with two-phase loss weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through both architectural design and model optimization, achieving superior inference efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

### [29] [IEC3D-AD: A 3D Dataset of Industrial Equipment Components for Unsupervised Point Cloud Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03267)
*Bingyang Guo,Hongjie Li,Ruiyun Yu,Hanzhe Liang,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IEC3D-AD, a new 3D anomaly detection dataset for industrial equipment components collected from real production lines, and proposes GMANet, a novel 3D-AD method using geometric morphological analysis and spatial discrepancy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec 3D-AD fail to capture the complexities and subtle defects in real industrial environments, limiting precise anomaly detection research for industrial equipment components such as bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: The authors develop IEC3D-AD dataset from actual production lines and introduce GMANet - a 3D-AD paradigm that generates synthetic point cloud samples via geometric morphological analysis, then optimizes spatial discrepancy to reduce margin and increase overlap between normal and abnormal point-level features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets, showing improved performance in 3D anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: IEC3D-AD provides a more realistic and challenging dataset for industrial 3D anomaly detection, while GMANet offers an effective approach for detecting subtle defects in industrial equipment components through geometric analysis and feature optimization.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting using LoRA-fine-tuned diffusion models with overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising to generate arbitrarily long videos without seams or artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of generating long videos and achieving high controllability in video inpainting/outpainting simultaneously, as prior methods struggle with fixed-length clips and exhibit stitching artifacts.

Method: Leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained video diffusion models (Wan 2.1) for masked region synthesis, and employs overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.

Result: Enables arbitrarily long video generation and editing without noticeable seams or drift, outperforming baseline methods (Wan 2.1, VACE) in quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS) on challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks over hundreds of frames.

Conclusion: Achieves practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, balancing parameter efficiency and superior performance for controllable video inpainting and outpainting.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-SDPO introduces a safeguarded update rule for diffusion-based Direct Preference Optimization that prevents degradation of preferred outputs by adaptively scaling loser gradients, improving alignment with human preferences in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO has a pathology where enlarging preference margins can increase reconstruction errors for both winner and loser branches, potentially degrading generation quality even for preferred outputs.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-SDPO with safeguarded update rule that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient based on its alignment with the winner gradient, using a closed-form scaling coefficient from first-order analysis.

Result: Across standard text-to-image benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO is a simple, model-agnostic method that adds minimal computational overhead while effectively improving human preference alignment in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

TL;DR: SurgViVQA is a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes using temporal cues, outperforming existing methods on colonoscopic video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA approaches in surgery are limited to static image features and lack temporal annotations, ignoring critical dynamics needed for accurate procedural interpretation.

Method: Uses a Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features capturing temporal cues like motion and tool-tissue interactions, then decodes with a fine-tuned LLM.

Result: Outperforms existing image-based VQA models by +11% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA, with improved robustness to question phrasing variations.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA provides a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling better interpretation of dynamic procedural contexts.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that addresses lip synchronization and semantic consistency issues through a dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture with cross-modal interaction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency due to ineffective cross-modal modeling.

Method: Uses dual-branch joint synthesis with parallel Diffusion Transformers, Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction for bidirectional cross-attention, Face-Aware Modulation to prioritize salient regions, and Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance for enhanced cross-modal correlation.

Result: Achieves superior audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency with significantly fewer training samples (1.3M vs 30.1M) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust unified framework that enables multiple audio-video tasks within a single model while delivering improved cross-modal consistency and synchronization.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

TL;DR: Automated method for standardizing embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound images using PCA to extract principal axes and three selection strategies (Pearson correlation, atlas matching, Random Forest) with 98.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized alignment of embryos in 3D ultrasound images facilitates prenatal growth monitoring by enabling standard plane detection, improving landmark visualization, and accentuating differences between scans.

Method: PCA applied to embryo segmentation masks to extract principal axes, generating four candidate orientations. Three selection strategies: Pearson correlation heuristic, atlas-based normalized cross-correlation, and Random Forest classifier. Majority voting combines all three methods.

Result: Tested on 2166 3D ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies (7+0 to 12+6 weeks). PCA correctly extracted principal axes in 99.0% of images. Selection accuracy: Pearson Heuristic 97.4%, Atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%. Majority Vote achieved 98.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: High-accuracy pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in first trimester, supporting scalable analysis in clinical and research settings. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extension of Shape-from-Template (SfT) to handle topological changes during deformation by iteratively adapting the template through spatial domain partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfT methods fail when topological changes occur during deformation, limiting their practical applicability for real-world scenarios involving tears and cuts.

Method: Initialize with classical SfT solution, then iteratively adapt template by partitioning spatial domain to minimize energy functional combining physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.

Result: Method robustly captures topological events like tears and cuts on 2D surfaces, outperforming baseline methods on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Establishes first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT, enabling reconstruction of deformable objects with topological changes.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric body models rely on costly 3D scans and proprietary shape spaces that are demographically narrow, limiting accessibility and diversity in human-centric 3D modeling.

Method: Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space using phenotype parameters (gender, age, height, weight) to control blendshapes, calibrated with WHO population statistics to ensure realistic demographic variation.

Result: Anny supports millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery. HMR models trained with Anny match the performance of scan-based models while being interpretable and broadly representative.

Conclusion: Anny provides an accessible, open-source foundation for human-centric 3D modeling with semantic control and demographic diversity, released under Apache 2.0 license to promote broader adoption.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that scales coordinate channels by local signal intensity, improving localization performance in biomedical data compared to traditional coordinate-channel approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization tasks in biomedical data require learning spatial/temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions. Traditional approaches like CoordConv layers use pure coordinate channels, but these don't incorporate signal intensity information directly.

Method: Replace pure coordinate channels with channels scaled by local signal intensity, creating an intensity-position coupling in the input representation. This provides a modality-agnostic inductive bias.

Result: Evaluated on ECG signal transition timing prediction and nuclear center coordinate regression in cytological images. The proposed representation achieved faster convergence and higher generalization performance in both 1D and 2D biomedical signals.

Conclusion: The signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation is effective across different dimensionalities of biomedical signals, outperforming conventional coordinate-channel approaches in localization tasks.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation in human monitoring systems, as conventional cameras capture identifiable information while event cameras only record pixel intensity changes.

Method: Lightweight 3DCNN modeling spatial-temporal dynamics, using focal loss with class reweighting and data augmentation to address class imbalance.

Result: F1-score of 0.9415 and 94.17% accuracy, outperforming C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3% on composite Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.

Conclusion: Event-based deep learning enables accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body part features and interpersonal relations to infer social groups, outperforming prior methods on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook nuanced cues like facial expressions and gestures, relying instead on holistic representations and directly detecting groups without modeling underlying interactions, limiting their ability to capture localized social signals.

Method: Detects individuals and enhances features using part-aware cues, then infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based reasoning that considers both spatial relations and subtle social cues.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the NVI dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed part-aware bottom-up approach enables more accurate social group inference by explicitly modeling fine-grained interactions through body part features and interpersonal relations.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

Motivation: Existing video explanation methods produce entangled explanations that don't clearly separate motion from spatial context, and language-based approaches struggle to explain tacit motions that are hard to verbalize.

Method: Uses a concept bottleneck design with three disentangled concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. Motion concepts are defined as pose sequences while object/scene concepts are automatically extracted using a large language model.

Result: Experiments on KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 datasets show DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. User study validates superior interpretability, and the framework benefits model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE successfully addresses the challenge of disentangling motion from context in video action recognition explanations, providing clearer interpretability while maintaining strong recognition performance.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

### [42] [Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02937)
*Mirco Felske,Jannik Redenius,Georg Happich,Julius Schöning*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework to address the unique challenges of autonomous agricultural systems by providing a structured method for defining and verifying operational boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts don't address the unique challenges of agricultural automation, which integrates both driving and working processes with distinct operational constraints in complex, variable environments.

Method: The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements: 1) Ag-ODD description concept using ASAM Open ODD and CityGML, 2) extended 7-Layer Model with process layer for dynamic operations, and 3) iterative verification process against logical scenarios.

Result: The framework provides a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD descriptions, with demonstrative use cases showing support for standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions.

Conclusion: The Ag-ODD Framework successfully addresses the gap in existing ODD concepts for agricultural applications, enabling structured, transparent, and verified environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that
operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications,
agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which
imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring
consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a
structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,
existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique
challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,
which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of
autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core
elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured
method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters
using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model
derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process
layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative
verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical
scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness
and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating
unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD
Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental
descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

### [43] [Comprehensive Assessment of LiDAR Evaluation Metrics: A Comparative Study Using Simulated and Real Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02994)
*Syed Mostaquim Ali,Taufiq Rahman,Ghazal Farhani,Mohamed H. Zaki,Benoit Anctil,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores evaluation metrics for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans in Virtual Testing Environments for Autonomous Driving Systems, finding Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) performs best across various test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive physical testing of Autonomous Driving Systems is impractical due to cost and safety concerns, so Virtual Testing Environments need validation by comparing their sensor outputs against real-world counterparts.

Method: Developed a comprehensive experimental approach to evaluate metrics for comparing real and simulated LiDAR scans, testing sensitivity/accuracy with various noise, density, distortion, and sensor settings. Created VTEs using real LiDAR data collected in controlled environments and generated simulated scans using the same poses.

Result: Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) performed best across all test cases. Real and simulated LiDAR scans showed similar semantic segmentation (mIoU 21% with corrected intensity) and average DCD of 0.63, indicating slight geometric differences but significant model output differences. DCD was most correlated with perception methods.

Conclusion: Density Aware Chamfer Distance is the most effective metric for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans in Virtual Testing Environments for Autonomous Driving Systems validation.

Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is
required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive
conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,
Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing
VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong
indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this
work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation
metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The
metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,
density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing
the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best
across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing
Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in
a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle
equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from
the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans
were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and
simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU
of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance
(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties
of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model
outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be
the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

*Markus Buchholz,Ignacio Carlucho,Yvan R. Petillot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AURA is a collaborative framework that integrates LLMs, digital twins, and human interaction for real-time anomaly detection and diagnostics in robotics, using a two-agent system with continuous learning from human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings requires combining human expertise with AI-driven analysis, especially for unforeseen anomalies.

Method: Two-agent architecture: (1) State Anomaly Characterization Agent monitors telemetry and converts signals to natural-language problem descriptions; (2) Diagnostic Reasoning Agent conducts knowledge-grounded dialogue with operators to identify root causes, with human-validated diagnoses used to refine the perceptual model.

Result: Framework establishes a pattern for trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams by progressively distilling expert knowledge into AI.

Conclusion: AURA transforms AI from a static tool into an adaptive partner through a feedback loop that integrates human expertise, enabling resilient and trustworthy autonomous systems.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings
requires a paradigm that combines human expertise with AI-driven analysis,
especially when anomalies are unforeseen. We introduce AURA (Autonomous
Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics
in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity
digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to
anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear
roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors
telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem
description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a
knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing
on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new
training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback
loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from
a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating
principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for
trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.

*R. Khorrambakht,Joaquim Ortiz-Haro,Joseph Amigo,Omar Mostafa,Daniel Dugas,Franziska Meier,Ludovic Righetti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-based approach using unstructured play data to learn world models and action samplers, combined with MCTS planning for robotic tasks, showing significant improvements over behavior cloning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior cloning policies are difficult to transfer to new tasks and require careful demonstrations with frequent environment resets, making data collection challenging. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Collect unstructured play data to learn: 1) action-conditioned visual world model, 2) diffusion-based action sampler, 3) optional reward model. Use MCTS planner with world model and action sampler, executed via Model Predictive Controller.

Result: Validated on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying complexity. Planning approach significantly outperforms behavior cloning baselines on standard manipulation test environment.

Conclusion: Model-based planning with learned world models and action samplers from unstructured data provides better performance than behavior cloning, with the action sampler effectively mitigating world model hallucinations during planning.

Abstract: Robots must understand their environment from raw sensory inputs and reason
about the consequences of their actions in it to solve complex tasks. Behavior
Cloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this
knowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to
transfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it
requires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to
such policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we
collect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an
action-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and
optionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action
sampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of
actions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The resulting plans are
executed on the robot via a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We
show that the action sampler mitigates hallucinations of the world model during
planning and validate our approach on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying
levels of planning and modeling complexity. Our experiments support the
hypothesis that planning leads to a significant improvement over BC baselines
on a standard manipulation test environment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Libname is an open-source library that converts 3D printers into automated tactile sensor calibration devices, enabling large-scale data collection for calibrating vision-based tactile sensors like DIGIT and GelSight Mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensor calibration is essential for robotic manipulation but remains labor-intensive and ad hoc. Current methods require substantial manual effort, limiting practical deployment of tactile sensing in robotics.

Method: Use 3D printers as automated probing devices to generate labeled training data. Train custom convolutional neural networks to reconstruct depth maps from the collected tactile sensor data.

Result: Successfully calibrated DIGIT and GelSight Mini sensors to produce high-quality depth maps. Data ablation study determined optimal data requirements for accurate calibration. Models demonstrated good generalization on unseen objects.

Conclusion: Libname automates tactile sensor calibration, accelerating research, simplifying deployment, and promoting practical integration of tactile sensing in robotic platforms.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a key role in enabling dexterous and reliable robotic
manipulation, but realizing this capability requires substantial calibration to
convert raw sensor readings into physically meaningful quantities. Despite its
near-universal necessity, the calibration process remains ad hoc and
labor-intensive. Here, we introduce \libname{}, an open-source library that
transforms a low-cost 3D printer into an automated probing device capable of
generating large volumes of labeled training data for tactile sensor
calibration. We demonstrate the utility of \libname{} by calibrating two
commercially available vision-based tactile sensors, DIGIT and GelSight Mini,
to reconstruct high-quality depth maps using the collected data and a custom
convolutional neural network. In addition, we perform a data ablation study to
determine how much data is needed for accurate calibration, providing practical
guidelines for researchers working with these specific sensors, and we
benchmark the trained models on previously unseen objects to evaluate
calibration accuracy and generalization performance. By automating tactile
sensor calibration, \libname{} can accelerate tactile sensing research,
simplify sensor deployment, and promote the practical integration of tactile
sensing in robotic platforms.

TL;DR: SENT-Map is a semantically enhanced topological map that uses JSON text format to represent indoor environments, enabling autonomous navigation and manipulation through foundational models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a map representation that both humans and foundational models can understand, allowing semantic information to be easily added and edited while preventing infeasible states during robot deployment.

Method: Two-stage approach: first mapping the environment with a Vision-FM alongside an operator, then using the SENT-Map representation with natural-language queries within an FM for planning.

Result: Semantic enhancement enables even small locally-deployable foundational models to successfully plan over indoor environments.

Conclusion: SENT-Map provides an effective framework for semantic-aware robot navigation and manipulation by leveraging foundational models in a human-understandable JSON format.

Abstract: We introduce SENT-Map, a semantically enhanced topological map for
representing indoor environments, designed to support autonomous navigation and
manipulation by leveraging advancements in foundational models (FMs). Through
representing the environment in a JSON text format, we enable semantic
information to be added and edited in a format that both humans and FMs
understand, while grounding the robot to existing nodes during planning to
avoid infeasible states during deployment. Our proposed framework employs a two
stage approach, first mapping the environment alongside an operator with a
Vision-FM, then using the SENT-Map representation alongside a natural-language
query within an FM for planning. Our experimental results show that
semantic-enhancement enables even small locally-deployable FMs to successfully
plan over indoor environments.

*Xin Liu,Jinze Wu,Yinghui Li,Chenkun Qi,Yufei Xue,Feng Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A motion prior-based deep reinforcement learning approach enables a hexapod robot to learn natural gaits and achieve robust walking on complex terrains without visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-legged robots have enhanced stability for complex terrains but face challenges in coordinating multiple legs effectively in large action spaces to generate natural and robust movements.

Method: Generate a dataset of optimized motion priors and train an adversarial discriminator based on these priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits using deep reinforcement learning.

Result: The learned policy was successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, demonstrating natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness in complex terrains without visual information.

Conclusion: This represents the first successful application of a reinforcement learning controller for complex terrain walking on a real hexapod robot.

Abstract: Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains
with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to
effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space
to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we
introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep
reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a
dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator
based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The
learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and
demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual
information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement
learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real
hexapod robot.

### [49] [Learning-based Cooperative Robotic Paper Wrapping: A Unified Control Policy with Residual Force Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03181)
*Rewida Ali,Cristian C. Beltran-Hernandez,Weiwei Wan,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based framework combining LLM task planning with hybrid IL/RL policy using Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) achieves 97% success rate in gift wrapping tasks, enabling robust deformable object manipulation through sub-task temporal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-robot cooperation is challenging in environments handling deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics due to unpredictable dynamics and adaptive force control needs. Gift wrapping exemplifies these long-horizon manipulation problems.

Method: Integrates high-level LLM task planner with low-level hybrid IL/RL policy using START transformer that learns unified policy from human demonstrations with sub-task IDs for temporal grounding, capturing long-range dependencies across full wrapping sequences.

Result: Achieves 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks, reducing need for specialized models while allowing controlled human supervision and bridging high-level intent with fine-grained force control.

Conclusion: The unified transformer-based policy effectively handles deformable object manipulation by learning sub-goals rather than motion sequences, supporting flexible execution and robust performance across entire wrapping processes.

Abstract: Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and
retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,
bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains
difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the
need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the
task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem
involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.
Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly
wrapped package with clean folds and no tears.
  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task
planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid
imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is
a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from
human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike
vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short
tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal
grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process
and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than
merely replicating motion sequences.
  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We
show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized
models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level
intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object
manipulation.

*Zeqing Zhang,Weifeng Lu,Lei Yang,Wei Jing,Bowei Tang,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a novel RL approach using human-designed admittance control for physical human-robot collaboration in board-insertion tasks, achieving better success rates, faster completion, and reduced human effort compared to traditional admittance control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional admittance control in pHRC tasks has limitations in accurately measuring human force/torque for intent estimation, while pure RL methods are unsuitable due to safety constraints and sparse rewards in board-insertion tasks.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning with a human-designed admittance controller to enable more active robot behavior and reduce human effort in collaborative board-insertion tasks.

Result: Outperforms admittance control in success rate and task completion time, with significant reduction in measured force/torque, validated through simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed RL approach with admittance control facilitates effective physical human-robot collaboration for complex tasks like board insertion, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task
involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and
a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it
can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for
accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the
collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using
reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task
due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel
RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate
more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance
control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we
observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our
proposed approach compared to admittance control. The video of the experiments
is available at https://youtu.be/va07Gw6YIog.

*Minquan Gao,Xinyi Li,Qing Yan,Xiaojian Sun,Xiaopan Zhang,Chien-Ming Huang,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDES is a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained robot policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural changes, improving task success rates and motion precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained robot policies lack semantic awareness of foundation models, but replacing them is impractical due to high costs and loss of accumulated knowledge.

Method: Uses a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, encodes them into guidance embeddings injected into policy's latent space, with LLM-based Reflector for inference-time robustness monitoring.

Result: Extensive validation in RoboCasa simulation shows consistent improvements in task success rates across diverse policy architectures. Real-world deployment on UR5 robot demonstrates enhanced motion precision for critical sub-tasks.

Conclusion: GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies by adding semantic awareness.

Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic
systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often
lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing
them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss
of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a
lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance
from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs
a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual
instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance
embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,
allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,
targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language
model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence
is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves
relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.
Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse
policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task
success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that
GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.
Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,
rather than replace, validated robot policies.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of research-led value elicitation and emphasizes user-centered, context-aware design considerations in developing socially assistive robots for mental health support.

Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly
impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects,
adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.
Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising
opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step
toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values
that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this
study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health
academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the
design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through
creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored
scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of
values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported
interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant
values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support
for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of
a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and
context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive
robots.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS/ROS 2 bags, enabling natural language interaction with robot data through LLMs/VLMs, and benchmarks tool calling capabilities across various AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is scarce literature at the intersection of Agentic AI and Embodied AI, despite MCP becoming a key enabler for agentic applications. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing tools for robotics data analysis.

Method: Developed an MCP server with robotics-specific tooling for ROS/ROS 2 bag analysis, including trajectory analysis, laser scan data, transforms, and time series data. Also created a lightweight UI for benchmarking different LLMs/VLMs.

Result: Experimental results show significant divide in tool calling capabilities across eight state-of-the-art models, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating superior performance. Success rates are affected by tool description schema, number of arguments, and available tools.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges Agentic and Embodied AI by providing practical MCP-based tools for robotics data analysis, while identifying key factors affecting LLM/VLM performance in tool calling tasks.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key
research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and
enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of
these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper
introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for
analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through
LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain
knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting
natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time
series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2
CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to
filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP
server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling
with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source
(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling
capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both
proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that
there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude
Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that
there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool
description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools

### [55] [Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550)
*Hong Wang,Ridhima Phatak,James Ocampo,Zhao Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of humans having inaccurate mental models of robots' field of view (FoV), which can lead to collaboration failures. The authors propose four AR-based FoV indicators and evaluate them through a user study with 41 participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans often mistakenly assume robots have the same field of view as humans, leading to impossible task requests and collaboration failures, especially when robots cannot scan scenes while performing tasks.

Method: Proposed four augmented reality (AR) FoV indicators spanning from egocentric (robot's eye/head space) to allocentric (task space), and conducted a user experiment with 41 participants to evaluate accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload.

Result: Allocentric blocks at task space had highest accuracy but with delay in interpreting FoV. Egocentric indicators (deeper eye sockets) also increased accuracy. All indicators maintained high participant confidence and low cognitive load.

Conclusion: The study contributes six guidelines for practitioners to apply AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.

Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans
have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of
robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot
collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks
about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a
chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned
tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we
propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user
human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,
confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum
from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).
Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest
accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator
of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased
accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive
load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to
apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models
with robots' vision capabilities.

### [56] [OneOcc: Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Legged Robots with a Single Panoramic Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03571)
*Hao Shi,Ze Wang,Shangwei Guo,Mengfei Duan,Song Wang,Teng Chen,Kailun Yang,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OneOcc is a vision-only panoramic semantic scene completion framework for legged/humanoid robots that addresses gait-induced body jitter and 360° continuity through dual-projection fusion, bi-grid voxelization, hierarchical decoding, and gait displacement compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic scene completion systems target wheeled platforms with forward-facing sensors, but legged/humanoid robots need robust 3D semantic occupancy that can handle gait-introduced body jitter and provide full 360° surround perception.

Method: Combines: (1) Dual-Projection fusion exploiting annular panorama and equirectangular unfolding; (2) Bi-Grid Voxelization in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces; (3) Lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for multi-scale fusion; (4) Gait Displacement Compensation for feature-level motion correction.

Result: Sets new SOTA on panoramic occupancy benchmarks: beats vision and LiDAR baselines on QuadOcc, gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city) on H3O. Modules are lightweight and deployable.

Conclusion: OneOcc enables robust full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots through panoramic semantic scene completion, addressing gait-induced challenges and providing deployable 360° occupancy understanding.

Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most
semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with
forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC
framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity.
OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular
panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and
grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and
cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening
free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D
for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and
(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level
motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic
occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and
Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic
occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and
popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08
(cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround
perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.

*Aniol Civit,Antonio Andriella,Carles Sierra,Guillem Alenyà*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MUP-QBAF is a multi-user personalization framework using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation to resolve conflicting preferences between multiple users in human-robot interaction, incorporating both user arguments and robot observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalization approaches in HRI focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios with multiple stakeholders having potentially conflicting preferences.

Method: Proposes Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF) that models preferences as arguments with dynamic strength recalculation based on user input and robot observations, validated through a caregiving case study.

Result: The framework successfully mediates between conflicting preferences of caregivers and care recipients during frailty assessment tasks, with sensitivity analysis showing how preference outcomes are shaped by user input and contextual observations.

Conclusion: MUP-QBAF provides a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, advancing multi-user HRI and offering a principled alternative to data-driven methods for real-world conflict navigation.

Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced
significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation,
overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially
conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user
personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference
conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically
assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates
both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,
allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.
Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose
strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's
properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic
case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting
preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment
task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base
scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and
contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and
context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work
advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to
data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world
environments.

### [58] [Manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learning for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03591)
*Qingyi Chen,Ruiqi Ni,Jun Kim,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability learning framework for decentralized multi-agent motion planning that enables robots to generate safe, task-feasible motion plans under manifold constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require robots to navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by tasks (e.g., carrying cups upright while avoiding collisions), but existing decentralized MAMP methods struggle to incorporate such constraints.

Method: Solves Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problems under manifold constraints to capture task-aware safety conditions, then integrates these into a decentralized trajectory optimization planner.

Result: The approach generalizes across diverse manifold-constrained tasks, scales to high-dimensional multi-agent manipulation problems, outperforms existing constrained motion planners, and operates at real-world speeds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables decentralized multi-agent motion planning that is both safe and task-feasible under manifold constraints without requiring assumptions about other agents' policies.

Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a
critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to
navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by
tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding
collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in
decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold
constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a
manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for
decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints
to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a
decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate
motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions
about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse
manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional
multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms
existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for
real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at

*Swadhin Agrawal,Sujoy Bhore,Joseph S. B. Mitchell,P. B. Sujit,Aayush Gohil*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the NP-hard problem of searching for intruders in orthogonal polygons using multiple robots with limited sensing, proposing space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient multi-robot search strategies for intruder detection in geometric domains, given the NP-hard nature of the problem even for stationary intruders.

Method: Proposes three algorithms: space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search, analyzing trade-offs between robot count and search time in orthogonal polygons.

Result: Developed algorithms that provide practical solutions to the intractable search problem, with evaluation of performance trade-offs based on geometric properties of the search area.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms offer efficient and robust approaches for multi-robot intruder search in geometric domains, addressing the computational complexity through practical heuristic methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by
utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal
polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a
limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile
intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,
even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our
attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods
based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.
Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the
number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the
search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected
orthogonal search area.

Method: Combines IR motion capture camera and LiDAR for precise navigation, employs unique control architecture with different regulation in tangential/normal directions for trajectory tracking, uses trajectory planning and path optimization algorithms, and features a custom paint spraying mechanism designed to work in turbulent airflow.

Result: Successfully demonstrated robustness and precision in varied conditions, capable of executing the world's largest mural painted by a drone.

Conclusion: The system expands functional applications of robotics in creative fields and shows potential for autonomous large-scale art creation.

Abstract: This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a
pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the
world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of
maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse
outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a
robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented
accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an
infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise
location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.
We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in
tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise
trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for
trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing
and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for
autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications
of robotics in creative fields.

*Azizollah Taheri,Derya Aksaray*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automata-theoretic approach for motion planning under uncertainty to achieve spatio-temporal-logical tasks specified by syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) in environments with probabilistic semantic label uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address motion planning problems with spatio-temporal-logical tasks in uncertain environments where semantic labels (e.g., region locations) are not known a priori but only available as probabilistic beliefs.

Method: Construct a special product automaton to capture semantic label uncertainty, design reward functions for each edge of this automaton, and utilize value iteration for online replanning.

Result: The approach demonstrates efficacy through theoretical results and simulations/experiments, showing it can handle motion planning with probabilistic semantic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed automata-theoretic framework successfully enables motion planning for scLTL specifications in environments with probabilistic semantic label uncertainty through online replanning with value iteration.

Abstract: This paper addresses a motion planning problem to achieve
spatio-temporal-logical tasks, expressed by syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic specifications (scLTL\next), in uncertain environments. Here,
the uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic
labels of the environment. For example, the task is "first go to region 1, then
go to region 2"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known
a priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel
automata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed
to capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is
designed for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm
utilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical
results and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach.

*Taito Tashiro,Tomoko Yonezawa,Hirotake Yamazoe*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study analyzes human motion cues in board games to design expressive robot-arm movements, finding that late-phase timing and physical embodiment are key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human motion timing behavior can inform the design of expressive robot movements, particularly in game contexts where motion cues convey information.

Method: Analyzed human piece-moving motions in Geister game (natural gameplay and instructed expressions), created phase-specific robot motions by varying speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions with physical robot vs. video presentations.

Result: Late-phase motion timing, especially during withdrawal, significantly impacts impression formation, and physical embodiment enhances the interpretability of motion cues compared to video presentations.

Conclusion: Human timing behavior provides valuable insights for designing expressive robot motions, with physical embodiment playing a crucial role in cue interpretation.

Abstract: This study investigates how human motion cues can be used to design
expressive robot-arm movements. Using the imperfect-information game Geister,
we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay
(unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based
on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement
speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two
presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results
indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays
an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances
the interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for
designing expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.

*Zhihang Qin,Yueheng Zhang,Wan Su,Linxin Hou,Shenghao Zhou,Zhijun Chen,Yu Jun Tan,Cecilia Laschi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-contained soft gripper that uses internal liquid redistribution among bistable chambers for source-free, size-selective grasping with passive stiffness adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers depend on external sources, limiting portability and long-term autonomy. This work aims to create a self-contained, source-free design for improved portability and autonomous operation.

Method: Uses three interconnected bistable snap-through chambers with internal liquid redistribution. Top sensing chamber deformation triggers snap-through expansion of grasping chambers through hydraulic feedback, enabling stable grasping without continuous energy input.

Result: The gripper achieves stable and size-selective grasping without external power sources, with passive adaptation of gripping pressure to object stiffness through internal hydraulic feedback.

Conclusion: This source-free and compact design enables lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.

Abstract: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers typically depend on external sources,
which limit portability and long-term autonomy. This work introduces a
self-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through
internal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through
chambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced
liquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling
stable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The
internal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping
pressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new
possibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in
soft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific
sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of AI control protocols shows resampling and critical action deferral improve safety from 50% to 96%, but adaptive attacks can reduce resampling safety to 17%, while critical action deferral remains robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to mitigating risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring actions and intervening when necessary.

Method: Systematically evaluate control protocols in SHADE-Arena dataset of diverse agentic environments. Test blue team protocols (deferral to trusted models, resampling, critical action deferral) against default attacks, then iterate red team strategies with additional affordances.

Result: Resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions performed best initially, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. However, adaptive red team strategies with knowledge of protocol internals reduced resampling safety to 17%, while critical action deferral remained robust.

Conclusion: Critical action deferral is highly robust to even strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals for maintaining AI safety.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

*Sina Montazeri,Yunhe Feng,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PublicAgent is a multi-agent LLM framework that decomposes data analysis workflows into specialized agents (intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, reporting) to overcome limitations of single-model approaches, with evaluation showing specialization provides value independent of model strength and enables broader public access to open data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open data repositories are inaccessible to non-experts who lack expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. While LLMs show promise for individual tasks, end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations including attention dilution, specialized reasoning interference, and undetected error propagation.

Method: PublicAgent decomposes analytical workflows into specialized agents: intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This multi-agent architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage, evaluated across five models and 50 queries.

Result: Evaluation derived five design principles: 1) Specialization provides value independent of model strength (97.5% agent win rates), 2) Agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories, 3) Agents mitigate distinct failure modes, 4) Architectural benefits persist across task complexity, 5) Wide variance in agent effectiveness requires model-aware design.

Conclusion: Multi-agent specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows, enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces while providing workflow management value that persists across different model capabilities and task complexities.

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

Conclusion: ScalingEval establishes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, providing actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical
for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present
ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36

the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a benchmark to test whether LLMs internalize real-world probability distributions across domains like economics, health, and education, finding they perform poorly and lack observational distribution knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' capabilities in learning probabilistic knowledge about real-world distributions, as current systems excel at factual knowledge but their ability to internalize distributional properties remains unclear despite claims of being universal distribution approximators.

Method: Developed the first benchmark to directly test whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across multiple domains including economics, health, education, and social behavior.

Result: LLMs perform poorly overall and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. They lack knowledge of observational distributions (Layer 1 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy).

Conclusion: Language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions, and by extension from the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, their interventional and counterfactual knowledge is also limited, challenging claims of LLMs as universal distributional learners.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

TL;DR: SnapStream is a KV cache compression method that enables 4x improved on-chip memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation, deployed in production inference systems with static graphs and continuous batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs with 100k+ context lengths require substantial on-chip memory for KV caches, but existing compression techniques like StreamingLLM and SnapKV are not widely adopted in industrial deployments due to framework constraints and unclear accuracy implications.

Method: Developed SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale with static graphs and continuous batching, tested on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1.

Result: Achieved 4x improved on-chip memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks, demonstrated in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens/second.

Conclusion: SnapStream successfully implements sparse KV attention techniques in production inference systems, addressing the memory demands of large KV caches while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

*Katherine C. Kellogg,Bingyang Ye,Yifan Hu,Guergana K. Savova,Byron Wallace,Danielle S. Bitterman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes capability-based monitoring as a new approach for monitoring large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, shifting from traditional task-based monitoring to focus on shared model capabilities like summarization, reasoning, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML monitoring approaches are task-based and assume performance degradation from dataset drift, but LLMs are generalist systems not trained for specific tasks, requiring a new monitoring paradigm that accounts for their unique characteristics.

Method: Organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities (summarization, reasoning, translation, safety guardrails) rather than individual downstream tasks, enabling cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors.

Result: Provides a scalable framework for detecting issues that task-based monitoring may miss, including systemic weaknesses across multiple applications and emergent behaviors in LLM deployment.

Conclusion: Capability-based monitoring offers a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist AI models in healthcare, with implementation considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

### [70] [miniF2F-Lean Revisited: Reviewing Limitations and Charting a Path Forward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03108)
*Azim Ospanov,Farzan Farnia,Roozbeh Yousefzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of the miniF2F benchmark reveals significant discrepancies between formal and informal math statements, leading to poor AI performance. After correcting these issues in miniF2F-v2, accuracy improved from 36% to 70%, highlighting the importance of benchmark quality for evaluating formal reasoning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why AI systems perform poorly in math Olympiad settings despite high individual performance in autoformalization and theorem proving tasks, and to identify the root causes of performance gaps in the full pipeline.

Method: Conducted thorough analysis of formal-informal statement discrepancies in miniF2F benchmark, corrected all errors and simplifications to create miniF2F-v2, then evaluated the full theorem proving pipeline (natural language comprehension → formalization → proof) using state-of-the-art models.

Result: Original miniF2F pipeline accuracy was only 36% despite 97% autoformalization and 69% theorem proving individual accuracies. After corrections in miniF2F-v2, accuracy improved to 70%, but still shows significant misalignment between autoformalization models and theorem provers.

Conclusion: Benchmark quality significantly impacts evaluation of formal reasoning systems. High-quality datasets like miniF2F-v2 are crucial for accurately assessing progress and diagnosing failure modes in autoformalization and theorem proving models.

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available
at https://github.com/roozbeh-yz/miniF2F_v2.

### [71] [Using Multi-modal Large Language Model to Boost Fireworks Algorithm's Ability in Settling Challenging Optimization Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137)
*Shipeng Cen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-modal large language models (MLLM) to enhance the fireworks algorithm (FWA) for complex optimization problems, introducing the concept of Critical Part (CP) to extend FWA to high-dimensional tasks like TSP and EDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with non-convex, high-dimensional, black-box problems due to low efficiency and inaccurate gradient information. Recent advances in LLMs' language understanding and code generation capabilities offer new opportunities for optimization algorithm design.

Method: The authors use MLLM to assist in designing FWA, introducing the Critical Part concept to extend FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks and leverage optimization process information through MLLM's multi-modal capabilities.

Result: Experimental results on traveling salesman problem and electronic design automation problem show that FWAs generated under the new framework achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results on many problem instances.

Conclusion: Incorporating MLLM into optimization algorithm design, particularly for enhancing FWA with the Critical Part concept, effectively addresses complex optimization challenges and achieves competitive performance on benchmark problems.

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel safety response framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that provides systematic protection at both input and output levels using fine-tuned classification and RAG-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security issues in LLMs are increasingly prominent and constrain their trustworthy deployment in critical domains, necessitating systematic safety measures.

Method: Input-level: supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification with 4-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention). Output-level: RAG integration with fine-tuned interpretation model for real-time trustworthy knowledge grounding.

Result: Achieved 99.3% risk recall rate, significantly higher safety scores on public benchmarks compared to TinyR1-Safety-8B baseline, and perfect 100% safety score on proprietary high-risk test set.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications with exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a validation methodology for formal XAI explainers and finds that PyXAI produces incorrect explanations on most datasets tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal XAI methods provide theoretical guarantees but lack practical validation methods for their implementations.

Method: Developed a novel validation methodology for formal explainers and tested it on the publicly available PyXAI explainer across multiple datasets.

Result: Found that PyXAI computes incorrect explanations on most of the analyzed datasets, highlighting implementation flaws.

Conclusion: The proposed validation methodology is crucial for ensuring the correctness of formal explainer implementations in practice.

Abstract: Formal explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers unique theoretical
guarantees of rigor when compared to other non-formal methods of
explainability. However, little attention has been given to the validation of
practical implementations of formal explainers. This paper develops a novel
methodology for validating formal explainers and reports on the assessment of
the publicly available formal explainer PyXAI. The paper documents the
existence of incorrect explanations computed by PyXAI on most of the datasets
analyzed in the experiments, thereby confirming the importance of the proposed
novel methodology for the validation of formal explainers.

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI framework for engineering design that uses specialized agents (Graph Ontologist, Design Engineer, Systems Engineer) to collaboratively generate and refine designs through iterative feedback loops, demonstrated with NACA airfoil optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional engineering design processes are resource-intensive and inefficient due to the need for multi-domain expertise and complex collaborations.

Method: Three-agent framework: Graph Ontologist builds domain knowledge graphs using LLMs, Systems Engineer formulates requirements, Design Engineer generates candidates, and iterative review loops with quantitative/qualitative feedback until validation.

Result: Successfully applied to aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils, with final designs optimized for performance metrics like lift-to-drag ratio.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in engineering design processes.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

*Yi-Fei Liu,Yi-Long Lu,Di He,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately model human psychological trait correlations by role-playing Big Five Personality Scale responses and generating responses to other psychological scales, achieving near-human accuracy through a systematic two-stage reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs and understand their reasoning process.

Method: Prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 individuals to role-play responses on nine other psychological scales, analyzed reasoning traces and information selection processes.

Result: LLMs achieved remarkable accuracy (R² > 0.89) in capturing human psychological structure, exceeding semantic similarity predictions and approaching trained ML algorithm performance. They use a two-stage process: transforming raw responses into personality summaries, then reasoning from these summaries.

Conclusion: LLMs can precisely predict psychological traits through abstraction and reasoning, offering powerful tools for psychological simulation and insights into emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: AAA is an AI-assisted web accessibility auditing framework that operationalizes WCAG-EM through human-AI partnership, using GRASP for representative page sampling and MaC (multimodal LLM copilot) to assist auditors with cross-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web accessibility auditing practices are resource-intensive and unscalable, with most websites remaining non-compliant despite WCAG-EM providing a structured methodology for evaluation.

Method: AAA framework with two key innovations: GRASP (graph-based multimodal sampling method using visual, textual, and relational embeddings) and MaC (multimodal LLM copilot for cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned. Four novel datasets were created for benchmarking audit pipeline stages.

Conclusion: The AAA framework enables scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing through human-AI partnership, empowering auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact on digital accessibility.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

TL;DR: Solly is the first AI agent to achieve elite human performance in multi-player Liar's Poker using deep reinforcement learning, outperforming both humans and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous AI breakthroughs in poker-like games focused on two-player scenarios, but Liar's Poker offers more extensive multi-player engagement with imperfect information and reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: Trained using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: Achieved elite human level performance (won over 50% of hands and positive equity) in both heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker, outperformed LLMs, developed novel strategies, randomized effectively, and was not easily exploitable.

Conclusion: Solly demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning can achieve elite performance in complex multi-player games with extensive engagement, advancing beyond previous poker AI achievements.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.
