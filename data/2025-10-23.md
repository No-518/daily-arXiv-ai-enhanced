<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation generates massive datasets that are crucial for addressing societal, economic, and environmental challenges, but high dimensionality causes sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, limiting machine learning effectiveness.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive review of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction methods, that reduce data complexity while preserving essential properties.

Result: The review serves as a handbook for applying DR across the remote sensing data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored DR algorithms.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for effectively handling Earth observation data and enable improved data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are stealthy fiducial markers that blend into environments using neural networks to apply subtle visual alterations, enabling 6-DoF tracking for AR and robotics while remaining visually unobtrusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fiducial markers are visually conspicuous and undesirable for aesthetic reasons in many applications, creating a need for markers that can provide reliable tracking while blending naturally into real-world environments.

Method: An encoder network applies visually modest alterations to arbitrary images to create Ninja Codes. The system uses an end-to-end process inspired by deep steganography, jointly training network modules for creation and detection. Codes can be printed on regular paper with standard color printers.

Result: Experiments show Ninja Codes provide reliable 6-DoF location tracking under common indoor lighting conditions while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures. They can be detected using any device with an RGB camera and inference capability.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes offer particular value in scenarios where conventional markers' conspicuous appearance is undesirable, providing stealthy tracking capabilities for augmented reality, robotics, and motion-based interfaces.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that uses multimodal LLMs with camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting to answer perception, prediction, and planning questions, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust question-answering system for autonomous driving that can handle high-level perception, prediction, and planning tasks by leveraging multimodal language models with contextual grounding and temporal information.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase-1 uses Qwen2.5-VL-32B conditioned on six-camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting with self-consistency ensemble; Phase-2 augments prompts with scene metadata and category-specific instructions for different driving tasks.

Result: Achieved 67.37% overall accuracy on driving QA benchmark, with Phase-1 reaching 66.85% using self-consistency and Phase-2 further improving to 67.37%. System maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can significantly enhance high-level driving question-answering with pretrained vision-language models, demonstrating the importance of systematic prompt design and temporal context integration.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a state-space model for longitudinal medical imaging that handles irregular time intervals between high-resolution images using continuous-time selective scanning and multi-scale 3D fusion, achieving superior breast cancer risk prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to fully exploit spatial and temporal cues in sequential radiological images captured at irregular intervals, either collapsing spatial information or using inefficient spatio-temporal models incompatible with non-uniform time steps.

Method: A state-space architecture with continuous-time selective scanning that integrates true time differences between exams into state transitions, complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module to capture spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: Superior performance in breast cancer risk prediction, improving validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to recurrent, transformer, and state-space model variants.

Conclusion: The model provides an efficient framework for longitudinal image analysis with linear complexity, capable of processing long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-centric alignment framework that disentangles motion features from pretrained video encoders and aligns them with text-to-video diffusion models to improve temporal coherence and physical plausibility in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex motions. Existing approaches using pretrained video encoders suffer from entangled appearance and dynamics features.

Method: Proposes learning a disentangled motion subspace from pretrained video encoders optimized to predict optical flow, then aligning diffusion model features to this motion subspace to internalize motion knowledge.

Result: Improves physical commonsense in state-of-the-art video diffusion models while preserving text adherence, validated on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0 benchmarks and user studies.

Conclusion: The motion-centric alignment framework effectively enhances motion quality in text-to-video generation by leveraging disentangled motion features from optical flow prediction.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh is a new metric for evaluating detailed image descriptions that uses scene graphs to guide LLM judges, providing interpretable scores that better match human judgments than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like CIDEr and SPICE were designed for short texts and don't handle the complexity of detailed image descriptions, lacking sensitivity to attribute/relation errors and localization of specific mistakes.

Method: PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLM judges, producing aggregate scores based on fine-grained errors in compositional understanding. The authors also introduce DOCENT, a new benchmark with expert-written references and human judgments.

Result: PoSh achieves +0.05 Spearman correlation improvement over best alternatives, works robustly across image types, and serves as an effective reward function outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Foundation models struggle with complex scene dynamics in DOCENT.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT enable better evaluation of detailed image description systems, revealing current model limitations and establishing a challenging new benchmark for VLM progress, with applications in assistive text generation.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR is a unified human pose representation learning pipeline that aligns embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in multi-modal alignment pipelines for human-centric applications, but limited research on correlating different human pose representations (images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models) using contrastive learning paradigms.

Method: Proposes UniHPR pipeline with a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align more than two data representations simultaneously, specifically aligning human pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D poses.

Result: Achieves MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW with cross-domain evaluation for 3D pose estimation. Also enables 2D and 3D pose retrieval with 9.24mm MPJPE error on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: UniHPR successfully creates unified human pose representations that enable effective cross-modal alignment and achieve remarkable performance in both pose estimation and retrieval tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed singular value-based contrastive learning approach.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard U-Net models struggle with accurately delineating brain tumor regions, especially with irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries, while also facing computational challenges and class imbalance issues when training on high-resolution MRI data like BraTS datasets.

Method: Integration of attention mechanism into 3D U-Net model to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions, combined with a tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques to address class imbalance and mitigate bias in training data.

Conclusion: The attention-enhanced 3D U-Net with tumor detection algorithm significantly improves brain tumor segmentation performance, offering valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasound breast cancer datasets for enhanced tumor segmentation while preserving patient privacy, achieving 96% accuracy with a modified U-Net model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women, requiring early detection and accurate diagnosis. Ultrasound imaging is cost-effective but faces privacy challenges with medical data. Federated Learning addresses privacy but struggles with non-IID data affecting model accuracy for tumor boundary delineation.

Method: Applied Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer imaging datasets. Incorporated a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms to enhance tumor segmentation accuracy.

Result: Achieved a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating effective tumor segmentation while preserving patient privacy.

Conclusion: FedProx shows promise as an approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets, balancing accuracy with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Ego-CS dataset with 124 hours of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay and Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) method for multi-agent tactical awareness from first-person perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports video understanding relies on third-person views and overlooks synchronous egocentric multi-agent learning. Need to model team tactics from individual players' perspectives.

Method: Proposed Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) that aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to develop team-level tactical situational awareness from individual viewpoints.

Result: CECL demonstrated effectiveness in teammate-opponent location prediction task, enhancing agents' ability to infer positions from single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL establish foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports, positioning gameplay as testbed for multi-agent modeling with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning networks are used to automatically detect malaria from blood cell images, with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet achieving over 97% accuracy, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual malaria diagnosis through microscope observation is prone to errors due to lack of expertise and manual involvement, necessitating automated computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Method: Applied six deep convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) to extract features from blood cell images and classify them as malaria-infected or healthy cells.

Result: Residual Attention Network achieved 97.28% accuracy and XceptionNet achieved 97.55% accuracy on a public malaria cell image dataset, surpassing other related methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods show strong potential for reliable automatic malaria detection while minimizing manual involvement, encouraging their real-world application.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal is a training-free method that uses adaptive KV cache pruning to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models by focusing attention on critical visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention to visual tokens, where redundant visual tokens disperse the model's attention away from critical visual cues.

Method: Proposes PruneHal, a training-free method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance focus on critical visual information without requiring additional training or incurring extra inference costs.

Result: Evaluated on several hallucination benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the method's effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PruneHal is the first token pruning approach for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, is model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric for improving temporal consistency in image-to-video generation through reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward functions focus on overall video quality but fail to address temporal consistency issues in image-to-video generation tasks, leading to incoherent video sequences.

Method: VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture temporal information through frequency-domain analysis, and used within a reward-based fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results show that fine-tuning with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency across multiple I2V datasets without degrading other performance metrics compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VCD effectively addresses temporal consistency limitations in image-to-video generation while maintaining overall video quality, providing a specialized solution for temporal coherence in video synthesis.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive is a synthetic data generation framework that uses 3D-aware guidance maps and world models to create multi-view photorealistic videos for enhancing autonomous driving perception tasks, particularly corner case detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving world models focus on generation quality but overlook downstream perception task evaluation, which is crucial for autonomous driving. Current synthetic data methods require double training epochs compared to real-only baselines, making their benefits questionable.

Method: Decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto these maps, then fine-tunes driving world models to produce edited multi-view photorealistic videos for training perception models.

Result: Enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception. Comprehensive experiments show Dream4Drive effectively boosts downstream perception model performance under various training epochs.

Conclusion: Dream4Drive provides a novel approach to synthetic data generation that genuinely enhances downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating measurable benefits without requiring excessive training epochs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: MoE-GS is a unified framework that integrates multiple specialized experts via a Volume-aware Pixel Router for dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering quality while addressing efficiency through optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, with no single approach effectively handling all dynamic challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS) with a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router that adaptively blends expert outputs through differentiable weight splatting. Includes efficiency improvements via single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and distillation to lightweight experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting, providing a unified framework that delivers superior performance across diverse dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [17] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion is a camera-4D imaging radar fusion network for 3D object detection that uses surface fitting to enhance spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, improving depth prediction and mitigating radar sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D imaging radar offers advantages for autonomous driving but suffers from sparse point clouds and low resolution, limiting geometric representation and hindering multi-modal fusion with cameras.

Method: The method estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data to create an explicit surface fitting model. This generates dense pseudo-point clouds to mitigate radar sparsity and guides image feature transformation from perspective view to bird's-eye view for multi-modal fusion using a pillar-based approach.

Result: SFGFusion achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks, effectively fusing camera and 4D radar features.

Conclusion: The surface fitting-guided approach successfully enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction between camera and 4D radar data, enabling more reliable dense depth prediction and improved 3D object detection performance.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space objects in GEO are hard to detect due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference in optical imaging.

Method: Uses wavelet transform to enhance high-frequency features and suppress background noise at single-frame level, then applies multi-frame temporal trajectory completion with Hungarian algorithm for cross-frame matching, plus post-processing with temporal matching, interpolation, noise filtering, and trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 90.14% on the public SpotGEO dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GEO object detection challenges and demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead is a collaborative perception framework that learns to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features, enabling efficient information sharing between autonomous vehicles under bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth constraints in vehicular networks make transmitting entire feature maps impractical, and existing foreground-centric methods discard essential background context that encodes important environmental information.

Method: Uses a curricular learning strategy that initially leverages background cues but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background features.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings.

Conclusion: Context-enriched foreground sharing through FadeLead's curricular learning approach effectively overcomes bandwidth limitations while maintaining essential environmental context for collaborative perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a distinctive perspective on 4D generation by focusing on representation selection and customization rather than exhaustive enumeration, addressing the fast-evolving subfield propelled by neural fields, geometric/motion deep learning, and 3D GenAI.

Method: Selective approach analyzing representative works to highlight desirable properties and challenges of different 4D representations under various scenarios, organized around three pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.

Result: Comprehensive coverage of popular representations (NeRFs, 3DGS) and under-explored ones (structured models, long-range motions), with analysis of LLMs and VFMs in 4D applications and current dataset landscape.

Conclusion: The survey provides guidance on selecting and customizing appropriate 4D representations for specific tasks, identifies current limitations in the field, and outlines what datasets are needed to advance 4D generation research.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

TL;DR: Proposes a one-step diffusion-based super-resolution framework with ControlNet for semantic edge guidance, achieving improved structural accuracy while maintaining fast inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between perceptual quality and computational cost in real-world image super-resolution, specifically tackling structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models caused by distillation artifacts.

Method: Enhances one-step diffusion model using ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance, with hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and edge-aware AME loss for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision.

Result: Effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining one-step generation efficiency, achieving superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses structural inaccuracies in fast super-resolution methods through edge guidance and hybrid loss optimization.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

TL;DR: MobiAct is a lightweight MAV action recognition framework that uses MobileNetV4 backbone with knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy (92.12%) with low energy (136.16 pJ) and fast processing (8.84 actions/sec).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV motion recognition approaches use large, computationally intensive models unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, creating a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.

Method: Uses MobileNetV4 backbone with Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) from ResNet18 teacher, parameter-free attention mechanism, and hybrid loss training strategy for stable optimization.

Result: Achieves 92.12% average accuracy across three datasets, consumes only 136.16 pJ energy, processes 8.84 actions/sec, and decodes actions 2x faster than leading methods with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: MobiAct enables low-energy, low-computation MAV action recognition with superior efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained autonomous aerial swarm applications.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: D2D transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics to improve object counting accuracy in text-to-image diffusion models without sacrificing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts, and existing approaches are limited to differentiable regression-based counting networks, excluding superior detector-based models.

Method: Proposes D2D framework that uses custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, then optimizes noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models.

Result: Substantial improvements in object counting accuracy across multiple benchmarks (up to 13.7% on D2D-Small), with minimal degradation in image quality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: D2D successfully bridges the gap between non-differentiable detection models and T2I generation, enabling superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the

ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving world models are mostly decoupled from planning, and the synergistic relationship between world modeling and planning needs further exploration to improve autonomous driving systems.

Method: PWM uses unified architecture with action-free future state forecasting, collaborative state-action prediction, dynamically enhanced parallel token generation, context-guided tokenizer, and adaptive dynamic focal loss for efficient video forecasting.

Result: The method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that use multi-view and multi-modal inputs, despite utilizing only front camera input.

Conclusion: PWM demonstrates that unified world modeling and planning with human-like anticipatory perception can achieve superior autonomous driving performance with simplified sensor inputs.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL) is an efficient training algorithm that combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning to create powerful, lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can compete with state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VLMs are impractical for resource-constrained environments, creating a need for efficient training methods to develop smaller yet powerful VLMs.

Method: RIL combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning using an LLM-based discriminator to distinguish between student and teacher outputs, with guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs for diverse learning.

Result: RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and surpasses them in several instances across diverse vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified reinforcement and imitation learning strategy enables student models to achieve significant performance gains, making lightweight VLMs competitive with leading closed-source models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant

*Hai-jie Yuan,Heng Zhang,Fei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TS-GATR is a novel dynamic signature verification method that combines Graph Attention Network and GRU to model spatial-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower EER on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten signature verification is crucial for identity authentication but faces challenges due to intra-user variability and forgery risks. Existing methods struggle with modeling complex spatial-temporal relationships in dynamic signature data.

Method: TS-GATR represents signatures as graphs with nodes capturing dynamic features (position, velocity, pressure). It uses Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) with k-step and k-nearest neighbor graphs for local/global spatial features, and integrates GRU for long-term temporal dependencies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSDS and DeepSignDB datasets show TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Conclusion: TS-GATR effectively models both spatial and temporal dependencies in dynamic signatures through graph attention mechanisms and GRU integration, demonstrating superior verification performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a unified multi-task deep learning framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery, outperforming traditional methods and single-task approaches through cross-task feature fusion and dynamic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat bathymetry estimation and seabed classification as separate tasks, missing the synergistic benefits of their interaction and hindering adoption of deep learning in shallow-water mapping.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoders for bathymetry and seabed classification, integrates features via Attention Feature Fusion module and windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting.

Result: Achieves up to 75% lower RMSE than traditional methods, reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8%, and demonstrates enhanced spatial consistency and habitat boundaries.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling depth with substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, providing a robust open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping that outperforms isolated task approaches.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

### [30] [Exploring Scale Shift in Crowd Localization under the Context of Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19330)
*Juncheng Wang,Lei Shang,Ziqi Liu,Wang Lu,Xixu Hu,Zhe Hu,Jindong Wang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates scale shift (discrepancies in head scale distributions) as a key challenge for domain generalization in crowd localization, proposes a benchmark called ScaleBench, and introduces a new algorithm called Catto to mitigate scale shift effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd localization approaches suffer from performance degradation due to scale shift between training and testing data, which remains insufficiently explored in domain generalization scenarios.

Method: The authors conduct systematic examination of scale shift effects, establish ScaleBench benchmark with 20 DG algorithms, provide theoretical analysis, and propose Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate limitations of existing algorithms and reveal four significant insights about scale shift influence, while the proposed Catto algorithm effectively mitigates scale shift effects.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of Scale Shift Domain Generalization as a novel research direction and provides valuable insights for future work in crowd localization domain generalization.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP is a parameter-efficient fMRI-to-image decoding method that aligns brain activity with multiple CLIP layers guided by visual hierarchy, eliminating the need for VAE pipelines while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI decoding methods overlook rich object information in CLIP's intermediate layers and contradict the brain's functional hierarchy by relying on parameter-intensive VAE pipelines.

Method: Multi-layer fusion approach aligning fMRI signals from different visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, with Cross-Reconstruction strategy and multi-granularity loss.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance, excels on high-level semantic metrics matching/surpassing SOTA methods, with 71.7% parameter reduction compared to VAE-based methods.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP effectively captures visual details missed by CLIP-only approaches, balancing semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring separate VAE pipeline.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and recognition using EfficientNetB0 for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP for object recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible and generalizable framework for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition without requiring training, enabling semantic region segmentation and object recognition across diverse categories.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Unsupervised segmentation using EfficientNetB0 features decomposed via SVD and clustered with hierarchical clustering, 2) Segment-level recognition using CLIP's vision-language alignment with projected embeddings in shared latent space.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC benchmarks in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework demonstrates effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: DaMo is a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures for multitask learning in Mobile Phone Agents, achieving 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench and superior generalization across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously, and existing multitask SFT approaches cannot determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance.

Method: Proposed DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. Also introduced PhoneAgentBench, a specialized benchmark with 1235 QA pairs for multimodal mobile phone tasks.

Result: DaMo achieved strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81), 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench, 2.57% average improvement across established benchmarks, and 12.47% improvement on BFCL-v3 task. Maintains robust scalability across model architectures.

Conclusion: DaMo effectively addresses the data mixture optimization challenge for multitask learning in Mobile Phone Agents, demonstrating superior performance, generalization, and scalability compared to alternative methods.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based registration methods often overlook regularization's critical role in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility, leading to non-physical artifacts and instability.

Method: Proposes DARE framework with dynamic elastic regularization adjustment based on deformation field gradient norm, integrating strain and shear energy terms with adaptive modulation and folding-prevention mechanism using negative Jacobian penalization.

Result: The approach mitigates non-physical artifacts like folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: DARE provides a robust registration framework that balances stability and flexibility while ensuring physically realistic transformations through adaptive regularization and folding prevention.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF is a framework that protects Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) intellectual property by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt unauthorized downstream applications while preserving rendering quality through adaptive geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As NeRFs become powerful tools for 3D scene representation, protecting their intellectual property from unauthorized use is crucial. Existing methods avoid geometric perturbations due to quality degradation concerns.

Method: Proposes AegisRF with two components: Perturbation Field that injects adversarial perturbations into pre-rendering outputs to fool unauthorized models, and Sensitivity Field that learns spatially varying sensitivity to constrain geometric perturbations while maintaining visual quality.

Result: Experimental evaluations show generalized applicability across diverse downstream tasks (multi-view image classification, voxel-based 3D localization) while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AegisRF effectively protects NeRF IP by disrupting unauthorized applications through adaptive adversarial perturbations that preserve rendering quality, demonstrating broad applicability across different tasks and modalities.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning in vision-language models for robotic manipulation, showing current VLMs perform far below human levels despite strong single-view capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations focus on single-view settings, while multi-camera setups are standard in robotics. The ability of VLMs to leverage multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning remains unexplored.

Method: Created MV-RoboBench with 1.7k manually curated QA items across 8 subtasks in spatial understanding and robotic execution categories. Evaluated diverse VLMs including open-source, closed-source, and CoT-enhanced versions.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform far below human levels. Found positive correlation between spatial intelligence and robotic task execution, and that strong single-view spatial performance doesn't translate to multi-view robotic tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs face substantial challenges in multi-view robotic perception. The benchmark is released as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-camera system using 19 wide-angle cameras to track warehouse workers by aligning positions based on foot positions, improving tracking accuracy by over 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With e-commerce growth, improving warehouse operation efficiency is essential. Digital twins require accurate worker position tracking, but single cameras have limited field of view, necessitating multiple camera systems.

Method: Used 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras looking down at warehouse floor. Addressed wide-angle camera distortion by aligning detected worker positions based on foot positions rather than full-body coordinates.

Result: Achieved over 20% improvement in tracking accuracy by reducing effects of image distortion through foot position-based alignment across multiple cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed foot position-based alignment method effectively addresses wide-angle camera distortion and enables accurate multi-camera worker tracking in warehouse environments.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: PICK is a multi-step framework using MLLMs for psychoanalytical image comprehension, specifically for the House-Tree-Person psychological test, achieving expert-level reasoning through hierarchical analysis and knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at objective multimodal tasks but lack application in subjective, emotionally nuanced domains like psychological analysis, particularly for clinical assessments like the HTP test.

Method: Decomposes drawings into hierarchical sub-drawings (single-object, multi-object, whole levels), analyzes visual cues for psychological insights, uses HTP knowledge base with reinforcement learning-trained feature extraction to generate psychological profiles, and integrates multi-faceted information.

Result: PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' capability in psychological analysis and is validated as a general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The framework bridges MLLMs with specialized expert domains, providing a structured and interpretable approach for understanding human mental states through visual expression.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight preprocessing module that predicts the minimal sufficient image resolution for VLMs, reducing compute by up to 80% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images in VLMs inflate visual tokens to 97-99% of total tokens, causing high compute and latency even when low-resolution images would suffice.

Method: Uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target VLM's response converges to its peak ability, trained as discrete classifier but interpolates continuous resolutions at inference.

Result: Across five multimodal benchmarks and diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: CARES effectively reduces computational overhead in VLMs by intelligently selecting minimal sufficient image resolutions without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Hao-Chiang Shao,Chun-Hao Chang,Yu-Hsien Lin,Chia-Wen Lin,Shao-Yun Fang,Yan-Hsiu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IC-Defect-14, a highly imbalanced IC defect dataset with unique intra-class clusters, and proposes ReCAME-Net to address the challenges of large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity in real-world IC defect classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces two main challenges: extreme data imbalance due to high yield-rate requirements, and complex feature mixing of class-specific and domain-related attributes. Existing classifiers for general imbalanced datasets fail in these real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed ReCAME-Net, a multi-expert classifier framework that integrates regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, hard category mining strategy, and knowledge distillation procedure.

Result: ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of real-world IC defect classification with highly imbalanced data and complex intra-class clustering characteristics.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

### [41] [A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559)
*Nidham Tekaya,Manuela Waldner,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the temporal awareness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, revealing that temporal information forms a low-dimensional manifold in embedding spaces, and proposes methods to extract explicit timeline representations for temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' ability to position visual content in time and leverage their temporal awareness for improved temporal reasoning tasks, given their generalizable multimodal representations from large-scale training.

Method: Introduced TIME10k benchmark dataset with 10,000+ images with temporal ground truth, evaluated 37 VLMs using novel methodology, and developed methods to extract explicit timeline representations from embedding spaces based on discovered temporal manifolds.

Result: Discovered temporal information is structured along low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds in VLM embedding spaces. Timeline representations achieved competitive to superior accuracy compared to prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: VLMs possess inherent temporal awareness that can be explicitly modeled as timelines, enabling effective temporal reasoning. The proposed timeline approaches provide efficient and accurate methods for temporal positioning of visual content.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

*Ali Sadeghkhani,Brandon Bennett,Masoud Babaei,Arash Rabbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN framework generates representative pore-scale images with controlled porosity and depth properties, solving representativeness and data scarcity challenges in subsurface characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental challenge of obtaining representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation properties, compounded by data scarcity at sparse well locations.

Method: Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on thin section samples from carbonate formation, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a unified model.

Result: Achieved exceptional porosity control (R²=0.95) with MAE 0.0099-0.0197, preserved critical pore network characteristics, and demonstrated superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% vs 36.4-578% for real sub-images.

Conclusion: Provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications where representative pore morphology is critical for digital rock physics.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

*Francisco Mena,Dino Ienco,Cassio F. Dantas,Roberto Interdonato,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that improves single-modality predictions by learning modality-shared and modality-specific representations, achieving state-of-the-art results across various EO tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation generates vast multi-modal data, but real-world constraints often limit access to all sensor modalities during inference. Current approaches are task-specific or modality-specific, lacking generalization across different EO applications.

Method: Combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning to structure model representations into modality-shared and modality-specific information, enabling generalization across tasks without targeting specific inference modalities.

Result: Demonstrates consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art methods on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks, validating effectiveness in single-modality inference scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of limited modality access during inference in EO applications, providing a generalized solution that outperforms existing approaches across diverse tasks and sensor modalities.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

### [44] [Predicting before Reconstruction: A generative prior framework for MRI acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19472)
*Juhyung Park,Rokgi Hong,Roh-Eul Yoo,Jaehyeon Koo,Se Young Chun,Seung Hong Choi,Jongho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel MRI acceleration framework that shifts from image reconstruction to predictive imaging by using generative AI to predict target contrast images as data-driven priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput, and traditional reconstruction methods are insufficient for high acceleration factors. The paper aims to leverage generative AI capabilities to create a paradigm shift from reactive reconstruction to proactive predictive imaging.

Method: A generative model predicts target contrast images conditioned on diverse data sources (other contrast images, previously scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information), which then serve as informative priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled k-space data. Demonstrated with FLAIR reconstruction from T1w/T2w scans and T1w reconstruction from previous T1w scans.

Result: Evaluated on 14,921 scans (1,051,904 slices) across internal and multiple public datasets with multi-channel k-space data. The prediction-prior reconstruction method significantly outperformed other approaches at high acceleration factors (x4, x8, x12), including methods with alternative or no prior information.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a fundamental shift from image reconstruction to a new paradigm of predictive imaging, demonstrating superior performance for MRI acceleration through generative AI-powered prediction priors.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents XBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style vision-language models. It reveals that while VLMs show reasonable localization for large pathologies, performance degrades for small lesions, and models trained on medical data outperform general-domain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in medical imaging but their grounding ability (alignment between textual concepts and visual evidence) remains underexplored, which is essential for clinical interpretability and adoption.

Method: Generated visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assessed their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies using seven CLIP-style VLM variants.

Result: (1) All VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large/well-defined pathologies but performance substantially degrades for small/diffuse lesions; (2) Models pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets show improved alignment; (3) Recognition ability and grounding ability are strongly correlated.

Conclusion: Current VLMs, despite strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [46] [PRGCN: A Graph Memory Network for Cross-Sequence Pattern Reuse in 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19475)
*Zhuoyang Xie,Yibo Zhao,Hui Huang,Riwei Wang,Zan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRGCN introduces a pattern reuse framework for monocular 3D human pose estimation that learns pose prototypes across sequences and retrieves them via attention to provide structured priors, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods process sequences in isolation, failing to exploit structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns across sequences in human movement.

Method: PRGCN uses a graph memory bank storing pose prototypes encoded as relational graphs, retrieved via attention and fused with anatomical constraints through memory-driven graph convolution. It employs a dual-stream hybrid architecture combining Mamba-based state-space models with self-attention.

Result: Achieved MPJPE of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP, establishing new state-of-the-art with enhanced cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal for advancing 3D human pose estimation, shifting from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses representation bias in methane plume detection from satellite images caused by systematically missing pixels (MNAR). It proposes imputation and weighted resampling methods to remove spurious associations between image coverage and labels, improving detection in low-coverage images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite images often have missing pixels due to clouds, creating MNAR data that causes representation bias in automated feature extraction models. This leads to spurious associations between label (plume detection) and image coverage, resulting in under-detection of plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: Evaluated multiple imputation approaches and proposed a weighted resampling scheme during training that enforces class balance in each coverage bin to remove the association between labels and coverage.

Result: Both resampling and imputation significantly reduced representation bias without compromising balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models showed higher detection rates for plumes in low-coverage images in operational scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing techniques effectively mitigate representation bias caused by MNAR data in satellite imagery, improving methane plume detection performance particularly in challenging low-coverage conditions.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

*John Burden,Jonathan Prunty,Ben Slater,Matthieu Tehenan,Greg Davis,Lucy Cheke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology to test whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit human-like "pop-out" effects and capacity limits in visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs achieve strong performance on vision-language tasks, their visual processing mechanisms remain opaque. The authors want to understand if MLLMs exhibit fundamental perceptual phenomena like humans do.

Method: The researchers adapted classic visual search paradigms to test MLLMs on color, size, and lighting features. They conducted controlled experiments for disjunctive (single feature) and conjunctive (multiple feature) search tasks, and used targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses.

Result: Advanced MLLMs exhibited human-like pop-out effects for color and size-based disjunctive search, showed capacity limits for conjunctive search, and incorporated natural scene priors like lighting direction into object representations.

Conclusion: Visual search serves as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs, revealing that they exhibit some fundamental human-like visual processing mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

TL;DR: Cauvis method addresses spurious correlation issues in single-source domain generalized object detection by using visual prompts and cross-attention to disentangle causal features from spurious ones, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDGOD methods using data augmentation fall into spurious correlations, causing models to rely on simplistic features like color rather than domain-invariant representations like object contours.

Method: Proposes Cauvis with Cross-Attention Prompts module to mitigate bias from spurious features, and a dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, with significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively addresses the critical challenge of spurious correlations in single-source domain generalization by disentangling causal features from spurious ones through visual prompts and cross-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter improves camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs using hybrid video generation and feature matching selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap, and current approaches using video interpolation produce blurry frames with inefficient selection strategies.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) combining video interpolation with pose-conditioned novel view synthesis, and Feature Matching Selector (FMS) for optimal frame selection.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show PoseCrafter significantly enhances pose estimation performance, especially for small or no overlap cases.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter effectively addresses the challenge of pairwise camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs through improved intermediate frame generation and selection.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual reasoning tasks like counting objects due to sensitivity to object properties and spatial arrangements. Fine-tuning just the output layer can improve accuracy by up to 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models have limitations in visual reasoning tasks such as identifying relations, understanding temporal sequences, and counting objects, despite their competitive performance on downstream tasks.

Method: Studied reasoning skills of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs in counting tasks under controlled conditions, conducted layer-wise analysis, and performed targeted training by fine-tuning only the output layer.

Result: VLMs are highly sensitive to object count, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Layer-wise analysis revealed errors occur in mapping last-layer representations to output space. Fine-tuning just the output layer improved accuracy by up to 21%, with consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted fine-tuning of the output layer significantly enhances VLM performance in counting tasks, addressing fundamental limitations in visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [52] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how prompt complexity affects synthetic data quality from text-to-image models, finding that increased complexity reduces diversity but improves distribution alignment with real data, and that prompt expansion achieves the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While text-to-image models offer limitless synthetic data potential, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on data utility (quality, diversity, consistency) remains underexplored despite prompt engineering being the primary interaction method.

Method: Conducted synthetic experiments to motivate generalization difficulty, introduced a new evaluation framework comparing real vs. synthetic data utility, and performed large-scale analysis across CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI datasets using various inference-time interventions.

Result: Increasing prompt complexity reduces conditional diversity and prompt consistency but decreases synthetic-to-real distribution shift. Prompt expansion consistently achieves highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even surpassing real data.

Conclusion: Generalizing to more general conditions is harder due to diffusion models not learning required likelihood estimation. Current interventions can augment diversity but move outside real data support, with prompt expansion emerging as the most effective method.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAD is a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras to enhance object tracking in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB and event cameras have complementary strengths but suffer from significant spatio-temporal asymmetry due to different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration for object tracking.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) with hierarchical alignment strategy to minimize information loss while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments show HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: HAD successfully addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras, providing superior object tracking performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

*Ariana Yi,Ce Zhou,Liyang Xiao,Qiben Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: α-Cloak is the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors using the alpha channel of RGBA videos, achieving 100% attack success rate without model access or visible artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles, but adversarial attacks in the video domain, especially no-box settings, remain largely unexplored.

Method: Exploits alpha channel to fuse malicious target video with benign video, creating fused videos that appear normal to humans but fool object detectors. No model architecture, parameters, or outputs access required.

Result: 100% attack success rate across five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, with no perceptible artifacts.

Conclusion: Reveals previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting urgent need for defenses considering alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

*Junhong Lin,Kangli Wang,Shunzhou Wang,Songlin Fan,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGD is a feed-forward framework for surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction that addresses the challenge of maintaining geometric consistency while improving novel view quality by explicitly learning geometric information and using it to guide semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction struggle with geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views due to minimal overlap regions between views. The paper aims to ensure generalization while elevating novel view quality.

Method: Proposes Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD) framework with: 1) Lightweight VGGT variant for geometric estimation, 2) Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, 3) Semantic refinement model supervised by multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show VGD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, validating its scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Conclusion: VGD successfully addresses the tension between generalization and novel view quality in surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction by explicitly learning geometric information and using it to guide semantic refinement, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecAF is a training-free method that converts MLLM attention maps into video segmentation masks using decomposed attention fusion and SAM2 prompting, achieving performance comparable to training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable video reasoning segmentation without retraining MLLMs by refining noisy attention maps that are poorly aligned with object regions.

Method: Proposes Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF) with contrastive object-background fusion and complementary video-frame fusion, plus attention-guided SAM2 prompting for fine-grained masks.

Result: Outperforms training-free methods and achieves comparable performance to training-based methods on referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DecAF enables effective video reasoning segmentation without retraining MLLMs, demonstrating the potential of attention-based approaches for localization tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Image Forgery Localization that generates multiple diverse localization maps instead of a single deterministic one, addressing uncertainty in tampered regions through Bernoulli noise and Time-Step Cross-Attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFL methods produce single deterministic localization maps that lack precision and reliability for high-stakes applications like forensic analysis and security surveillance. There's a need to enhance prediction credibility and mitigate error risks by addressing the inherent uncertainty and variability in tampered regions.

Method: CBDiff uses a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model that generates multiple diverse localization maps. It incorporates Bernoulli noise to reflect the binary and sparse properties of forgery masks, and introduces Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention) to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps for improved manipulation detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CBDiff shows strong potential for real-world deployment by providing more credible and comprehensive forgery localization through its multi-map generation approach and specialized diffusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

### [61] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a denoising estimator using scattering coefficients that achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz exponents α≤2, bridging harmonic analysis with deep convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse estimators in frames (wavelets, curvelets) are suboptimal for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz regularity. Deep networks perform better but lack theoretical understanding. Scattering coefficients offer a simplified model to bridge this gap.

Method: Jointly minimize and maximize ℓ¹ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients, which are computed by applying a second wavelet transform to the modulus of wavelet coefficients.

Result: The estimator reaches minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images across all Lipschitz exponents α≤2, with numerical evidence supporting this performance.

Conclusion: This approach provides a new harmonic analysis method for denoising that captures geometric regularity and creates a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and deep convolutional networks.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm is a novel Generative Communication mechanism that enables seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation without retraining, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameters when adding new agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent collaboration approaches fail in heterogeneous settings due to intrusive retraining that disrupts semantic consistency and high computational costs when accommodating new agents, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses a Generative Communication mechanism with Deformable Message Extractor to extract spatial messages, Spatial-Aware Feature Generator with conditional diffusion model to generate aligned features, and Channel Enhancer for feature refinement before fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

Conclusion: GenComm enables efficient and scalable heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration through lightweight feature generation without disrupting existing semantic consistency.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR is a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework that addresses data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and fine-grained semantic discrimination issues in video moment retrieval through a two-stage training approach with curriculum learning and cross-stage distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three critical bottlenecks in existing Moment Retrieval methods: (1) data scarcity forcing shallow keyword-feature associations, (2) boundary ambiguity in transition regions between events, and (3) insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics.

Method: A two-stage training framework with cold-start and distillation adaptation. Cold-start uses curriculum learning on augmented data for foundational boundary/semantic awareness. Distillation stage employs dual query sets (Original Queries for DETR-based localization and Active Queries for dynamic adaptation) with cross-stage distillation loss to maintain consistency.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AMR effectively resolves boundary ambiguity and semantic confusion without additional data, preserves enhanced discriminative capabilities, and enables real-world generalization while preventing knowledge forgetting.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs perform poorly in medical imaging due to lack of specialized datasets and neglect of diagnostic processes that progress from coarse to fine-grained analysis.

Method: Created CT-RATE-VQA dataset (84K QA pairs) and developed MedReason-R1 with explicit reasoning process, embedding zoom-in disease ROI areas into images, and using GRPO reinforcement learning framework.

Result: MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while maintaining generalization capabilities, outperforming recent general-purpose and medical VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses medical imaging challenges by incorporating explicit reasoning processes and disease-specific details, enabling accurate diagnosis without expensive manual annotations.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS addresses over-reconstruction artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing importance-aware densification and adaptive parameter perturbations to reactivate frozen primitives in complex regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts like local blurring and needle-shape distortions, caused by gradient magnitude dilution and primitive frozen phenomenon where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited.

Method: ReAct-GS uses: (1) importance-aware densification criterion incorporating α-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to reactivate stalled primitive growth, and (2) reactivation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details.

Conclusion: The reactivation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with other 3D-GS variants, demonstrating broad applicability for improving 3D reconstruction quality in complex scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

TL;DR: CST is a framework that preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired image-to-image translation in medical imaging by integrating structure consistency through a curvilinear extraction module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image translation methods often distort fine curvilinear structures like microvasculature, which is critical in medical imaging where subtle morphological changes have significant clinical meaning.

Method: CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods like CycleGAN and UNSB.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across three medical imaging modalities shows CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance while preserving curvilinear structures.

Conclusion: CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging by reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ensemble-CAM, a novel technique for providing visual explanations to improve transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presentation attacks using fake biometric data pose critical security threats, and while deep learning models are effective for detection, they function as black boxes with opaque decisions. Explainability techniques are needed to understand model behavior and identify key regions that determine real vs fake biometric images.

Method: Developed Ensemble-CAM, a novel technique for generating visual explanations of decisions made by deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems.

Result: The proposed Ensemble-CAM technique provides visual explanations that help understand the behavior of DL-based face PAD systems, identifying key regions that influence decisions about real vs fake biometric images.

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM enhances transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems by providing visual explanations that make model decisions more interpretable and understandable to users.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework that extracts interpretable dynamical variables from videos by using spatio-temporal attention to focus on relevant regions and stability constraints to ensure robust latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting true dynamical variables from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors like background motion, occlusions, and texture changes that obscure the underlying dynamics.

Method: Phase 1: Uses a TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions. Phase 2: Probes latent space, selects meaningful dimensions via linear correlation, and refines transition dynamics with Lyapunov-based stability regularizer for contraction and reduced error accumulation.

Result: Achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers lowest analytical mean squared error compared to CNN-based and transformer-only baselines across five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world systems.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are both accurate and physically interpretable for extracting dynamical variables from video data.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

*Shaohang Jia,Zhiyong Huang,Zhi Yu,Mingyang Hou,Shuai Miao,Han Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQ is a mixed-precision quantization framework that addresses non-uniform activation distributions and static weight codebooks through adaptive weight quantization with quantile-based initialization, EMA-based codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods face challenges with highly non-uniform activation distributions and static, mismatched weight quantization codebooks that don't adapt to distributional shifts during training.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) with three key innovations: 1) quantile-based initialization for codebook alignment, 2) EMA-based online codebook adaptation to track distribution shifts, 3) sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation, plus hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping for activations.

Result: On ImageNet, ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18 with average 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies on CIFAR-10 validate individual component contributions.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively addresses key quantization challenges through adaptive distribution-aware techniques, demonstrating superior performance in low-bit quantization scenarios.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X is a multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation using an autoregressive diffusion transformer. It supports diverse tasks like text-to-motion, music-to-dance, and speech-to-gesture, with enhanced consistency through reference motion conditioning and progressive training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a unified framework that can handle diverse multimodal motion generation tasks while maintaining realistic animations with consistent content, style, and temporal dynamics.

Method: Uses an autoregressive diffusion transformer in sequence-to-sequence manner; introduces reference motion as conditioning signal; employs progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy; constructs OmniMoCap-X dataset with 28 MoCap sources standardized to SMPL-X format; uses GPT-4o for automatic hierarchical captioning.

Result: Significantly surpasses existing methods with state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks; enables interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X provides a versatile and effective solution for multimodal human motion generation, demonstrating superior performance through its unified framework, novel conditioning approach, and comprehensive dataset construction.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPL-NC is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that addresses prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between similar classes through class-aware prototype caching and negative contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer performance drops when deployment distributions diverge from training data, and existing test-time adaptation methods fail to address prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes.

Method: CPL-NC introduces a Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with rejuvenation for inactive classes, plus a Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism that constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability.

Result: Experiments on 15 benchmarks show CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior test-time adaptation methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances vision-language model generalization under distribution shifts by addressing key challenges of prototype degradation and class confusion through class-aware prototype learning and negative contrastive optimization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking next-generation text-guided image editing models by providing large-scale, high-quality, task-rich resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided

TL;DR: This paper analyzes evaluation metrics for monocular depth estimation, revealing their limitations in detecting curvature perturbations and proposing a new metric based on relative surface normals to better align with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standardization in evaluating monocular depth estimation, with existing metrics having poorly understood trade-offs and behaviors, particularly their sensitivity to different types of ground truth perturbations.

Method: The authors conduct a quantitative analysis of existing metrics' sensitivity to ground truth perturbations, compare them to human judgment, and introduce a new metric based on relative surface normals along with visualization tools and a method for creating composite metrics.

Result: The analysis reveals that existing metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbations (like making flat surfaces wavy), highlighting a significant gap in current evaluation approaches.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a new relative surface normals-based metric and composite metric creation method that better aligns with human judgment, addressing the identified limitations in existing evaluation approaches for monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point tracking benchmarks don't adequately capture real-world challenges like complex motion patterns, occlusions, and object diversity, making it difficult to properly evaluate and improve tracking algorithms.

Method: Created ITTO benchmark using videos from existing datasets and egocentric recordings, with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline. Analyzed state-of-the-art tracking methods on this benchmark.

Result: Existing trackers struggle significantly with ITTO's challenges, particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, revealing critical failure modes in current approaches.

videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes test-time scaling with verification in LLMs, framing it as a transport problem that reveals three regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve: transport, policy improvement, and saturation regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexplored role of verifiers and their imperfections in test-time scaling, and to develop a unified framework quantifying the interplay between generator coverage, verifier's region of convergence, and sampling algorithm sub-optimality.

Method: Framed verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem, proposed and analyzed sequential and batched sampling algorithms, and conducted empirical experiments with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models.

Result: Identified three distinct regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve: transport regime (sub-optimality increases with coverage), policy improvement regime (sub-optimality may decrease with coverage depending on verifier's ROC), and saturation regime (sub-optimality plateaus).

Conclusion: The transport framework successfully characterizes the geometric interplay between coverage, region of convergence, and sub-optimality, with empirical results supporting the theoretical findings across multiple LLM architectures.

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED is a clinical diagnostic framework that combines Bayesian Experimental Design with LLMs to optimize test selection, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and improve resource efficiency while keeping clinicians in the loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for clinical diagnosis rely on static datasets and fail to capture the sequential, resource-aware reasoning used by clinicians in practice, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings.

Method: Integrates Bayesian Experimental Design with large language models to select tests that maximize reduction in diagnostic uncertainty at each step, using LLMs as flexible simulators for patient state distributions and belief updates without requiring structured training data.

Result: ACTMED optimizes test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework represents progress toward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced need for domain-specific data.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM is a method that mitigates reward hacking in preference-based reward models by learning group-invariant kernels to reduce dependency on shortcuts like response verbosity and sycophancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based reward models in RLHF are prone to reward hacking and poor generalization due to over-optimization, where models exploit spurious features (shortcuts) rather than genuinely learning intended objectives.

Method: Proposed PRISM (Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps using a closed-form learning objective inspired by invariant theory in the kernel perspective.

Result: Experimental results show PRISM consistently improves reward model accuracy on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces shortcut dependency in downstream policy models.

Conclusion: PRISM establishes a robust framework for preference-based alignment by effectively mitigating shortcut behaviors in reward learning.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Conclusion: The MUSE Benchmark provides a critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving development of more robust AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini

severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

### [81] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of Early Exit in reasoning models, where both aim to reduce computational overhead but differ in decision timing. Mode Selection requires deciding between Long-CoT or Short-CoT at the beginning without explicit reasoning, while Early Exit determines stopping points during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overthinking problem in reasoning models that leads to unnecessary computational overhead, by exploring Mode Selection and Early Exit methods to optimize reasoning efficiency.

Method: The study compares nine baseline approaches for Mode Selection, examining prompt-based methods and approaches leveraging internal model information. Mode Selection is analyzed as requiring zero-step thinking decisions at the start of reasoning.

Result: Prompt-based approaches often fail due to limited classification capabilities with minimal hand-crafted information. Approaches using internal information perform better but still exhibit stability issues. Existing methods relying solely on model information are insufficient for effective Mode Selection in limited-information scenarios.

Conclusion: Mode Selection presents significant challenges as a harder variant of Early Exit, requiring decisions at the beginning of reasoning without explicit thinking. Current methods are inadequate for this task, highlighting the need for improved approaches to handle limited-information scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

*Yaoyao Qian,Yuanli Wang,Jinda Zhang,Yun Zong,Meixu Chen,Hanhan Zhou,Jindan Huang,Yifan Zeng,Xinyu Hu,Chan Hee Song,Danqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebGraphEval is a framework that converts web agent trajectories into weighted action graphs for multi-path evaluation, capturing structural diversity beyond binary success metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent evaluation relies on binary success metrics or single reference trajectories, ignoring the structural diversity in benchmark datasets.

Method: Abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into unified weighted action graphs, canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics.

Result: Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics.

Conclusion: By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatGPT underperforms compared to regex in legal text analysis, revealing limitations in assembling knowledge and reasoning for comprehensive solutions in legal domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate ChatGPT's performance in legal domain tasks, particularly extracting principles of law from legal decisions, and compare it against regex baseline rather than just human performance.

Method: Conducted an experiment comparing ChatGPT's performance with regular expressions (Regex) in extracting key passages and principles of law from legal decisions.

Result: ChatGPT was unable to assemble necessary knowledge and competencies to provide exhaustive results, performing worse than regex in legal text analysis tasks.

Conclusion: ChatGPT has major limitations in legal domain due to lack of comprehensive understanding and reasoning abilities. Genuine intelligence remains uniquely human in this field.

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

*Wachara Fungwacharakorn,Gauvain Bourgne,Ken Satoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to provide argumentative explanations for reasoning with inconsistent precedents in the generalized reason model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional case-based reasoning assumes consistent precedents, but real-world legal reasoning often involves inconsistent precedents. While a generalized reason model exists to handle inconsistent precedents, no argumentative explanation methods have been developed for this framework.

Method: The authors extend the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to accommodate the generalized notion of the reason model that handles inconsistent precedents.

Result: The paper develops an argumentative explanation approach that can explain reasoning processes when dealing with inconsistent precedents in legal case-based reasoning.

Conclusion: This work fills an important gap by providing argumentative explanation capabilities for the generalized reason model, enabling better understanding and transparency in legal AI systems that must handle inconsistent precedents.

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

*Philipp J. Schneider,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents can reproduce human-like social dynamics through behavioral reward functions and in-context learning, forming emergent network structures that mirror real online communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLM agents can replicate complex human social dynamics like homophily, reciprocity, and social validation, and identify the memory and learning mechanisms that enable such behavior.

Method: Multi-agent LLM simulation framework with repeated interactions, mutual evaluation, and behavior adaptation through in-context learning accelerated by coaching signals. Behavioral reward functions capture core drivers of online engagement.

Result: Coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, creating network structures that mirror properties of real online communities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled testbed for studying collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents can approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

*Jinwu Hu,Zihao Lian,Zhiquan Wen,Chenghao Li,Guohao Chen,Xutao Wen,Bin Xiao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CKA-RL is a Continual Reinforcement Learning method that addresses catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization through Continual Knowledge Adaptation and Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt. Existing Continual RL methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization across tasks.

Method: Proposes Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy with task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamic historical knowledge usage, plus Adaptive Knowledge Merging to combine similar vectors for scalability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks with 4.20% overall performance improvement and 8.02% forward transfer improvement.

Conclusion: CKA-RL effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating multi-hop tool orchestration by LLM agents in hierarchical MCP ecosystems, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that evaluate tools in isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges like functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments of agent capabilities.

Method: Constructs ground truth through 'equal function sets' and uses objective metrics like F1 score, organized as a five-level curriculum testing capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning and robustness.

Result: Experiments show rigid hierarchies hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness.

Conclusion: MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose limitations and guide development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents, with publicly available benchmark resources.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr is a neurosymbolic proceduralization framework that compiles symbolic plans into composable procedures for LMs, enabling efficient embodied reasoning in resource-constrained environments without external symbolic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable language models to perform embodied tasks in dynamic environments where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations.

Method: Task-specific plans are first generated by a symbolic tool, then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode implicit production rules, allowing composed procedures to be integrated into LM inference.

Result: NeSyPr demonstrates efficient reasoning capabilities on embodied benchmarks (PDDLGym, VirtualHome, ALFWorld) over large-scale reasoning models and symbolic planners, while using more compact LMs.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts multi-step symbolic reasoning into single-step LM inference, supporting efficient test-time inference without external symbolic guidance, making it suitable for latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems.

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning) is a novel method that addresses instruction ambiguity in language-conditioned tasks through distributional policy and semantic alignment components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language instructions are inherently ambiguous, which severely degrades performance in language-conditioned tasks for intelligent agents.

Method: DAIL consists of two key components: distributional policy (using value distribution estimation to enhance task differentiability) and semantic alignment (capturing correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions).

Result: Extensive experiments on structured and visual observation benchmarks show DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities and achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DAIL successfully addresses the challenge of instruction ambiguity in language-conditioned tasks through its distributional alignment approach.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp is a new benchmark for evaluating deep search agents on hierarchical rule application using real-world e-commerce data to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Codes from product descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks overlook the critical capability of applying complex rules with vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, which is essential for real-world applications like legal clauses, medical manuals, and tariff rules.

Method: Built from real-world e-commerce platform data, HSCodeComp contains 632 product entries with expert-annotated HSCodes. It evaluates agents' ability to navigate hierarchical rules to predict 10-digit codes from noisy product descriptions.

Result: Best performing agents achieve only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human expert performance of 95.0%. Test-time scaling fails to improve performance, highlighting the challenge of hierarchical rule application.

Conclusion: There is a significant performance gap between current agents and human experts in hierarchical rule application, indicating this remains a challenging frontier for AI systems that requires further research and development.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

TL;DR: AgentSense is a training-free framework that integrates LLMs into participatory urban sensing using a multi-agent system to adaptively assign sensing tasks and provide natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban sensing systems have limited generalization across diverse scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making, hindering effective urban management.

Method: Hybrid framework combining classical planners with multi-agent LLM system that iteratively refines baseline solutions to adapt to dynamic urban conditions and worker preferences while generating explanations.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in adaptivity and explainability across large-scale mobility datasets and various dynamic disturbances, with better performance and robustness than single-agent LLM baselines.

Conclusion: AgentSense represents a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

*Matthew Keating,Michael Casey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based engine that generates chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students by modeling chord progressions as weighted graphs and finding optimal paths through arpeggio transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chord tone soloing is a fundamental but difficult jazz improvisation technique where players use only notes from the current chord. This system aims to help guitar students learn and practice this essential skill.

Method: Generate chord-tone arpeggios, construct a weighted graph where nodes represent arpeggios for each chord, calculate edge weights based on optimal transition tones, find shortest path through the graph, and reconstruct soloing lines.

Result: Developed a complete engine that can generate chord tone soloing suggestions by analyzing chord progressions and finding optimal note transitions between chords.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach provides an effective method for generating chord tone soloing suggestions, with a user-friendly system designed to help guitar students practice this fundamental jazz improvisation technique.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an explainable win prediction system for e-sports that uses streaming data analysis with sliding windows to track game changes, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of e-sports and cloud computing has created demand for better analytics. Traditional AI solutions focus on batch classification and lack visualization, while streaming data analysis with explainability is needed for real-time decision-making.

Method: Developed an explainable win prediction classification system that processes input data through multiple sliding windows to capture relevant game changes in streaming scenarios.

Result: Experimental results showed accuracy higher than 90%, outperforming competing solutions in the literature.

Conclusion: The system can be integrated into ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, with the explainability module building trust in prediction outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn weighted rules through generation, logistic regression, iterative refinement, and evaluation, showing that direct rule application outperforms LLM prompting for probabilistic integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can propose rules in natural language but often ignore rule interactions and lack robust probabilistic inference, creating an opportunity to combine LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) LLM generates and filters rule candidates, (2) logistic regression learns probabilistic weights, (3) iterative refinement updates rules using prediction errors, (4) evaluation compares direct rule application vs. LLM prompting.

Result: Direct application of weighted rules outperforms prompting LLMs with rules and weights, showing LLMs excel at semantic generation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration.

Conclusion: RLIE clarifies LLMs' strengths in semantic tasks and limitations in probabilistic reasoning, demonstrating that coupling LLMs with classic probabilistic methods enables more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo is a transformer-based RL architecture that uses periodic summarization tokens to create and retrieve memories, enabling efficient handling of long-horizon tasks while outperforming naive long-context transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based policies for embodied agents struggle with visual inputs overwhelming context limits, while humans effectively compress lifetime experiences into memories. Existing approaches either use fixed-size recurrent memory or full-context transformers, lacking efficient memory compression.

Method: Memo incorporates memory creation and retrieval by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with model inputs during training, allowing the model to maintain compressed representations of past experiences.

Result: Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines on gridworld meta-RL and multi-object navigation tasks, showing better compute/storage efficiency, generalization to longer contexts, and robustness in streaming settings with truncated history.

Conclusion: The Memo architecture successfully addresses memory-intensive long-horizon tasks by enabling efficient memory compression and retrieval, demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PROBE is a new benchmark for evaluating proactive LLM agents that decomposes proactivity into three capabilities: searching for unspecified issues, identifying bottlenecks, and executing resolutions. Current state-of-the-art models achieve only 40% performance on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating proactive LLM agents are limited to localized contexts and cannot test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons, creating a gap in comprehensive proactivity evaluation.

Method: PROBE decomposes proactivity into a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. The method is applied to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks.

Result: Even state-of-the-art models struggle with the benchmark, with the best end-to-end performance of 40% achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. The study also demonstrates relative capabilities of each model and analyzes mutual failure modes.

Conclusion: The results highlight current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems and expose promising future research directions for improving proactive capabilities in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for learning and evaluating world models are anchored to next-frame prediction and reward maximization in the same environment, diverging from the goal of learning models that support many downstream tasks.

Method: WorldTest protocol with reward-free exploration phase followed by scored test phase in different but related environments, using AutumnBench suite with 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across masked-frame prediction, planning, and causal dynamics prediction.

Result: Humans outperform frontier models on AutumnBench, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others, exposing significant headroom in world-model learning.

Conclusion: WorldTest provides a novel template for evaluating what agents learn about environment dynamics, separating reward-free exploration from derived tests with behavior-based scoring.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived

### [99] [Towards Proprioceptive Terrain Mapping with Quadruped Robots for Exploration in Planetary Permanently Shadowed Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18986)
*Alberto Sanchez-Delgado,João Carlos Virgolino Soares,Victor Barasuol,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A terrain mapping framework for quadruped robots that estimates terrain interaction metrics (elevation, slippage, energy cost, stability) from proprioceptive sensing during locomotion in lunar PSRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) on the Moon contain valuable resources like water ice and geological records, but their complex terrain requires legged robots. While exteroceptive sensors capture terrain geometry, they cannot quantify physical interaction with the robot.

Method: Proposed a terrain mapping framework that incrementally integrates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability margins from internal proprioceptive sensing into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap during quadruped locomotion.

Result: The system was evaluated in a lunar environment simulator using the 21 kg Aliengo quadruped robot, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain conditions.

Conclusion: The proprioceptive-based terrain mapping framework enables legged robots to effectively quantify and map terrain interaction properties in challenging lunar PSR environments, complementing traditional exteroceptive sensing approaches.

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

*Chinmay Burgul,Yewei Huang,Michalis Chatzispyrou,Ioannis Rekleitis,Alberto Quattrini Li,Marios Xanthidis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of compact 3D sonar technology for underwater state estimation, introducing calibration methods, acoustic response analysis, and novel SLAM pipelines tested in challenging underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional underwater state estimation has been limited to 2D acoustic sensors with spatial ambiguity, while compact 3D sonars offer new opportunities for robust underwater autonomy similar to LiDAR-based systems in aerial and ground applications.

Method: Developed calibration procedures for 3D sonar-camera extrinsics, studied acoustic response across different surfaces/materials, and created novel mapping and SLAM pipelines tested in underwater cave systems and challenging environments.

Result: Demonstrated 3D sonars' unique capacity to capture consistent spatial information enabling detailed reconstructions and localization over hundreds of meters, while identifying remaining acoustic propagation challenges.

Conclusion: Compact 3D sonars represent a significant advancement for underwater state estimation, with promising capabilities for detailed mapping and localization, though acoustic propagation challenges persist. The authors will release datasets to support further research.

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SHRUMS is the first underwater autonomous navigation pipeline that integrates 3D sonar, using sensor hallucination to enable robust navigation in poor visibility conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous 3D navigation has advanced in terrestrial and aerial settings with LiDAR, but underwater robots lacked similar compact sensors until recent 3D sonar availability.

Method: The pipeline introduces sensor hallucination - generating measurements from non-existent sensors with tailored parameters to accommodate 3D sonar data while achieving real-time locally optimal performance.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong robustness in complex 3D environments despite poor visibility, validated with real 3D sonar data and real-time local map construction.

Conclusion: SHRUMS successfully integrates 3D sonar for underwater navigation, with field deployments planned to fully validate the approach.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

TL;DR: ∇-SDF is a hybrid method combining explicit gradient-augmented octree interpolation with neural residuals for efficient, differentiable, and non-truncated signed distance function reconstruction from point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDF estimation methods have limitations: volumetric methods lack continuity/differentiability, while neural methods are inefficient, suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and are restricted to truncated SDFs in large environments.

Method: Combines explicit prior from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with implicit neural residual, achieving hybrid approach that leverages strengths of both volumetric and neural methods.

Result: Achieves non-truncated Euclidean SDF reconstruction with computational/memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability/accuracy comparable to neural methods, outperforming state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Provides scalable solution for robotics and computer vision tasks by offering the best of both worlds: efficiency of volumetric methods and accuracy/differentiability of neural methods.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

*Shiyu Liu,Ilija Hadzic,Akshay Gupta,Aliasghar Arab*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a motion planning and control system for 4-wheel independent steering robots with mechanical swerve constraints, addressing discontinuities in the configuration space through mathematical formulation and smooth velocity transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable smooth and efficient motion for overactuated 4WIS robots where mechanical constraints prevent full 360-degree wheel rotations, creating discontinuities that affect motion smoothness.

Method: Developed mathematical formulation of steering constraints, derived discontinuity planes in velocity space, designed motion planner for path tracking and obstacle avoidance that accounts for swerve constraints, and implemented controller with local feedback and proper discontinuity handling.

Result: Implemented the motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and evaluated the system in both simulation and on a physical robot.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully handles the discontinuities in 4WIS robot motion through proper constraint modeling, smooth velocity transitions, and effective discontinuity crossing management.

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

*Fausto Vega,Jon Arrizabalaga,Ryan Watson,Zachary Manchester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithm for designing low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for spacecraft using convex optimization, transforming a nonconvex problem into a solvable semidefinite program that guarantees globally optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing satellite density in low-Earth orbit, manual conjunction analysis and maneuver planning is becoming inefficient, requiring autonomous solutions for collision avoidance.

Method: Formulate collision avoidance as a nonconvex QCQP, then relax it into a convex SDP using Shor's relaxation. The method produces minimum-energy solutions while ensuring desired collision probability, with fallback to minimum-risk solutions when constraints can't be satisfied.

Result: Empirical demonstration shows the relaxation is tight, enabling recovery of globally optimal solutions. Validation with high-fidelity simulation using conjunction data messages shows effective collision risk reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides an effective autonomous solution for spacecraft collision avoidance, handling both minimum-energy and minimum-risk scenarios through convex optimization techniques.

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Motivation: Current prosthetic hand control strategies lack adaptability and have high computational costs, limiting real-time deployment in assistive robotics.

Method: Developed a Neural Network-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (NN-MRAC) for tendon-driven soft continuum wrists, using Timoshenko beam theory for dynamic modeling and online adaptation to minimize deflection errors.

Result: Simulation: RMSE 6.14×10⁻⁴ m, settling time 3.2s. Experimental: average RMSE 5.66×10⁻³ m, steady-state error 8.05×10⁻³ m, settling time 1.58s.

Conclusion: The controller enhances motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic systems, advancing adaptive intelligent control in wearable assistive devices.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional methods (high computation time, parameter tuning) and prior learning-based methods (poor generalization) in robotic path planning for high-dimensional cluttered environments.

Method: Hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism combining classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the denoising process.

Result: Achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance further improving safety. Shows strong performance relative to sampling-based and learning-based baselines.

Conclusion: GADGET provides effective zero-shot transferability across different robots (Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3, UR5) and generates safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world settings, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRASPLAT is a novel grasping framework that uses RGB images to predict multi-fingered hand grasps by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting to synthesize realistic hand-object interaction views and incorporating photometric loss for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasping methods rely on complete 3D scans, which are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The approach uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB images and incorporating photometric loss to refine grasp predictions by minimizing rendering discrepancies.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates by up to 36.9% compared to existing image-based methods.

Conclusion: GRASPLAT demonstrates that consistent 3D information can be effectively leveraged using only RGB images for training, achieving superior grasping performance without requiring complete 3D scans.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon routing tasks for DLOs like cables and ropes are challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, abstract goal decomposition, and multi-step planning requirements in industrial and everyday settings.

Method: Hierarchical framework combining VLMs for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize plans, RL-trained low-level skills for execution, and failure recovery mechanism to reorient DLOs into insertion-feasible states.

Result: Outperforms next best baseline by nearly 50% and achieves 92.5% overall success rate across diverse long-horizon routing scenarios with object attributes, spatial descriptions, and implicit language commands.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework successfully addresses the challenges of DLO routing through integrated high-level reasoning and low-level skill execution, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness in complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

*Kefeng Huang,Jonathon Pipe,Alice E. Martin,Tianyuan Wang,Barnabas A. Franklin,Andy M. Tyrrell,Ian J. S. Fairlamb,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TARMAC is a taxonomy for robot manipulation in chemistry that defines core laboratory manipulation skills, enabling skill reuse and scalable automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chemistry lab automation systems require frequent human intervention and lack structured representations of robotic manipulation skills, limiting autonomy and transferability beyond specific tasks.

Method: Developed TARMAC taxonomy based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations, categorizing actions by functional role and physical execution requirements, and validated experimentally.

Result: TARMAC provides a domain-specific framework that can be instantiated as robot-executable primitives and composed into higher-level macros for skill reuse.

Conclusion: TARMAC offers a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous laboratory automation by enabling systematic organization and reuse of robotic manipulation skills.

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

*Yu Fang,Xinyu Wang,Xuehe Zhang,Wanli Xue,Mingwei Zhang,Shengyong Chen,Jie Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning to balance inference speed and performance, using adaptive gradient allocation for stable optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching methods in robot imitation learning suffer from high inference time, and existing distillation/consistency methods struggle to match original model performance.

Method: Extends multi-step consistency loss on shortcut model, splits one-step loss into multi-step losses, and uses adaptive gradient allocation for stable optimization.

Result: Evaluated in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world tasks, showing effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances inference speed and performance while maintaining stable learning process.

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

*Golnaz Raja,Ruslan Agishev,Miloš Prágr,Joni Pajarinen,Karel Zimmermann,Arun Kumar Singh,Reza Ghabcheloo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An efficient probabilistic framework for robot motion prediction that models spatially correlated terrain uncertainty and propagates it through differentiable physics for trajectory forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume deterministic or spatially independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring local correlations in 3D spatial data and producing unreliable predictions in unstructured off-road environments.

Method: Models spatially correlated aleatoric uncertainty as a probabilistic world model and propagates it through a differentiable physics engine for trajectory forecasting, using structured convolutional operators for efficiency.

Result: Significantly improved uncertainty estimation and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation baselines on publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides reliable uncertainty-aware motion prediction for safe autonomous navigation in unstructured environments with high perceptual uncertainty.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

*Basavasagar Patil,Sydney Belt,Jayjun Lee,Nima Fazeli,Bernadette Bucher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A simple sampling strategy to address dataset imbalance in robot action training by rebalancing physical action sequences across tasks, improving generalization without degrading performance on high-resource tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot training datasets are often imbalanced because different tasks may involve similar physical actions, leading to inefficient use of model capacity and poor generalization on low-resource tasks.

Method: Proposes a simple sampling strategy that requires minimal code changes to existing training pipelines, focusing on rebalancing the representation of physical robotic actions across tasks during policy training.

Result: Substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining performance on high-resource tasks. Validated in both simulated and real-world robot arm experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling method enables more effective use of model capacity for multi-task policies and improves generalization, making it a practical solution for dataset imbalance in robot learning.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

*Abdelrahman Sayed Sayed*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Bayesian approach to assess risks of losing Eely (articulated underwater robot) during missions in confined ocean environments, with sensitivity analysis to identify key risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for ocean discovery in confined environments requires articulated underwater robots like Eely, but these environments pose high risks including uncertain conditions, extreme environments, and limited navigation.

Method: Bayesian approach for risk assessment of mission scenarios, with sensitivity analysis to identify the most impactful causes of robot loss.

Result: Sensitivity analysis reveals the specific causes that have the highest impact on losing Eely during missions.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian risk assessment approach helps improve Eely's performance and mission success likelihood by identifying and addressing key risk factors.

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training VLA models requires large-scale real-world robot data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect, limiting scalability and generalization capacity of current systems.

Method: Leverages world model-generated data (video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer) and improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought supervision.

Result: Achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances, object placements, and camera viewpoints, with substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization, and an optimized lightweight variant (GigaBrain-0-Small) is designed for efficient deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

*Kevin Huang,Rosario Scalise,Cleah Winston,Ayush Agrawal,Yunchu Zhang,Rohan Baijal,Markus Grotz,Byron Boots,Benjamin Burchfiel,Hongkai Dai,Masha Itkina,Paarth Shah,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline reinforcement learning can be effectively used to leverage non-expert data (play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions) to enhance imitation learning policies, overcoming limitations of conventional imitation learning that relies on high-quality task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional imitation learning is limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, which restricts adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios. Non-expert data offers broader coverage and lower collection costs but is underutilized by current approaches.

Method: The paper proposes using offline reinforcement learning with simple algorithmic modifications to harness non-expert data. Key innovation involves broadening the support of the policy distribution to enable robust task solving.

Result: The approach significantly increases the range of initial conditions where learned policies succeed, shows enhanced recovery and generalization behavior in manipulation tasks, and can leverage all collected data including partial or suboptimal demonstrations to improve policy performance.

Conclusion: Algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data are crucial for robust policy learning in robotics, demonstrating that offline RL can effectively augment imitation learning when properly adapted to handle sparse data coverage.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prosthetic hand functionality and responsiveness through advanced control strategies that enable more natural and intuitive movements.

Method: Used MPC strategy with Euler-Bernoulli beam for kinematic modeling and Lagrange method for dynamic modeling, validated through simulations and experiments.

Result: MPC effectively optimized wrist articulation and user control, significantly improving prosthetic hand dexterity and making movements more natural.

Conclusion: This research offers a promising direction for intelligent prosthetic systems by demonstrating MPC's effectiveness in enhancing prosthetic performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LaViRA is a zero-shot framework for vision-and-language navigation that uses a coarse-to-fine action hierarchy with different MLLMs at each stage, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VLN-CE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off in current methods between environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit generalization and underutilization of large models' reasoning capabilities during navigation.

Method: Decomposes action into three hierarchical stages: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation, leveraging different scales of MLLMs at each stage.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on VLN-CE benchmark with superior generalization in unseen environments.

Conclusion: The modular decomposition approach creates a system that excels in reasoning, grounding, and practical control while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time visual relative localization for agile UAV swarms by developing fast onboard detection of isolated markers, which is crucial for swarm coordination and applications using low-end UAVs.

Method: Three-fold innovation: 1) optimized procedure for CPUs, 2) GPU shader program, and 3) functionally equivalent FPGA streaming architecture for marker detection.

Result: CPU and GPU solutions accelerated mean processing time per pixel by 2-3 orders of magnitude; FPGA architecture minimized total delay from camera exposure to detection results; demonstrated efficiency on various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms.

the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.

*Ameesh Shah,William Chen,Adwait Godbole,Federico Mora,Sanjit A. Seshia,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LITEN enables Vision-Language-Action models to learn from past failures by connecting a low-level policy with a high-level VLM that reflects on execution experiences, allowing dynamic behavior adjustment for complex robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs lack the ability to contextually readjust behavior when they fail tasks, unlike humans who learn from mistakes. There's a need for robots to reflect on failures and adapt strategies accordingly.

Method: LITEN iterates between reasoning (generating/executing plans with low-level VLA) and assessment (reflecting on execution results). It includes past experiences in-context for the high-level VLM to learn low-level VLA capabilities and affordances.

Result: LITEN effectively learns from past experience to generate plans using high-affordance instructions, enabling successful completion of long-horizon robotics tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed LITEN framework successfully bridges the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level execution in VLAs, allowing robots to learn from failures and improve performance on complex real-world control tasks.

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: SEA is a novel active robot exploration method that uses semantic map prediction and reinforcement learning to improve long-term environmental understanding and exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based exploration methods rely on one-step waypoint prediction, which limits long-term environmental understanding and exploration efficiency.

Method: An iterative prediction-exploration framework that predicts missing map areas from current observations, uses the difference between actual and predicted maps to guide exploration, and employs reinforcement learning with a novel reward mechanism to update long-term strategies.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior global map coverage within the same time constraints.

Conclusion: SEA enables more efficient robot exploration by enhancing long-term environmental understanding through semantic map prediction and reinforcement learning-based hierarchical policies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.
