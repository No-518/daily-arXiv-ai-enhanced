### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an analytic framework to determine when AI capability growth could escalate without bound (runaway growth) versus when it can be ruled out, based on measurable conditions like resource constraints and deployment policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace speculation about AI 'runaway growth' or 'singularity' with precise, testable conditions and deployable safety controls grounded in observable engineering measurements.

Method: Develops an analytic framework linking capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies, using physical and information-theoretic limits to define a service envelope. Creates an endogenous growth model coupling capital to compute, data, and energy, with decision rules based on observable metrics.

Result: Derives falsifiable tests and safety controls (power caps, throughput throttling, evaluation gates) that can certify or preclude runaway growth based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to current levels.

Conclusion: The framework provides testable conditions and practical controls for certifying or preventing an AI singularity, moving beyond speculation to measurable, implementable safety mechanisms.

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Conclusion: CAR-Scenes enables explainable, data-centric workflows for autonomous driving research by providing comprehensive annotations, analysis tools, and baseline models for vision-language understanding tasks.

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

Conclusion: Represents a meaningful step toward large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models like Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address procedural variability, difficult learning curves, and complications in minimally invasive colorectal surgery by creating a standardized tool for video-based workflow analysis.

Method: Used Delphi process to achieve consensus on workflow descriptors, developed ColoWorkflow tool, and validated it using multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal procedures with inter-rater reliability assessment.

Result: Achieved consensus on 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps. Tool demonstrated broad applicability with moderate inter-rater reliability (Cohen's K: 0.71 for phases, 0.66 for steps).

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow provides a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking and supporting AI-driven workflow recognition to standardize training and improve surgical quality.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

### [5] [Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774)
*Junjie Zhang,Feng Zhao,Hanqiang Liu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FVMGN for remote sensing image classification, addressing multimodal generalization through frequency-aware vision-language fusion and diffusion-based augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing faces multimodal heterogeneity and lacks modality-specific linguistic priors in vision-language models, requiring better cross-scene generalization.

Method: Uses diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation, multimodal wavelet disentanglement for frequency domain features, spatial-frequency-aware image encoder, and multiscale feature alignment.

Result: FVMGN demonstrates excellent multimodality generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-aware vision-language approach effectively handles RS multimodal heterogeneity and achieves superior generalization performance.

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To further reduce trainable parameters in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for point cloud data, as general PEFT approaches are suboptimal for this domain.

Method: GFT learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized transformer inputs using lightweight graph convolution, then passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules.

Result: Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show GFT rivals existing methods while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: GFT provides an effective point-cloud-specific PEFT approach that achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter requirements.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRP-based pruning methods suffer from significant accuracy degradation despite achieving high pruning rates, limiting their practical usability. There's a need for pruning approaches that work well with limited data and preserve model accuracy better.

Method: Uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explainable AI technique for model pruning, focusing on achieving higher pruning rates while better preserving accuracy, particularly effective with small amounts of data.

Result: The proposed method achieves pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing LRP-based pruning approaches, enabling higher pruning rates with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that improved LRP-based pruning can achieve practical model compression with limited data, offering better accuracy preservation than current methods while maintaining high pruning rates.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Conclusion: PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models, with theoretical guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity.

### [13] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision to enhance OOD detection by using LLM-initialized prompts that capture inter-class features and transfer semantic knowledge to visual modality via graph-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current negative prompts in vision-language models for OOD detection often include broad non-ID features, leading to suboptimal performance due to overlapping or misleading information capture.

Method: Uses LLM-initialized class-specific positive/negative prompts optimized to focus on intra-class features and category boundaries respectively, with graph-based architecture to aggregate semantic supervision and propagate to visual branch for energy-based OOD detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K across 8 OOD datasets and 5 LLMs show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances OOD detection by leveraging optimized prompt representations and semantic knowledge transfer between modalities.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial Expression Recognition remains challenging in real-world environments, and there's a need for lightweight models that can balance performance and efficiency for real-time, resource-constrained applications.

Method: Converted FER2013 and KDEF classification datasets into object detection format and evaluated YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n nano variants using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices within a unified detection and classification framework.

Result: YOLOv12n achieved highest overall performance on clean KDEF dataset (mAP 0.5: 95.6) and outperformed YOLOv11n on FER2013 (mAP 63.8 vs lower). YOLOv11n showed higher precision (65.2) on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives. Models showed more confusion between similar expressions on FER2013 but clearer separation on KDEF.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models effectively balance performance and efficiency, with YOLOv12n offering better sensitivity while YOLOv11n provides better precision in noisy conditions, making them strong candidates for real-time emotion-aware AI applications.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCD is a novel heterogeneous knowledge distillation framework that integrates complementary teacher-student features and uses sub-logit decoupled distillation with orthogonality loss to improve knowledge transfer between different architectures like ViT and ResNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods struggle with heterogeneous architectures due to differences in spatial feature representations, while existing heterogeneous KD approaches have high computational costs, complex designs, or over-rely on logit alignment, limiting their ability to leverage complementary features.

Method: HCD processes student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's penultimate layer features, maps via Complementary Feature Mapper to shared logits, then uses Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation to partition shared logits into n sub-logits fused with teacher's logits, with Orthogonality Loss to ensure diversity and reduce redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Fine-grained datasets (e.g., CUB200), and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: HCD effectively addresses heterogeneous KD challenges by preserving student-specific strengths while leveraging teacher knowledge, enhancing robustness and generalization in students.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

TL;DR: FedBCS addresses feature heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation by using domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment with frequency-domain style recalibration and dual-level prototype alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature heterogeneity from diverse medical scanners/protocols challenges federated learning. Existing methods have incomplete contextual representation learning (focusing only on final-layer features) and layerwise style bias accumulation (neglecting domain-specific biases in intermediate layers).

Method: Proposes FedBCS with frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration for prototype construction to decouple content-style representations, and context-aware dual-level prototype alignment that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from multiple encoder/decoder layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: FedBCS effectively bridges feature representation gaps in federated medical image segmentation through domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with 3D tasks due to the modality gap between 3D requirements and 2D training, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and embodied applications.

Method: A 3D Sandbox reconstruction pipeline with four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning using abstract bounding boxes.

Result: Achieved 8.3% gain on SAT Real benchmark in zero-shot settings, with consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones.

Conclusion: Equipping VLMs with 3D abstraction substantially enhances 3D reasoning ability without training, opening new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

*Ren Zhang,Huilai Li,Chao qi,Guoliang Xu,Tianyu Zhou,Wei wei,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM is a multimodal LLM approach for micro expression recognition that addresses motion-appearance entanglement and semantic gap issues through multi-expert disentanglement and a motion-driven instruction dataset called Uni-MER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MER methods struggle with: (1) entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues, preventing focus on subtle motion; (2) semantic gap between text labels and actual facial muscle movements in existing datasets.

Method: Proposes DEFT-LLM with multi-expert disentanglement architecture (structure, dynamic textures, motion-semantics experts) and introduces Uni-MER dataset with dual optical flow and Action Unit constraints for motion-text alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MER benchmarks and demonstrates particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM effectively injects physical priors for micro expressions while leveraging LLM reasoning capabilities, enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues through motion semantic alignment.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global dependencies, accommodating multimodal user customization, and handling the mismatch between temporal and semantic proximity in video frames.

Method: Proposes a Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) with: video graph generator creating structured graphs (forward, backward, undirected); intra-graph relational reasoning with dual-threshold graph convolution; language-guided cross-modal embedding; and modeling summary generation as Bernoulli mixture distribution solved with EM algorithm.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, reduces inference time by 87.8% and model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: LGRLN effectively addresses key challenges in video summarization by leveraging graph-based representation learning and language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in MIL-based DFER approaches, specifically the visual diversity of emotional expressions and complexity of temporal dynamics in the many-to-one labeling problem.

Method: Incorporates vision-language pre-trained models for semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions, uses visual prompts to align text with visual features, and employs a multi-grained temporal network to capture both short-term dynamics and long-range emotional flow.

Result: TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision, as demonstrated by extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed text-guided framework effectively enhances MIL-based DFER by leveraging semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling, providing a robust solution for dynamic facial expression recognition under weak supervision.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts transformer that uses eigenbasis reparameterization and cosine similarity routing to solve routing instability and load imbalance issues in MoE models, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE architectures face challenges with router-expert misalignment causing unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances creating bottlenecks. Existing solutions like auxiliary load-balancing losses weaken expert specialization and hurt performance.

Method: ERMoE reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an 'Eigenbasis Score' - the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing directly ties token assignments to experts' representation spaces.

Result: ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (COCO, Flickr30K), with flatter expert load distributions. A 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by >7% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Conclusion: ERMoE introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization, eliminating the need for explicit balancing losses.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC is a two-stage framework for CLIP-based class-incremental learning that decouples vision encoder adaptation from textual prompt optimization, with DMC-OT adding optimal-transport calibration to handle distributional drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending vision-language models like CLIP to continual learning settings is challenging due to classifier bias from task-specific soft prompts overfitting to recent categories when prior data is unavailable.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) adapt vision encoder with frozen text prompts, 2) optimize textual soft prompts with frozen vision encoder. DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration to align memory statistics across evolving encoders and task-specific prompting for inter-task separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 show state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by average 1.80% over DMC.

Conclusion: Decoupling vision and text adaptation stages effectively preserves cross-modal alignment in continual learning, and optimal-transport calibration addresses distributional drift in memory statistics.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAS (Phase Aggregated Smoothing) is a training-free method that stabilizes temporal attention in Video LLMs by applying opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregating outputs, reducing sensitivity to small frame timing shifts while preserving positional encoding structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency where small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames, traced to multimodal RoPE's inverse Fourier time kernel that exhibits frame-scale ripples.

Method: Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) applies small opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregates their outputs, effectively smoothing the temporal kernel and reducing phase sensitivity without changing positional encoding structure.

Result: Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead, providing Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts.

Conclusion: PAS provides a plug-and-play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs, attenuating high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

TL;DR: A training-free binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision that converts open-ended queries to multiple-choice questions and then to True/False verifications, improving accuracy across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve zero-shot vision performance with off-the-shelf VLMs by developing a simple, unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design rather than task-specific training.

Method: Two-step workflow: (1) quantization - converts open-ended queries to multiple-choice questions with explicit candidates, (2) binarization - asks True/False questions per candidate and resolves deterministically (select if exactly one True, otherwise revert to MCQ).

Result: Quantization to MCQ yields large gains over direct open-ended queries, and True/False binarization provides consistent additional boost. Significant improvements across all evaluated tasks (referring expression grounding, spatial reasoning, BLINK-Jigsaw).

Conclusion: The workflow offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with current VLMs, establishing a hardness ladder from open-ended queries to MCQs to True/False verifications.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPAC, a practical autoregressive framework for learned lossless image compression that achieves state-of-the-art performance through hierarchical parallelism, progressive adaptation, and efficient inference optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are theoretically optimal for lossless compression but are considered impractical due to computational costs. This work aims to make pure autoregression practical while maintaining its theoretical advantages.

Method: HPAC uses hierarchical factorized structure with content-aware convolutional gating. Key optimizations include Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI) for acceleration and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC) for high bit-depth images. Progressive adaptation via SARP-FT fine-tunes models per image using low-rank adapters on spatially-continuous regions.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art compression across diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) with significant gains over existing methods, small parameter count, and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: A carefully designed autoregressive framework can offer substantial compression improvements while being practical, challenging the conventional wisdom that AR models are too computationally expensive for real-world use.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid dataset and validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception, providing comprehensive physics-informed simulation data for dynamic liquid behaviors.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment.

*Keunwoo Park,Jihye Chae,Joong Ho Ahn,Jihoon Kweon*

TL;DR: CLUE is a generative model framework that achieves diverse and stable image generation using fixed-format prompts without additional data, particularly effective for specialized domains like medicine with limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods face limitations in specialized fields like medicine where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available, requiring solutions that work with constrained datasets.

Method: Based on Stable Diffusion, CLUE uses a Style Encoder to generate style embeddings from images and prompts, feeding them into a new second attention layer in U-Net. It employs Kullback-Leibler divergence to achieve continuous representation of image features in Gaussian regions independent of prompts.

Result: On otitis media dataset, CLUE reduced FID from 46.81 to 9.30 and improved recall from 49.60% to 70.29%. Synthetic-only training at 1000% scale achieved F1 score of 83.21% vs 73.83%. Combined synthetic+real data achieved 94.76% F1 score, higher than real-only data.

Conclusion: CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications, demonstrating superior performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Saptarshi Neil Sinha,Julius Kühn,Mika Silvan Goschke,Michael Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a synthetic data pipeline for 6D pose estimation of strawberries using YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, achieving comparable accuracy on both high-end and edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address labor shortages and high costs in fruit harvesting through automated solutions, with focus on overcoming training data scarcity for strawberry pose estimation.

Method: Procedural Blender pipeline for generating photorealistic synthetic strawberry data, combined with YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm for single-shot pose estimation.

Result: Models achieve comparable accuracy on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano, with good performance on ripe/partially ripe strawberries but challenges with unripe specimens.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for agricultural robotics deployment, particularly on resource-constrained devices, and can be adapted to other fruits like apples and peaches.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

### [29] [PROMISE: Prompt-Attentive Hierarchical Contrastive Learning for Robust Cross-Modal Representation with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10997)
*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE is a novel multimodal framework that uses prompt-attention hierarchical contrastive learning to maintain robust cross-modal representations when certain modalities are missing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models perform poorly when modalities are missing due to inconsistent representation learning between complete and incomplete data scenarios. Existing generation-based approaches fail to preserve cross-modal consistency.

Method: PROMISE incorporates multimodal prompt learning into hierarchical contrastive learning with a prompt-attention mechanism that dynamically generates robust representations for missing modality scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show PROMISE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal methods, with comprehensive ablation studies validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed PROMISE framework effectively bridges the representational gap between complete and incomplete multimodal data, demonstrating robust performance in real-world scenarios with missing modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

*Zongyang Qiu,Bingyuan Wang,Xingbei Chen,Yingqing He,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid is the first multimodal emotion-annotated video dataset for creative media, enabling emotion-conditioned video generation that significantly improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation systems focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions, and there's a lack of dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, especially for stylized and non-realistic contexts.

Method: Created EmoVid dataset with emotion labels, visual attributes, and text captions; analyzed spatial-temporal patterns linking visual features to emotions; developed emotion-conditioned video generation by fine-tuning Wan2.1 model.

Result: Significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing, providing insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos and practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

*Yiran Song,Yikai Zhang,Shuang Zhou,Guojun Xiong,Xiaofeng Yang,Nian Wang,Fenglong Ma,Rui Zhang,Mingquan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCaMIL is a causality-aware multiple instance learning framework for whole slide image analysis that addresses fairness concerns by explicitly modeling demographic confounders through causal graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved fairness across diverse populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for pathology analysis lack causal interpretability and fail to integrate patient demographics, leading to fairness concerns and algorithmic bias that can exacerbate health disparities, hindering clinical translation.

Method: MeCaMIL employs structured causal graphs and principled causal inference using do-calculus and collider structures to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations, treating demographics as confounders rather than auxiliary features.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970), with 65% relative reduction in demographic disparity variance and improved fairness for underserved populations. Also generalizes to survival prediction (C-index: 0.653).

Conclusion: MeCaMIL establishes a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology, with causal graph structure being essential for both performance and fairness improvements.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Draft and Refine (DnR) is an agent framework that uses a question-conditioned utilization metric to measure and improve LVLMs' reliance on visual evidence, reducing hallucinations by refining responses with external visual experts' feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses due to over-reliance on linguistic priors rather than visual evidence, highlighting the need for a quantitative measure of visual information utilization during reasoning.

Method: DnR framework uses a question-conditioned utilization metric to localize question-specific visual cues and measure visual dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. The agent refines initial drafts using targeted feedback from external visual experts, whose outputs are rendered as visual cues on images.

Result: Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating improved visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems, enabling stronger visual grounding in LVLMs.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from a visual processing bottleneck where they lose grounding in visual evidence and lack contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation, limiting their performance on complex visual tasks.

Method: Proposes VisMem framework with dynamic latent vision memories: short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation, inspired by human cognitive memory theory.

Result: Extensive experiments show VisMem delivers 11.8% average performance improvement over vanilla models and outperforms all counterparts across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement in VLMs, enabling them to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency during thinking and generation processes.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

*Sumin Yu,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard is a new method that improves safety in diffusion-based text-to-image generation by adaptively estimating prompt harmfulness and selectively guiding only unsafe image regions, outperforming existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based T2I models enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack adaptivity (adjusting guidance strength based on prompt) and selectivity (targeting only unsafe regions).

Method: SP-Guard estimates prompt harmfulness and applies a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas of the image, addressing both adaptivity and selectivity limitations of previous methods.

Result: Experiments show SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.

Conclusion: Beyond improving safety, the findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

*Siheon Joo,Hongjo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUPER (Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction) is a plug-and-play decoder block for U-Net variants that uses wavelet perfect reconstruction to prevent information loss while selectively suppressing redundant features, improving high-frequency detail recovery in inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) suffer from information loss that limits recovery of fine high-frequency details in inverse problems.

Method: Exploits perfect reconstruction property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing redundant features, serving as a plug-and-play decoder block for U-Net variants without rigid framelet constraints.

Result: Markedly improves thin-crack segmentation for cracks narrower than 4px, achieves moderate PSNR gains in smartphone image denoising, and maintains comparable computational cost while enriching representational diversity.

Conclusion: SUPER provides plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified reconstruction-aware framework, robust across both low- and high-frequency regimes.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

TL;DR: AirCopBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging conditions, featuring 14.6k+ questions across 4 task dimensions and revealing significant performance gaps between current models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a scarcity of benchmarks for multi-agent collaborative perception despite the advantages of multi-drone systems over single-sensor setups. Existing benchmarks focus on basic perception tasks using high-quality images and fail to evaluate MLLMs in complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios under real-world degraded perception conditions.

Method: The authors introduce AirCopBench with 14.6k+ questions derived from simulator and real-world data, spanning four task dimensions (Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, Collaborative Decision) across 14 task types. Questions are generated through model-, rule-, and human-based methods with rigorous quality control, using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events.

Result: Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AirCopBench addresses the critical gap in multi-agent collaborative perception evaluation and reveals substantial room for improvement in MLLMs' collaborative capabilities, while demonstrating the potential for sim-to-real transfer in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmbryoDiff is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for embryo stage classification that uses multi-focal feature fusion and hybrid semantic-boundary conditioning to address cell occlusion issues and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for IVF embryo stage classification fail to utilize developmental distribution priors and rely on single-focal information, leading to incomplete representations and susceptibility to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Train frame-level encoder for robust multi-focal features, 2) Use Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy to create 3D-aware representations, then apply Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject semantic and boundary cues into diffusion-based denoising process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on two benchmark datasets, obtaining best average test performance with only a single denoising step.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging multi-focal information and diffusion-based modeling, providing robust embryo stage classification even under challenging conditions like cell occlusions.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict patients' health insurance type (a proxy for socioeconomic status) from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy, revealing that medical images contain hidden social signatures of inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether medical AI models can detect invisible traces of social inequality in medical imaging data, challenging the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

Method: Trained state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) on chest X-rays from MIMIC-CXR-JPG and CheXpert datasets to predict health insurance type, used patch-based occlusion to localize signals, and controlled for age, race, and sex variables.

Result: Models achieved AUC around 0.67-0.68 in predicting insurance type, with the signal persisting even when controlling for demographic factors and remaining detectable when trained on single racial groups. The signal was diffuse across upper and mid-thoracic regions.

Conclusion: Medical AI models internalize subtle traces of socioeconomic segregation from clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways, requiring a reframing of fairness in medical AI to interrogate and disentangle social fingerprints embedded in clinical data.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGC is a hybrid-grained cache approach that improves controllable generative model efficiency by using block-level coarse-grained cache for feature reuse and prompt-level fine-grained cache for cross-attention map reuse, reducing computational cost by 63% while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable generative models face efficiency challenges due to computational requirements for handling control conditions and content generation, resulting in low generation efficiency.

Method: Proposes Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) with two strategies: (1) coarse-grained block-level cache for dynamic bypass of redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks, and (2) fine-grained prompt-level cache that reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends to adjacent module computations.

Result: On COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, HGC reduces computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T) while keeping semantic fidelity loss within 1.5%. Validated on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HGC effectively balances generation efficiency and visual quality in controllable generative models through hybrid-grained caching strategies that can be seamlessly integrated into computational links.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPCGNet introduces coupling gates and three modules (CGMFE, WCAD, DFA) to improve polyp segmentation by addressing noise, boundary ambiguity, and small polyp detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current polyp segmentation methods face challenges with missing small polyps, ambiguous boundaries, and noise from uneven lighting in colonoscopy images, which affect diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Proposes MPCGNet with coupling gates for noise filtering and feature selection. Uses three modules: CGMFE for local feature extraction and noise suppression, WCAD decoder for detail restoration and polyp localization, and DFA for progressive feature aggregation and importance selection.

Result: Outperforms recent networks with mDice scores 2.20% higher on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and 0.68% higher on CVC-ColonDB datasets compared to second-best methods.

Conclusion: The coupling gates approach effectively addresses key challenges in polyp segmentation, particularly for small polyps and noisy environments, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

*Pooja Singh,Siddhant Ujjain,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Sandeep Kumar*

TL;DR: CrossMed is a benchmark for evaluating compositional generalization in medical multimodal LLMs using a Modality-Anatomy-Task schema, showing significant performance drops in unrelated and zero-overlap conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to generalize across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type in medical AI, which remains underexplored.

Method: Reformulated four public medical datasets into unified VQA format using MAT schema, evaluated two multimodal LLMs on Related, Unrelated, and zero-overlap splits.

Result: Models achieved 83.2% classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU on Related splits, but performance dropped significantly in Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, with cross-task transfer improving segmentation by 7% cIoU.

Conclusion: CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating compositional generalization, showing multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at this capability while traditional models show modest gains.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

*Jiaming Huang,Yi Gao,Fuchang Pan,Renjie Li,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticNN is a semantic codec for device-edge collaboration that tolerates bit-level errors to achieve semantic-level correctness, enabling efficient and resilient inference offloading under computational and communication constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With IoT growth, AI integration on weak embedded devices faces resource limitations and unreliable networks, requiring error-resilient systems. Traditional bit-level transmission approaches are inefficient under dynamic channel conditions.

Method: Proposes SemanticNN with BER-aware decoder for dynamic channel adaptation, Soft Quantization-based encoder for compact representations, Feature-augmentation Learning for training efficiency, and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to handle encoder-decoder capability mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments on STM32 with three models and six datasets show SemanticNN reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy under varying transmission error rates.

Conclusion: SemanticNN enables compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading, significantly improving transmission efficiency while maintaining accuracy in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

### [43] [Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network for Text-3D Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11045)
*Wenrui Li,Yidan Lu,Yeyu Chai,Rui Zhao,Hengyu Man,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H²ARN addresses text-3D retrieval challenges by using hyperbolic space embeddings to preserve hierarchies and a contribution-aware aggregation module to handle redundancy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on an expanded benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-3D retrieval methods suffer from Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) that compresses abstract-to-specific hierarchies and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD) that averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues.

Method: H²ARN embeds text and 3D data in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space to preserve hierarchical distances. It uses hierarchical ordering loss to construct entailment cones and instance-level contrastive loss for separation. A contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module leverages Lorentzian distance for relevance assessment and weighted aggregation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark containing 8,935 text-to-3D pairs (2.6x original size), covering cultural artefacts and indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings effectively address hierarchy collapse in text-3D retrieval, while contribution-aware aggregation mitigates redundancy issues, providing a robust solution for complex 3D data retrieval tasks.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PINGS-X is a novel framework using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, achieving faster training and superior accuracy compared to physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of cardiovascular conditions, but achieving this resolution leads to prolonged scan times. Existing PINN-based approaches have slow training that must be performed for each patient, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Proposes PINGS-X framework using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations, inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting. Key innovations include: normalized Gaussian splatting with convergence guarantee, axes-aligned Gaussians for high-dimensional data, and Gaussian merging for efficiency.

Result: Experimental results on CFD and real 4D flow MRI datasets show PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PINGS-X provides an efficient and accurate solution for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, overcoming the limitations of PINN-based approaches through novel Gaussian representation techniques.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

### [45] [NP-LoRA: Null Space Projection Unifies Subject and Style in LoRA Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11051)
*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that prevents structural interference by enforcing subspace separation between principal directions of subject and style LoRAs, improving fusion quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods suffer from interference where one LoRA dominates the other due to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations in low-rank subspaces, leading to degraded fidelity.

Method: Extract principal style directions via SVD, project subject LoRA into orthogonal null space, and use soft projection mechanism for smooth control over subject fidelity vs style consistency trade-off.

Result: NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines across DINO and CLIP metrics, human and LLM preference scores, and works broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed NP-LoRA framework effectively prevents structural interference in LoRA fusion through subspace separation, enabling high-quality controllable generation without costly retraining.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-reference generative image composition model that uses calibrated global and local features from multiple foreground reference images to improve detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment when inserting objects into backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative image composition methods struggle with simultaneously preserving details and adjusting foreground pose/view when inserting objects into backgrounds.

Method: Extend generative composition model to multi-reference version, calibrate global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with background information, and use calibrated features to supplement original reference features.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom datasets demonstrate that generative models greatly benefit from calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-reference approach with calibrated features effectively addresses the challenges of detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment in image composition.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention accelerates diffusion transformers for video generation by exploiting temporal coherence in attention sparsity patterns across denoising steps, enabling evolutionary computation skips without quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers for video generation suffer from quadratic attention complexity causing prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face trade-offs between dynamic estimation overhead and static pattern suboptimality.

Method: Identifies temporal coherence in diffusion attention sparsity patterns, introduces LiteAttention that marks non-essential tiles early and propagates skip decisions forward across denoising steps, eliminating redundant computations without repeated profiling.

Result: Substantial speedups on production video diffusion models with no degradation in quality, implemented as optimized kernel on top of FlashAttention.

Conclusion: LiteAttention combines adaptivity of dynamic methods with efficiency of static ones by exploiting temporal coherence in attention patterns, providing effective acceleration for video diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2D-Align is a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment in radiology report generation by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities through a shallow-to-deep strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment in RRG due to templated nature of reports, leading to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: Proposes S2D-Align with shallow-to-deep strategy: coarse radiograph-report pairing → instance-level guidance with reference reports → anatomical grounding with key phrases. Uses memory-based adapter for feature sharing between alignment stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach.

Conclusion: S2D-Align enhances grounding capabilities in complex multi-modal generation tasks and represents a promising direction for RRG.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no consensus on which generative models work best for 3D data tasks, and conditional information like partial 3D data hasn't been thoroughly evaluated for steering generation.

Method: Adapted Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers for generative shape modeling and completion, with thorough quantitative evaluation including baseline discriminative model and extensive ablation study.

Result: Diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both discriminative model and autoregressive approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from single noisy depth images. When compared on same discrete latent space, autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with continuous latents are superior for shape completion tasks under realistic conditions, but autoregressive models can be competitive when operating in the same discrete latent space.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) from text to video language models is challenging, and existing approaches don't properly model the distinct processes of perception and reasoning in video understanding.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) SFT stage with three-step pipeline to create VideoP2R-CoT-162K dataset, (2) RL stage with process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) that provides separate rewards for perception and reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 out of 7 video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of process-aware modeling and show perception output contains sufficient information for reasoning.

Conclusion: Process-aware modeling of perception and reasoning as distinct processes significantly improves video reasoning capabilities in large video language models through the proposed VideoP2R framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction models have computational limitations and degrade at nowcasting timescales (0-4 hours), while AI-weather prediction alternatives using video-understanding architectures remain underexplored.

Method: Proposed SaTformer - a video transformer built on full space-time attention, reformulated precipitation regression as classification, and used class-weighted loss to handle long-tailed precipitation datasets.

Result: The model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.

Conclusion: Video transformers with full space-time attention can effectively forecast extreme precipitation from satellite data, addressing limitations of traditional NWP models for nowcasting applications.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD is an improved image-to-image translation framework that uses optimal transport theory to fix latent distribution mismatches in DDIB methods, achieving 20.29% faster sampling and 2.6 FID score reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key challenges in DDIB-based image translation: low translation efficiency and translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions between source and target domains.

Method: Compute an optimal transport map from source to target latent distributions, then use the mapped distribution as starting point for reverse diffusion in target domain, eliminating distribution mismatches.

Result: OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces FID score by 2.6 on average across four translation tasks on three high-resolution datasets compared to top-performing baselines.

Conclusion: OT-ALD effectively balances faster translation with improved quality by leveraging optimal transport theory to solve latent distribution mismatch issues in diffusion-based image translation.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality.

*Dylan Saeed,Ramtin Gharleghi,Susann Bier,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT scans as a scalable training domain for coronary artery calcification (CAC) detection, achieving competitive performance with chest X-ray-based methods while overcoming label scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is the gold standard for CAC detection but is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays lack reliable ground truth labels, limiting deep learning development.

Method: Generated synthetic DRRs from 667 CT scans, evaluated model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing strategies, and training approaches including curriculum learning under weak supervision.

Result: Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperformed large pretrained networks; super-resolution with contrast enhancement yielded significant gains; best configuration achieved mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to prior CXR-based studies.

Conclusion: DRRs provide a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection and lay groundwork for future transfer learning to real chest X-rays.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVQA is a debate-based multi-agent framework that improves calibration in Visual Question Answering systems by having specialized VLMs generate answers and engage in critique-refinement interactions, with a novel calibration-aware loss function to fine-tune confidence estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VQA systems using vision-language models often produce overconfident responses, which is problematic for high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation where reliable confidence estimates are crucial.

Method: A debate-based multi-agent framework where diverse specialized VLMs with distinct prompting strategies generate candidate answers, followed by two-stage interactions where generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate proposals. Includes a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function (aligncal) to fine-tune specialized agents by minimizing calibration error bounds.

Result: Empirical results across multiple VQA benchmarks show substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. More calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences.

Conclusion: The AlignVQA framework effectively improves calibration in VQA systems through multi-agent debate and calibration-aware fine-tuning, making confidence estimates more reliable for autonomous decision-making under visual uncertainty.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot learning approach using contrastive learning with PRISMA hyperspectral data to detect bark beetle infestations in coniferous forests, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bark beetle infestations pose serious threats to coniferous forest health, requiring effective monitoring methods to detect and quantify damage.

Method: Contrastive learning framework pre-trains a 1D CNN encoder to extract robust features from hyperspectral data, followed by support vector regression estimators trained on few labeled samples to estimate tree health proportions per pixel.

Result: The method outperforms using original PRISMA spectral bands and Sentinel-2 data in experiments conducted in the Dolomites study area.

Conclusion: PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning provides significant advantages for forest health monitoring and bark beetle detection.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

*Abiram Panchalingam,Indu Bodala,Stuart Middleton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze enhances 3D gaze redirection using Diffusion Transformers, weak supervision with synthetic intermediate gaze angles, and orthogonality constraint loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting models struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts, which limits their effectiveness for generating augmented data to improve gaze estimator generalization.

Method: Combines Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for higher-fidelity image synthesis, weak supervision using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles to create smooth gaze direction manifolds, and orthogonality constraint loss to disentangle gaze, head pose, and expression representations.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance, reducing gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, and achieves superior perceptual quality and redirection accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze provides a superior method for creating synthetic training data for gaze estimation, with code and models to be made available for research community benchmarking.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel AI framework for gaze target detection in autistic children, addressing the challenge of joint attention measurement in ASD through a socially aware coarse-to-fine approach that handles class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic gaze target detection can help autistic children who lack access to professionals, as joint attention is a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder where children often show reduced gaze to faces.

Method: Proposes Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) framework with two-pathway architecture using expert models for social and non-social gaze, guided by context-awareness gate module. Uses the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in autistic children, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses class imbalance in autism datasets and provides an effective solution for automated joint attention measurement in ASD populations.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

*Redwan Hussain,Mizanur Rahman,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, identifies common limitations and challenges, and suggests multimodal deep learning as a promising research direction for more robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI-generated media (GANs, diffusion models) has made it difficult to distinguish real from synthetic content, enabling misuse like deepfakes for misinformation, privacy violations, and fraud, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Systematic review of 24 recent studies on AI-generated media detection, examining each individually to identify contributions and weaknesses, then summarizing common limitations and key challenges.

Result: Current detection models using CNNs and ViTs often fail to generalize across unseen data, struggle with content from different models, and are ineffective with multimodal data and highly modified content.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning models offer a promising research direction for more robust and generalized detection of synthetic media, providing future researchers with a clear starting point for building stronger defenses.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

### [61] [D-GAP: Improving Out-of-Domain Robustness via Dataset-Agnostic and Gradient-Guided Augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11286)
*Ruoqi Wang,Haitao Wang,Shaojie Guo,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP is a dataset-agnostic augmentation method that improves out-of-domain robustness by performing targeted augmentations in both frequency (amplitude) and pixel spaces using gradient-guided sensitivity maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with domain shifts due to learning biases toward domain-specific frequency components, and existing frequency perturbation methods overlook pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal OOD performance.

Method: D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in frequency space from task gradients to identify model response to frequency components, then adaptively interpolates amplitudes between source and target samples, complemented by pixel-space blending to restore spatial details.

Result: Extensive experiments show D-GAP outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets across four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks.

Conclusion: D-GAP effectively addresses frequency-space learning bias while preserving pixel-level details, providing consistent OOD robustness improvements without requiring dataset-specific expert knowledge.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: LVGM is a novel model that generates vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting stroke sequences using fine-tuned LLMs, achieving scalable vector glyph generation from limited strokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vectorized glyphs are essential for scalable design applications, and LLMs' sequence prediction capabilities can be leveraged for stroke-based character generation.

Method: Fine-tuned DeepSeek LLM to predict next stroke embeddings from discrete latent variables, trained on a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset with 907,267 stroke-based samples.

Result: Model generates complete characters, elegant words, and unseen verses from limited strokes, shows scaling behavior with data, and expert-validated output quality.

Conclusion: LVGM successfully bridges LLM capabilities with vector glyph generation, enabling scalable and flexible Chinese character synthesis through stroke sequence modeling.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

TL;DR: HinD framework with KEPO elicits internal knowledge reasoning in MLLMs through hindsight distillation and preference optimization, achieving superior KBVQA performance without external APIs or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBVQA methods lack explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories from MLLMs, either using implicit knowledge via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval, leaving reasoning processes implicit.

Method: 1) Use hindsight wisdom by prompting frozen 7B MLLM to complete reasoning between question and ground truth, creating Hindsight-Zero training data. 2) Self-distill into CoT Generator and Knowledge Generator for sequential steps and discrete facts. 3) Optimize Knowledge Generator with KEPO to prefer under-confident helpful knowledge over over-confident unhelpful knowledge.

Result: Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Conclusion: HinD framework effectively elicits and harnesses internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs through hindsight distillation and knowledge encouragement preference optimization, providing explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories for KBVQA.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

*Haokun Chen,Jianing Li,Yao Zhang,Jinhe Bi,Yan Xia,Jindong Gu,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUVIC is a novel framework for visual concept unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models that uses adversarial perturbations to precisely remove target visual concepts while preserving performance on related entities, achieving state-of-the-art forgetting rates with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs trained on massive datasets raise data privacy concerns due to sensitive/copyrighted content, and regulatory 'right to be forgotten' requirements necessitate machine unlearning capabilities. While text unlearning is established, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored, particularly the challenge of precisely removing target concepts without affecting related entities.

Method: AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting of target visual concepts in MLLMs. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. The authors also construct VCUBench, the first benchmark for assessing visual concept unlearning in group contexts.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurring minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: AUVIC provides an effective solution for visual concept unlearning in MLLMs, addressing privacy concerns and regulatory requirements while maintaining model performance on related concepts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how text-to-image diffusion models handle cultural references, distinguishing between recognizing references and how they depict them (replication vs. transformation). The authors develop an evaluation framework that better captures this distinction than existing similarity methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in diffusion models, specifically focusing on multimodal iconicity where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations like familiar artworks or film scenes.

Method: Introduced an evaluation framework separating recognition (identifying references) from realization (how references are depicted). Evaluated 5 diffusion models on 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references using prompt perturbation experiments with synonym substitutions and literal descriptions.

Result: The framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than similarity-based methods. Models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Cultural alignment correlates with training data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: The value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

### [66] [Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164)
*Conghao Wong,Ziqian Zou,Beihao Xia,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reverberation-based trajectory prediction model that explicitly learns and predicts agent latency preferences (temporal delays in responding to trajectory-changing events) using learnable reverberation kernels, enabling controllable and interpretable trajectory forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction methods struggle to explicitly model agent latencies - the temporal delays with which agents respond to trajectory-changing events. Different agents have distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to events, and ignoring these latencies can undermine causal continuity and produce implausible trajectories.

Method: Proposed a reverberation transform and Reverberation (Rev) model inspired by acoustics reverberation curves. Uses two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels to simulate and predict different latency preferences of each agent and their stochasticity, enabling controllable trajectory prediction based on forecasted latencies.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (pedestrians and vehicles) show competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses verify the properties of the reverberation transform.

Conclusion: The proposed reverberation transform serves as a general latency modeling approach that achieves both competitive prediction accuracy and provides interpretable insights into agent latency dynamics, bridging temporal continuity in trajectory forecasting.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRD-UQA is a benchmark for evaluating Visual Large Language Models' ability to detect plausible but unanswerable questions in Visually Rich Documents, revealing significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs excel at Visual Question Answering on multi-page VRDs but their capability to detect unanswerable questions remains an open research question, especially for plausible questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions.

Method: Created VRD-UQA benchmark that automatically alters questions from existing VQA datasets by replacing entities with related concepts, changing document elements, and modifying layout positions. Uses VLLM-as-a-judge to verify unanswerability and evaluates 12 models across multiple dimensions including corruption types and knowledge injection strategies.

Result: Experiments reveal VLLMs' limitations in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels. Different corruption types (NLP entity, document element, layout) affect performance differently. Knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning show varying effectiveness.

Conclusion: VRD-UQA serves as an effective evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems, highlighting the need for improved robustness in VLLMs against plausible unanswerable questions.

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

### [68] [Explainable Deep Convolutional Multi-Type Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11165)
*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD is a lightweight convolutional framework for explainable multi-type anomaly detection that uses image-level labels to generate multi-channel heatmaps, with each channel corresponding to a specific anomaly type, enabling efficient differentiation of anomaly types across multiple object categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable anomaly detection methods lack the ability to differentiate anomaly types and require separate models for each object category, while large-scale VLMs are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time systems.

Method: Proposes MultiTypeFCDD - a simple convolutional framework that uses image-level labels to learn multi-channel heatmaps where each channel corresponds to a specific anomaly type, functioning as a single unified framework for multiple object categories.

Result: Evaluated on Real-IAD dataset and delivers competitive results with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD provides a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications with constrained computational resources, eliminating the need for separate models per object category.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

TL;DR: ImAgent is a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation in a single framework to improve text-to-image generation consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models suffer from randomness and inconsistency with vague prompts, and existing solutions require additional modules that increase computational overhead and hinder test-time scaling efficiency.

Method: ImAgent uses a policy controller to guide multiple generation actions that dynamically interact and self-organize, integrating reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single training-free framework without external models.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImAgent consistently improves over backbone models and surpasses other baselines, even when backbone models fail, demonstrating enhanced image fidelity and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: ImAgent highlights the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling conditions.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATS-V2V is the first real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception in complex adverse traffic scenarios, featuring 100 clips with LiDAR, camera, and GNSS/IMU data across 10 weather/lighting conditions and locations.


<details>

Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ordinary traffic scenarios, limiting cooperative perception benefits in complex adverse conditions where V2V could significantly enhance autonomous driving performance.

Method: Collected using two time-synchronized vehicles across 10 diverse locations and weather conditions, with target-based temporal alignment to ensure precise object alignment across all sensor modalities.

Result: Created a dataset with 60K LiDAR frames, 1.26M camera images, 750K GNSS/IMU records, and time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations, enabling 4D BEV representation construction.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V is the largest, most comprehensive dataset of its kind that will benefit the autonomous driving community in advancing V2V cooperative perception research.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAS, a training-free method that uses attention weights over previously generated tokens to detect object hallucinations in LVLMs by identifying when models ignore images and rely on their own output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from object hallucinations where they generate objects not present in images, making them unreliable despite their capabilities.

Method: Proposes Prelim Attention Score (PAS) - a lightweight signal computed from attention weights over previously generated tokens during inference, requiring no additional forward passes or training.

Result: PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention by identifying weak image dependence.

Conclusion: Attention weights over previously generated tokens provide a powerful, previously overlooked signal for detecting when LVLMs ignore images and hallucinate objects, offering a practical solution for improving reliability.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A temporal alignment strategy for 4D Gaussian Splatting that handles unsynchronized multi-view videos through coarse-to-fine time shift estimation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view videos often suffer from temporal misalignment due to camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, which degrades 4DGS reconstruction quality that assumes synchronized inputs.

Method: Coarse-to-fine alignment module that first estimates frame-level offsets and then refines to sub-frame accuracy, designed as an integrable module for existing 4DGS frameworks.

Result: Effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods in 4DGS reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal alignment strategy improves 4DGS robustness for real-world asynchronous multi-view video data while maintaining integration compatibility with existing frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Viper-F1 is a hybrid state-space vision-language model that replaces attention with efficient liquid state-space dynamics for improved computational efficiency, and uses a token-grid correlation module for better visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of multimodal large language models and their limitations in capturing fine-grained visual regions for real-world applications like robotic manipulation and smart cameras.

Method: Replace Transformer-based cross-attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics, and introduce a Token-Grid Correlation Module that computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches with FiLM conditioning.

Result: Achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency across multiple benchmarks while maintaining linear-time inference.

Conclusion: Viper-F1 provides an efficient solution for vision-language understanding that enables precise visual grounding with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Result: Substantial performance gains over Aurora foundation model demonstrated by RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM metrics on 2024 test data.

Conclusion: Compact specialized deep learning models are highly effective for short-range pollution forecasts on limited spatial domains, outperforming larger foundation models.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective short-term rainfall prediction system for the Weather4Cast 2025 competition using transfer learning and infrared satellite data.

Method: Two-stage training: first stage trains ConvGRU to forecast SEVIRI brightness temperatures from four hourly observations; second stage applies nonlinear transformation to convert predictions to rainfall rates. Event prediction uses 3D detection and feature extraction.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in cumulative rainfall task. Same model performed at baseline level for event prediction without modifications.

Conclusion: The ConvGRU-based transfer learning framework effectively predicts rainfall using single infrared channel data, demonstrating strong performance in cumulative rainfall forecasting and baseline-level event prediction capability.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Result: CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9% over direct baselines, with DPO providing additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: The framework advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of Visual Language Model (VLM) robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations, revealing that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to minor semantic-preserving changes like pixel shifts, geometric transformations, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite remarkable progress in VLMs, their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. The study aims to systematically evaluate VLM robustness to benign perturbations that don't alter underlying semantics.

Method: Conducted large-scale systematic study across multiple models and datasets, testing robustness to various perturbation types: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites. Analyzed how instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models.

Result: Modern VLMs are highly sensitive to minor perturbations - substantial fraction of samples change predicted answers under visual or textual modifications. Even state-of-the-art systems (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under small shifts or rephrasings. Sample-level stability strongly indicates correctness, and stability patterns of small open-source models can predict correctness of larger closed-source models with high precision.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit fundamental fragility to benign perturbations, highlighting the need for robustness evaluations that focus on invariances models should reliably uphold, going beyond adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing rigid one-to-one backdoor attacks in 3D domains like autonomous driving and robotics, where multi-target threats are critical for safety-sensitive applications.

Method: Leverage spatial properties of spheres as parameter space for configurable triggers, establishing theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks where distinct trigger configurations map to different target labels.

Result: Achieved high attack success rates (up to 100%) across multiple datasets and model architectures while maintaining accuracy on clean data, systematically validating the one-to-N backdoor concept.

Conclusion: Establishes crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems against sophisticated backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

TL;DR: MAFM^3 is a modular framework that enables a single foundation model to handle diverse medical imaging tasks and modalities through lightweight components, achieving improved performance on prognosis and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of data scarcity in medical imaging by allowing a single foundation model to expand into multiple domains, tasks, and modalities without requiring separate models for each.

Method: Uses lightweight modular components as specialized skill sets that can be flexibly activated at inference time based on input type or clinical objective, enabling unified multitask and multimodality adaptation.

Result: Improved performance on both prognosis and segmentation tasks, with PET scan integration achieving 5% improvement in Dice score compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models equipped with modular components can evolve beyond their initial training scope to become effective multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: GSD uses Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency supervision for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing overfitting in sparse view scenarios through depth warp and semantic feature guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from overfitting when trained with sparse views due to lack of intermediate-view supervision, requiring external priors for multi-view consistency.

Method: Proposes Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) that extracts multi-view consistency priors from pretrained Video Diffusion Models, using depth warp guidance and semantic feature guidance to correct noise predictions.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets by effectively leveraging VDM priors for improved 3D scene representation.

Conclusion: GSD successfully addresses 3DGS overfitting in sparse view scenarios by incorporating Video Diffusion Model priors with proper guidance mechanisms for multi-view consistency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: This paper investigates positional bias in multimodal representation models, finding it's prevalent in image-text retrieval tasks with text encoders biased toward input beginnings and image encoders biased at both beginnings and ends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While positional bias has been studied in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models, particularly multimodal models, remain underexplored despite potential negative impacts on model performance.

Method: The study distinguishes between context importance and positional bias, then assesses positional bias across different models and datasets in image-text retrieval tasks through systematic experiments.

Result: Experiments show positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders exhibit bias toward input beginnings, while image encoders show bias at both beginnings and ends.

Conclusion: Positional bias in multimodal models arises from or is amplified by a combination of factors including positional encoding schemes, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

TL;DR: DoReMi is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that jointly models domain-aware and unified representation branches to address multi-domain 3D point cloud learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ScanNet and S3DIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D deep learning generalization is limited by small datasets and heterogeneous multi-source point clouds from different sensors (LiDAR vs mesh-derived), causing negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Existing approaches overlook the synergy between domain-aware and domain-general features.

Method: Proposes DoReMi with Domain-aware Experts branch and unified Representation branch. Uses Domain-Guided Spatial Routing for context-aware expert selection and Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation for stable expert utilization. The unified branch is pretrained through multi-attribute self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DoReMi shows strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research by enabling cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge while preserving cross-domain geometric and structural priors.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: General image editing models often fail with new styles, and there's a need for efficient fine-tuning using limited paired data for style adaptation.

Method: Proposes MoE LoRA with dual routing mechanisms, automatic rank determination via metric-guided approach, optimal LoRA insertion in DiT model, and integration of adversarial learning and flow matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters on a benchmark dataset with five distinct styles.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses few-shot style editing by preventing style interference while learning common patterns, achieving superior performance with parameter efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE is a novel VLM architecture that addresses 3D spatial reasoning limitations by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation using two specialized modules: DRM for spatial co-processing and DRH for precise continuous regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with 3D spatial intelligence due to input-stage conflicts between geometric-aware encoders and 2D features, and output-stage misalignment where tokenizers can't produce precise continuous values.

Method: Introduces GEODE with two plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) for spatial co-processing via cross-attention and Rationale Tokens, and Direct Regression Head (DRH) using "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm for continuous regression.

Result: The 1.5B parameter model achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance rivaling 7B+ models, functioning as a high-level semantic dispatcher.

Conclusion: GEODE successfully breaks the dual-bottleneck in 3D spatial reasoning for VLMs through decoupled architecture design, enabling efficient and precise 3D understanding.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

*Jitesh Chavan,Rohit Lal,Anand Kamat,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee introduces a cross-block recurrent state chain that reuses terminal state-space representations between blocks in Mamba models, enabling better gradient flow and significantly improving performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba models for vision reinitialize state-space dynamics from zero at each block, discarding valuable terminal state information from previous blocks, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: Arcee creates a differentiable boundary map that passes each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block, maintaining gradient flow across boundaries.

Result: On CelebA-HQ 256×256 with Flow Matching, Arcee reduced FID from 82.81 to 15.33 (5.4× improvement) on a Zigzag Mamba baseline.

Conclusion: Arcee provides a parameter-free, compatible enhancement to vision Mamba variants that significantly improves performance by preserving cross-block state information.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer is a training-free method that improves text-to-image models' ability to follow numerical instructions by steering cross-attention hidden states during inference, based on the observation that models already encode latent numerical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic images but often fail to follow numerical instructions, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. However, models are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy through internal signal shifts.

Method: CountSteer steers the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference to guide generation more precisely, leveraging the model's latent notion of numerical correctness without requiring additional training.

Result: CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality in experiments.

Conclusion: CountSteer demonstrates a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation by harnessing models' existing numerical awareness.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

### [87] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language model that groups caption tokens to capture fine-grained language representations, aligning them with object-level image features for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models align image patches with individual tokens, but patches lack semantic meaning and tokens don't necessarily correspond to groundable image information. Groups of tokens better describe scene aspects.

Method: Proposed model groups caption tokens as part of its architecture to capture fine-grained language representations, aligning these representations with object-level outputs from an image encoder trained for object discovery.

Result: The model achieves better fine-grained understanding of vision and language through token grouping. The discovered token groups are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Learning to group tokens enables vision-language models to develop better fine-grained understanding, with discovered token groups closely matching groundable textual phrases.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphPilot, a method that enhances vision-language models for autonomous driving by conditioning them on traffic scene graphs during training to improve relational reasoning about spatial structures and dynamic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for autonomous driving lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies between traffic entities, limiting their ability to understand how agents influence each other from raw sensor data.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic approach that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context using traffic scene graphs at various abstraction levels, incorporated via structured prompt templates during training.

Result: Extensive evaluations on LangAuto benchmark show large improvements: up to 15.6% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver, with models better internalizing relational priors even without scene graph input at test-time.

Conclusion: Scene graph conditioning significantly enhances autonomous driving performance by enabling models to better understand and ground relational dependencies between traffic entities, demonstrating the value of explicit relational supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Φeat is a self-supervised visual backbone that learns physically-grounded representations sensitive to material identity rather than entangling semantics with physical factors like geometry and illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors (geometry, illumination), hindering physical reasoning tasks. There's a need for representations that capture material identity including reflectance and geometric mesostructure.

Method: Uses pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions, without explicit labels.

Result: Learned representations capture physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping, showing strong performance in feature similarity analysis and material selection tasks.

Conclusion: Unsupervised physical feature learning shows promise as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics, providing robust features invariant to external physical factors.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

*Haoyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL is a novel method for volumetric medical image segmentation that captures both local and global anatomical structure through contrastive ranking and ordinal objectives, achieving state-of-the-art performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use hard binary thresholds for contrastive learning, discarding continuous anatomical similarity information and overlooking global directional consistency of anatomical progression, leading to distorted feature spaces.

Method: CORAL uses a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity and an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, coordinatively learning inter-slice relationships to produce anatomically informed representations.

Result: CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: The coordinative learning framework of CORAL successfully captures both local and global anatomical structure, producing anatomically informed representations that benefit downstream segmentation tasks with limited annotations.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: The proposed simulation-free approach using low-frequency component stability provides a more robust and generalizable watermarking solution that doesn't require noise simulation training.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks.

Method: The dataset was generated using Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following BOP methodology, with simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage including background activity. The framework systematically evaluates event representations for CNN-based inference.

Result: Time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieved superior pose estimation performance, significantly outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D motion generation models rely on precise 3D supervision, which limits generalization beyond training distributions by encouraging coordinate fitting rather than learning essential 3D structure and motion semantics.

Method: Proposes Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) to map 2D motion sequences to 3D-consistent latent spaces, with 3D-free regularization objectives for view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility.

Result: Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing fully 3D-supervised methods despite using only 2D training data.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Motivation: Traditional segmentation approaches lack accuracy or speed, while supervised CNNs require large labeled datasets. Unsupervised methods suffer from slow segmentation and poor accuracy. There's a need for methods that combine unsupervised learning with fast segmentation.

Method: Integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, investigating different neighborhood terms and components for unsupervised HMRF loss. Uses HMRF-UNet architecture and proposes a pre-training strategy to reduce ground-truth data requirements.

Result: HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on Micro-CT images of Polyurethane foam structures. The pre-training strategy considerably reduces required ground-truth data for training segmentation models.

Conclusion: The proposed HMRF-UNet successfully combines unsupervised learning with fast segmentation, achieving high accuracy without ground truth and enabling reduced labeled data requirements through effective pre-training.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: LSEF is a hierarchical low-rank sparse framework that disentangles emotional bases and transient fluctuations to improve video affective computing robustness and dynamic discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based Affective Computing suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics, lacking mechanisms to disentangle hierarchical affective components.

Method: Proposes LSEF with three modules: Stability Encoding Module for low-rank emotional bases, Dynamic Decoupling Module for sparse transient signals, and Consistency Integration Module for multi-scale coherence, optimized by Rank Aware Optimization strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination in affective computing.

Conclusion: The hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling approach effectively addresses affective dynamics understanding, validating the framework's effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

*Manyu Li,Ruian He,Chenxi Ma,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroVQA++ is a high-quality microscopy VQA dataset created through a three-stage process: bootstrapping from expert-validated figure-caption pairs, filtering with HiCQA-Graph for cross-modal consistency, and human-screened MCQ generation. It enables 4B-scale MLLMs to achieve competitive microscopy reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for scientific reasoning in microscopy imaging, which limits the application of Multimodal Large Language Models in biomedical imaging.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Bootstrap supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs; 2) Apply HiCQA-Graph (heterogeneous graph over images, captions, QAs) with NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals for filtering; 3) Use MLLM agent to generate multiple-choice questions followed by human screening.

Result: Created a quality-controlled dataset with large training split and human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds MicroVQA benchmark. Enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance comparable to GPT-5 and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: Careful data construction through expert literature coupling, graph-based filtering, and human refinement enables smaller-scale MLLMs to achieve competitive microscopy reasoning, demonstrating the importance of high-quality dataset curation for specialized domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Doc is a three-tiered evaluation framework that systematically assesses Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) capabilities in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels, revealing their limitations and showing that Chain-of-Thought prompting improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored despite their advancement in other vision tasks.

Method: A three-tiered framework: coarse level (quality scoring correlation), middle level (distortion-type identification with single/multi-choice tests), and fine level (distortion-severity assessment against human references).

Result: MLLMs show nascent DIQA abilities but critical limitations including inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Chain-of-Thought prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in quality perception and identifying promising enhancement pathways through Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

### [100] [BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421)
*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA is a parameter-free CIL framework that adapts CLIP's bridge-layer using orthogonal low-rank fusion to prevent forgetting and employs cross-modal hybrid prototypes for enhanced classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying CLIP to CIL faces challenges: (1) additional learnable modules increase complexity and forgetting risk, (2) existing methods don't fully exploit multi-modal representations.

Method: BOFA confines adaptation to CLIP's bridge-layer using Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion to constrain updates to a low-rank safe subspace orthogonal to past tasks, and uses cross-modal hybrid prototypes combining stable textual and adapted visual features.

Result: Extensive experiments show BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: BOFA provides an effective parameter-free solution for CIL with CLIP by leveraging orthogonal fusion in the bridge-layer and cross-modal prototypes, enabling stable knowledge accumulation without data replay.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [101] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive teaching paradigm to address asymmetric alignment between vision and EEG modalities, achieving 60.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, surpassing previous methods by 9.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cross-modal alignment treats vision and EEG as equal partners, overlooking fundamental asymmetry characterized by Fidelity Gap (EEG's noise vs vision's high-fidelity) and Semantic Gap (EEG's shallow representation vs vision's rich semantics), leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes adaptive teaching paradigm where the teacher modality (vision) dynamically shrinks and adjusts its knowledge structure using ShrinkAdapter - a residual-free module with bottleneck structure - to match EEG's capacity under task guidance.

Result: Achieves 60.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 9.8% margin, validating the effectiveness of the asymmetric alignment approach.

Conclusion: The teacher modality must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap, introducing a new perspective for asymmetric alignment that addresses the fundamental fidelity and semantic gaps between modalities.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multilingual REC dataset spanning 10 languages and an attention-anchored neural architecture using multilingual SigLIP2 encoders, achieving competitive performance across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the English-centric nature of REC research despite increasing global deployment demands by developing multilingual capabilities.

Method: Constructed unified multilingual dataset by expanding 12 English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based enhancement; introduced attention-anchored architecture using multilingual SigLIP2 encoders that generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions and refines them through learned residuals.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation (vs 91.3% English-only); dataset comprises ~8M multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images with 336,882 annotated objects; consistent performance across 10 languages.

Conclusion: Establishes practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems with competitive performance across multiple languages.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

TL;DR: WEAVE is a comprehensive suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation, consisting of WEAVE-100k dataset (100K samples, 370K+ dialogue turns, 500K+ images) and WEAVEBench benchmark (100 tasks, 480 images) to address the gap in multi-turn, context-dependent visual creation and editing.

Motivation: Existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing, creating a gap in evaluating unified multimodal models.

Method: Developed WEAVE-100k dataset with 100K interleaved samples covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks requiring historical context reasoning, and WEAVEBench benchmark with human-annotated tasks and hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework.

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities, facilitating emergent visual-memory capabilities in UMMs. WEAVEBench evaluations expose persistent limitations in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

Conclusion: WEAVE provides a foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation, addressing the multi-turn, context-dependent challenges in multimodal AI and enabling better evaluation of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM is a brain-inspired diffusion framework that explicitly models cortical hierarchy to decode fMRI signals into images, achieving state-of-the-art semantic reconstruction while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based fMRI decoders overlook the brain's hierarchical visual processing, treating all cortical areas equally rather than accounting for their distinct functional roles in early, middle, and late visual processing.

Method: Uses ROI adapter to group fMRI into early/mid/late streams, creates multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth, and employs depth-matched ControlNet to inject scale-specific hints during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD).

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful framework for studying visual cortex organization.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VP-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to perceive and utilize visual prompts (like bounding boxes) in image understanding tasks, addressing the lack of systematic evaluation in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack systematic evaluation for interpreting visual prompts (VPs) like bounding boxes, which are intuitive for human users when querying specific image regions, creating a gap in understanding their VP recognition capabilities.

Method: Two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 assesses VP perception in natural scenes using 30k visualized prompts across 8 shapes and 355 attribute combinations; Stage 2 evaluates VP impact on downstream tasks in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 28 MLLMs (including GPT-4o, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-VL) revealed comprehensive insights into factors affecting VP understanding, including VP attribute variations, question arrangement, and model scale.

Conclusion: VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions, providing systematic evaluation of visual prompt interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using controlled synthetic data generation to fine-tune Vision-Language Models, addressing bias and imbalance issues in real-world data, and shows improved performance on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on real-world data often leads to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, causing overfitting and imbalanced performance. Existing synthetic data approaches lack control over distribution bias and annotation quality.

Method: Redesigns fine-tuning by: 1) Controlling synthetic data generation and annotations to eliminate bias, imbalance, and errors through comprehensive sampling of object attributes; 2) Fine-tuning state-of-the-art VLMs on this balanced synthetic dataset and evaluating transferability to real-world data on absolute position tasks.

Result: Two key findings: 1) Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across visual scenes and mitigates common biases; 2) Fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned on matched real data.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic data generation provides an effective solution to bias and imbalance problems in VLM fine-tuning, enabling better performance on real-world benchmarks than traditional real-data fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

TL;DR: Proposes MaMOL framework for robust multimodal classification with missing modalities using dual-routing mechanism and parameter-efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation from missing modalities in remote sensing due to environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects. Existing methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training.

Method: Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) reformulates modality missing as multi-task learning. Uses dual-routing: task-oriented dynamic router for missing patterns and modality-specific-shared static router for cross-modal knowledge sharing. Achieves parameter efficiency via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse.

Result: Superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates on multiple remote sensing benchmarks with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate scalability and cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: MaMOL provides a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning that outperforms existing methods while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Yijie Kang,Xinliang Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Yifeng Shi,Hailong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity is a novel framework for 3D urban generation from satellite imagery that addresses limitations of existing methods by using building-level generation, spatial priors from OSM data, appearance control mechanisms, and semantic-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D urban generation methods require costly large-scale 3D city assets and rely on semantic/height maps that lack real-world appearance connection, limiting realism and generalizability.

Method: The framework uses OSM-based spatial priors for geometric generation, appearance-guided controllable modeling for realism and style control, and MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation to bridge semantic interpretation with geometric reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation.

Conclusion: Sat2RealCity provides an effective solution for 3D urban generation from satellite imagery by reducing dependence on large-scale 3D assets and enabling realistic, appearance-controllable city generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction shows promise for scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: OpenUS is the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data, using a vision Mamba backbone and novel self-adaptive masking framework for enhanced pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound image interpretation is highly operator-dependent with significant variations across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types, hindering development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models.

Method: Uses vision Mamba backbone to capture local and global dependencies; introduces self-adaptive masking framework combining contrastive learning with masked image modeling; applies dynamic learning schedule; compiled largest public ultrasound dataset with 308K+ images from 42 datasets.

Result: Developed OpenUS foundation model that can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OpenUS provides a reproducible, open-source foundation model for ultrasound AI that addresses challenges in ultrasound image interpretation and enables generalizable, label-efficient model development.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

TL;DR: CVChess is a deep learning framework that converts smartphone images of physical chessboards into FEN notation using a CNN with residual layers, enabling digital chess assistance for analog games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The pandemic increased chess viewership through online platforms, but physical chess games lack equivalent digital assistance, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences.

Method: Uses a CNN with residual layers for piece recognition from smartphone images. Process includes: Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform for top-down alignment, segmentation into 64 squares, and classification into 13 classes (6 white pieces, 6 black pieces, empty square).

Result: Trained and evaluated on Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD) with 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse conditions. Residual connections improved accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The system successfully converts physical chessboard images to FEN notation, which can be fed into chess engines to provide optimal moves, bridging the gap between physical and digital chess experiences.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE proposes a lightweight cross-modal fusion module using bidirectional attention layers to align vision and text encoder hidden states, achieving strong performance on retrieval and reasoning tasks while maintaining bi-encoder efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fusion methods either mix tokens early or compare pooled embeddings late, but the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich modality-specific structure that can be directly aligned to match what vision and text "think".

Method: A few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders that project vision and text hidden states into shared space, attend across modalities, and send gated residual updates back with stabilizers for alignment.

Result: BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight fusion module effectively aligns modality-specific hidden states, enabling strong multimodal understanding without compromising encoder efficiency or requiring tight coupling with autoregressive decoders.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with evidence localization in long visual documents, failing to retrieve relevant pages and missing fine-grained details, which leads to limited performance and model hallucination.

Method: Proposes DocLens framework that first navigates from full documents to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate reliable answers.

Conclusion: DocLens demonstrates the power of enhanced localization capabilities for comprehending long visual documents, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of evidence localization that plagues existing approaches.

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization-based methods require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, while recent feedforward approaches produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on complex multi-stage pipelines.

Method: LARM extends LVSM for static 3D objects to articulated settings by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using transformer-based architecture, generating auxiliary outputs like depth maps and part masks for explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation.

Result: LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis, state synthesis, and 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to input images across diverse object categories.

Conclusion: The pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance in generating realistic 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images.

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Second Law of AI analogous to thermodynamics, showing that ethical entropy (divergence from intended goals) increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work, and provides a quantitative framework for maintaining AI stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for AI alignment by drawing analogies with thermodynamics, providing quantitative measures for ethical drift and stability boundaries in autonomous systems.

Method: Defined ethical entropy S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta) over goals, proved dS/dt >= 0, derived critical alignment work boundary gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, and validated through simulations with 7-billion-parameter models.

Result: Unconstrained 7B-parameter model drifted from entropy 0.32 to 1.69 ± 1.08 nats, while regularized system with gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintained stability at 0.00 ± 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 × 10^-17).

Conclusion: AI alignment should be treated as a continuous thermodynamic control problem, with the proposed framework providing quantitative foundations for maintaining stability and safety in advanced autonomous systems.

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-EPG is a self-iterative training framework that enables co-evolution of planning and grounding capabilities for GUI agents through an iterative positive feedback loop, outperforming SOTA methods without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI automation methods have limitations: insufficient cross-model synergies and over-reliance on synthetic data without sufficient utilization. There's a need for better integration of planning and grounding capabilities.

Method: Co-EPG establishes an iterative feedback loop where the planning model explores strategies under grounding-based rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. The optimized grounding model then provides better rewards for subsequent planning model training.

Result: On Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, Co-EPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Conclusion: This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach that enables iterative enhancement through self-play optimization and training data distillation.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

TL;DR: The paper reframes Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, conducts axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, introduces a new measure called directed coverage, analyzes computational complexity, and shows experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce cognitive load on decision makers in multi-objective optimization by computing a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, addressing unintuitive behaviors in existing quality measures.

Method: Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, conducting axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, introducing a new measure (directed coverage), analyzing computational complexity, and performing experimental evaluation.

Result: Uncovered unintuitive behaviors in existing quality measures, identified computational complexity boundaries, and showed that the proposed directed coverage measure performs competitively or favorably across various settings.

Conclusion: The choice of quality measure significantly impacts the characteristics of selected solution sets, and the proposed directed coverage measure offers improved performance in Pareto pruning for multi-objective optimization problems.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents novel reductions from abstract argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width, establishing efficient encodings for dense graphs where treewidth-based approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand encoding capabilities with clique-width for computational problems, particularly in abstract argumentation, since clique-width can be small for dense graphs unlike treewidth, and little is known about encodings for clique-width despite available algorithms.

Method: Design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions.

Result: Established novel results for all argumentation semantics including counting, with reductions that cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper initiates the study of clique-width-based encodings for computational problems, providing efficient reductions for abstract argumentation that work well on dense graphs where traditional treewidth approaches are limited.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new counterfactual decision-making metrics - Probability of Potential Outcome Ranking (PoR) and Probability of achieving the Best potential outcome (PoB) - for ranking actions based on causal reasoning under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-makers need better tools to compare candidate actions by ranking expected potential outcomes, utilities, and desirability in counterfactual decision-making scenarios with uncertainty.

Method: The authors establish identification theorems and derive bounds for PoR and PoB metrics, then present estimation methods for these metrics.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators, and the methods are applied to a real-world dataset to show practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed PoR and PoB metrics provide new counterfactual decision-making rules that help identify the most probable outcome rankings and actions most likely to yield top-ranked outcomes for individuals.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey reframes reasoning in LLMs through adaptivity - the ability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics like difficulty and uncertainty, addressing the limitation of uniform reasoning strategies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive reasoning approaches.

Method: The paper formalizes deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in LLMs, frames adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem, and proposes a taxonomy organizing methods into training-based (reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, learned controllers) and training-free approaches (prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, modular composition).

Result: A systematic framework that clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control for future research in adaptive reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge graph embedding methods have limitations: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle diverse relationship types effectively at scale.

Method: A hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. Uses relation-specific space weighting to dynamically select optimal geometries for each relation type, and employs multi-space consistency loss to ensure coherent predictions across spaces.

Demonstrated consistent improvements over TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE across computer science research knowledge graphs from 1K to 10M papers.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx provides an effective solution for scalable knowledge graph embeddings by adaptively combining multiple geometric spaces, achieving superior performance while maintaining efficiency and near-linear scalability with graph size.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional planning units like census tracts lack flexibility and don't capture local community demands for effective hazard prevention and response strategies.

Method: Built on representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM) with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, using AI agents to guide feature selection, spatial constraints, and interactive exploration.

Result: The platform enables users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively for disaster planning, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Conclusion: The system successfully integrates human-in-the-loop principles with AI agents to create flexible, demand-oriented planning units that better serve disaster planning needs compared to conventional static boundaries.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

*Tiantian He,An Zhao,Elinor Thompson,Anna Schroder,Ahmed Abdulaal,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance learning of Alzheimer's disease progression from longitudinal data, addressing limitations in current methods that oversimplify brain connectivity and face identifiability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling neurodegenerative disease progression oversimplify brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality connectome, leading to inaccurate predictions. Data-driven approaches face identifiability issues due to lack of proper constraints.

Method: Uses LLMs as expert guides on regional variable interactions to learn disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal data. LLMs synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms to simultaneously optimize disease trajectories and biologically-constrained graph structures.

Result: Demonstrated on tau-PET imaging data from Alzheimer's disease cohort, showing superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches, while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Conclusion: The LLM-enhanced framework provides a more accurate and interpretable approach for modeling neurodegenerative disease progression by leveraging multi-modal relationships and addressing identifiability challenges in graph learning.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is critical under stringent privacy regulations like Japan's APPI, requiring trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Method: Multi-agent system that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol.

Result: 72% accuracy on 200 APPI Article 16 cases (21 percentage points higher than single-agent baseline), with 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases and perfect detection of clear violations.

Conclusion: Domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

*Steven J. Jones,Robert E. Wray,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous AI systems need to construct and evaluate multiple courses of action when facing novel scenarios where no single option fully satisfies all constraints, requiring integration of normative, pragmatic, and situational knowledge for robust decision-making aligned with human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployed autonomous AI systems inevitably encounter novel scenarios where trained policies are insufficient, requiring them to construct and justify courses of action that align with human expectations and values despite operational constraints.

Method: The paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making through analysis and empirical case studies, examining how agents integrate normative (rules/laws/norms), pragmatic (operational feasibility), and situational (contextual) understanding.

Result: The research identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations in complex, real-world environments.

Conclusion: For autonomous AI systems to achieve goals in accordance with human values, they must go beyond trained policies and construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action by integrating multiple types of contextual knowledge.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of e-commerce creates vast unstructured product data, making information retrieval and analytics challenging. Manual construction of product knowledge graphs is complex and time-consuming.

Method: A three-stage agent-based approach using LLMs: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. The framework operates without predefined schemas or handcrafted rules.

Result: Evaluation on air conditioner product descriptions showed over 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population.

Conclusion: The framework validates the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable solution for intelligent product data integration.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [130] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new incomplete symmetry-breaking method for abstract structures in constraint programming that exploits their representations, showing improved performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstract structures in high-level modeling languages need representation transformations for solving, and traditional symmetry-breaking techniques produce complex constraints that perform poorly when applied to abstract variables.

Method: New incomplete symmetry-breaking method that better exploits the representations of abstract structures, specifically applied to symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects.

Result: The proposed method is faster than previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025) for breaking symmetries of abstract structures.

Conclusion: The new incomplete symmetry-breaking approach effectively handles symmetries in abstract structures by leveraging their representations, offering practical performance improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADC, a strategy that improves Multi-Agent Debate performance by optimizing role allocation and using path consistency to simulate truth, achieving up to 22% improvement in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multi-Agent Debate approaches lack exploration of role allocation strategies, which significantly impact reasoning performance. The challenge of unknown truth in practical applications also needs addressing.

Method: Proposes Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy that uses path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles and simulates the role with highest consistency as truth. Validated across 9 LLM models.

Result: MADC improved MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks, consistently outperformed baseline methods, and effectively overcame MAD's performance bottlenecks across various LLMs.

Conclusion: MADC provides a crucial pathway for LLM agent scaling improvements by systematically optimizing role allocation and truth simulation mechanisms in multi-agent debates.

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

TL;DR: DSS is a planning framework that uses differentiable simulation (Waymax) for autonomous driving, combining planning gradients and stochastic search to optimize action sequences through gradient descent over imagined trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning is crucial for safe autonomous driving to avoid collisions in complex traffic. Traditional search-based planning is challenging when all components (policy, predictor, critic) need to be learned.

Method: Uses differentiable simulator Waymax as both next-state predictor and critic, leveraging hardcoded dynamics for accurate predictions and differentiability for effective action sequence search. Optimizes actions via gradient descent over imagined trajectories.

Result: DSS significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: The combination of planning gradients and stochastic search in DSS provides superior planning performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time and misses intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: Collected via O2ARC web interface with 10,000 trajectories across 400 training tasks, using object-level actions to capture human reasoning steps. Defines a unified reasoning pipeline with data collection, action abstraction, MDP formulation, and integration with various learning methods.

Result: Provides structured trajectories with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels. Analysis reveals patterns in spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence in human reasoning.

Conclusion: ARCTraj serves as a structured foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence through interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

TL;DR: A novel method for generalised planning that learns first-order Condition→Actions rules from optimal plans for training problems, which can be executed directly or used to prune planning search space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple yet effective approach for synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems, improving upon existing generalised planning methods.

Method: For each training problem, compute optimal plans for goal atoms in order, perform goal regression on resulting plans, and lift outputs to obtain first-order Condition→Actions rules that form a generalised plan.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art planners in synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality across classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: The method successfully learns valid generalised plans and pruning axioms, demonstrating practical effectiveness in various planning scenarios.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

TL;DR: GGBench is a new benchmark for evaluating geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models, addressing the gap in assessing integrated cognitive processes of understanding and construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning in UMMs, focusing only on discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately.

Method: Proposed geometric construction as an ideal testbed that inherently demands fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation, and developed GGBench benchmark.

Result: Created a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing models' ability to understand, reason, and actively construct solutions in geometric contexts.

Conclusion: GGBench sets a more rigorous standard for evaluating the next generation of intelligent systems by measuring integrated generative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

*Dayong Liang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Changmeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG), a protocol that improves multimodal reasoning in LLMs by detecting hallucinating agents through counterfactual testing with modified images, moving beyond traditional consensus-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) which assumes all agents are rational and reflective, when in reality agents can suffer from hallucinations, leading to unreliable reasoning outcomes.

Method: MUG protocol inspired by social deduction games, using multimodal counterfactual tests where reference images are modified to introduce counterfactual evidence, allowing detection of hallucinating agents through their inability to identify these changes.

Result: MUG advances MAD protocols by enabling factual verification through counterfactual testing, introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence, and fostering active reasoning through probing discussions rather than passive question-answering.

Conclusion: MUG provides a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs by detecting hallucinating agents through counterfactual evidence testing, offering improvements over traditional consensus-based approaches.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

TL;DR: STaR is a framework that enhances table reasoning in LLMs by incorporating slow-thinking capabilities through step-by-step reasoning and uncertainty-aware inference, achieving superior performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table reasoning methods with LLMs lack depth and iterative refinement like human cognition, and exhibit instability that compromises reliability in applications.

Method: STaR uses two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning during training (learning from simple to complex queries) and performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification during inference by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability on benchmarks, with strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: STaR demonstrates potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs, providing more credible reasoning paths through slow-thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

### [140] [A Workflow for Full Traceability of AI Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11275)
*Julius Wenzel,Syeda Umaima Alam,Andreas Schmidt,Hanwei Zhang,Holger Hermanns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a workflow for generating tamper-proof, verifiable traces of AI decisions by documenting every component in training and inference processes, using confidential computing technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack proper documentation of decision processes, creating risks of harm to people and obstructing accountability when AI decisions violate laws or human rights.

Method: Expands the DBOM concept into a running workflow that enforces documentation of all components in AI training and inference, leveraging confidential computing technology to create tamper-proof traces.

Result: Developed the first running workflow supporting generation of verifiable, exhaustive AI decision traces, demonstrated through a mushroom classification app as an example of high-stake decision support.

Conclusion: The approach provides practical traceability for AI decisions, enabling reconstruction of responsibility chains and documentation that can stand up in legal proceedings when AI systems cause harm.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

*Patrick Koopmann,Yasir Mahmood,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,Balram Tiwari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces contrastive ABox explanations to answer "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?" by considering both positive and missing entailments simultaneously, focusing on relevant commonalities and differences between instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches explain positive entailments or missing entailments in isolation, but contrastive explanations address both simultaneously to provide more focused insights into why one instance belongs to a concept while another does not.

Method: Developed a notion of contrastive explanations for ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, analyzed computational complexity for different variants under optimality criteria across lightweight and expressive description logics, and implemented a method for computing one variant.

Result: Implemented a first method for computing contrastive explanations and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases, demonstrating practical feasibility.

Conclusion: Contrastive ABox explanations provide a novel approach that simultaneously considers both positive and missing entailments, offering more focused explanations by highlighting relevant commonalities and differences between instances, with computational complexity analyzed and initial implementation validated.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

*Ruoxi Cheng,Haoxuan Ma,Teng Ma,Hongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign is an inference-time framework that treats LVLM alignment as an economically rational search problem, using forward-looking cost-benefit analysis to balance safety, utility, and computational costs while preventing deceptive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM alignment methods struggle with trade-offs between safety, utility, and operational costs, and suffer from process-blindness that wastes computational budget on unsafe deliberation while allowing harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications.

Method: EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against remaining budget, with path safety enforced via the weakest-link principle.

Result: Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: EcoAlign offers a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment by reframing alignment as an economically rational search problem that treats LVLMs as boundedly rational agents.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

*Yitian Kou,Yihe Gu,Chen Zhou,DanDan Zhu,Shuguang Kuai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLSLM is a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that combines rule-based social locomotion models with data-driven learning to enable socially-aware navigation that balances mechanical efficiency and human comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable but inflexible rule-based approaches and powerful but opaque data-driven methods for social navigation, creating agents that can navigate human environments without causing discomfort.

Method: Integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model (grounded in empirical behavioral experiments) into RL reward functions, generating orientation-sensitive social comfort fields that quantify human comfort across space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience, achieves socially aligned navigation with minimal training, and shows significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Conclusion: RLSLM presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation, enabling agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MarsRL is a reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism that improves multi-agent reasoning systems by jointly optimizing all agents, achieving significant accuracy gains on AIME2025 and BeyondAIME benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent reasoning systems work well with closed-source models but struggle with open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities, and limited output length constrains reasoning depth in single inference.

Method: Proposes MarsRL framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, agent-specific reward mechanisms to reduce reward noise, and pipeline-inspired training for efficient long trajectory handling.

Result: Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, improved AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.

Conclusion: MarsRL demonstrates strong potential to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey reviews robust communication strategies for multi-agent reinforcement learning under real-world constraints like message perturbations, delays, and bandwidth limits, focusing on applications in autonomous driving, SLAM, and federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MARL approaches assume ideal communication (instantaneous, reliable, unlimited bandwidth), but real-world deployments face practical constraints that need to be addressed.

Method: Systematic review of recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL, analyzing approaches that handle realistic constraints including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth.

Result: The survey identifies key challenges and solutions for practical MARL systems, with focus on three application domains: cooperative autonomous driving, distributed SLAM, and federated learning.

Conclusion: Advocates for a unified co-design approach that integrates communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations, identifying key open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

TL;DR: CURENet is a multimodal model that integrates clinical notes, lab tests, and time-series visit data using LLMs and transformers to predict chronic diseases with over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most predictive models fail to capture interactions and temporal patterns across multiple EHR data modalities, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive patient health views for clinical decision-making.

Method: CURENet combines LLMs for processing clinical text and lab tests with transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits, integrating unstructured notes, structured lab tests, and time-series data.

Result: The model achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting top 10 chronic conditions on both MIMIC-III and FEMH datasets in a multi-label framework.

Conclusion: Multimodal EHR integration through CURENet demonstrates significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes by better capturing complex data interactions.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

*Adam Stein,Matthew Trager,Benjamin Bowman,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGuR is an AI system that dynamically generates complete computational strategies at inference time using accumulated experience, enabling flexible adaptation of prompts, sampling parameters, tools, and control logic without requiring offline optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems either only modify textual inputs (limiting adaptation) or require offline optimization (remaining static after deployment), creating a need for systems that can dynamically adapt all strategy components during inference.

Method: EGuR uses an LLM-based meta-strategy with two components: a Guide that generates candidate strategies based on current problems and past experiences, and a Consolidator that integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation.

Result: Across five challenging benchmarks, EGuR achieved up to 14% accuracy improvements over strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Conclusion: EGuR enables dynamic, experience-guided strategy generation at inference time, providing significant performance improvements and computational efficiency gains while maintaining adaptability across diverse problem domains.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes test-time alignment technique using model-guided policy shaping to control behavioral attributes in pre-trained RL agents, enabling ethical alignment without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of maintaining AI agent alignment with human values in complex environments, particularly for pre-trained agents where retraining is costly.

Method: Model-guided policy shaping applied at test time using scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure ethical decision alignment in text-based game environments.

Result: Effective mitigation of unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes, outperforming prior training-time methods.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping provides scalable solution for ethical alignment of pre-trained agents without requiring retraining.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

TL;DR: AFA is a lightweight trainable pooling mechanism that learns to attend to task-relevant visual cues while ignoring distractors, improving visuomotor policy robustness against visual perturbations without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or PVR fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) can encode task-irrelevant scene information, making visuomotor policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors.

Method: Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA) - a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues while ignoring semantically rich scene distractors.

Result: Policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, as demonstrated through extensive experiments in both simulation and real world.

Conclusion: Ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalizable visuomotor policies.

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

Conclusion: Demonstrates implementation of ethical frameworks in practice, contributes to trustworthy social robot development, and provides reusable open-source templates to lower entry barrier for researchers.

Abstract: As social robots increasingly enter public environments, their acceptance depends not only on technical reliability but also on ethical integrity, accessibility, and user trust. This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers. By combining user perspectives with practical technical resources, this work contributes to ongoing discussions in AI and society and supports the development of trustworthy, inclusive, and ethically responsible social robots for public spaces.

*Eric Mugford,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents A^SAR, an ε-optimal search algorithm for Search and Rescue planning that provides formal guarantees on solution quality and outperforms existing methods in simulations and real-world field trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search and Rescue operations face complex optimization problems with uncertain information and large search areas. Traditional stochastic methods lack formal guarantees on solution quality, which is critical when survival times are short (e.g., in Maritime SAR).

Method: The A^SAR algorithm calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor ε of the optimal solution.

Result: A^SAR finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. In a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, it located a drifting manikin in only 150 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed A^SAR algorithm provides ε-optimal solutions with formal guarantees, making it more reliable and effective than stochastic methods for time-critical Search and Rescue operations.

Abstract: Searches are conducted to find missing persons and/or objects given uncertain information, imperfect observers and large search areas in Search and Rescue (SAR). In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.
  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.
  This paper instead presents $\rm{A}^{\rm{SAR}}$, an $\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. It is also demonstrated with a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, Canada, where it was used to locate a drifting manikin in only 150s.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg using a five-bar linkage design that can mechanically switch between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations for search and rescue applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search and rescue robots need both terrain adaptability and high-force output capabilities, but existing platforms struggle to combine these features - legged robots handle terrain well but lack high-force mechanisms, while wheeled systems have force output but poor terrain adaptability.

Method: Developed a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage leg design that enables geometric transformation between configurations. Built a testbed to evaluate performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, conducting empirical and analytical analyses on stride length, force output, and stability.

Result: The morphing leg demonstrated the ability to switch between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations, showing promising performance in both terrain navigation and force output capabilities.

Conclusion: The dynamically extensible and retractable leg concept offers a viable approach for developing search and rescue robots that can effectively navigate challenging terrain while performing high-force rescue tasks.

Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.

Result: 9.3% reduction in computation time and 13.1% reduction in travel time over baselines with 100% success rate in simulation; successful high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in cluttered environments and long-duration flights with dynamic obstacles in hardware.

Conclusion: MIGHTY overcomes limitations of existing methods by performing joint spatiotemporal optimization in continuous spline space, demonstrating superior performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Hard-constraint trajectory planners often rely on commercial solvers and demand substantial computational resources. Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a decentralized approach for emergent multi-agent behavior that requires minimal information sharing and eliminates the need for velocity inputs, building on prior work in simple orbits.

Method: Stabilizes system around Lie group SO(3) geometric embedding, uses SO(3) properties to work with position-only inputs, and implements a novel phase controller for uniform agent separation with formal stability proof.

Result: The method generates a broader class of stable periodic trajectories than quaternion-based approaches, adapts to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances, and maintains uniform agent spacing.

Conclusion: The SO(3)-based approach successfully enables decentralized multi-agent coordination with minimal information requirements, providing formal guarantees and practical robustness.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel decentralized approach for achieving emergent behavior in multi-agent systems with minimal information sharing. Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances.

*Yorai Shaoul,Zhe Chen,Mohamed Naveed Gul Mohamed,Federico Pecora,Maxim Likhachev,Jiaoyang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified framework for multi-robot multi-object manipulation that combines flow-matching co-generation with anonymous motion planning to handle complex cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either learn entire tasks or rely on hand-designed planners, both struggling with diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. Need integrated solution for scalable collaborative manipulation.

Method: Integrates flow-matching co-generation (contact formations + manipulation trajectories from visual observations) with anonymous multi-robot motion planning that supports both robot and object-level coordination.

Result: Outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks in challenging simulated environments, demonstrating benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning.

Conclusion: The framework successfully scales collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings by unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework.

Abstract: Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

### [158] [Terradynamics and design of tip-extending robotic anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10901)
*Deniz Kerimoglu,Nicholas D. Naclerio,Sean Chu,Andrew Krohn,Vineet Kupunaram,Alexander Schepelmann,Daniel I. Goldman,Elliot W. Hawkes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a bio-inspired robotic anchor that mimics tree root insertion through tip extension, achieving much higher extraction than insertion forces using lightweight design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pilings require heavy equipment for insertion but have low extraction resistance, making them unsuitable for hard-to-access or extraterrestrial sites. Tree roots demonstrate the opposite behavior - easy insertion with high extraction resistance.

Method: Studied terradynamics of tip-extending anchors vs traditional pilings, identified four key design principles, and developed a soft robotic anchor that implements these insights.

Result: Created a 300g device that inserts with less than its own weight force, anchors with 120N average force in Martian regolith simulant, achieving 40:1 anchoring-to-weight ratio.

Conclusion: The root-inspired tip-extension mechanism enables lightweight anchoring with high extraction resistance, making it suitable for challenging environments including extraterrestrial applications.

Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.

TL;DR: A hand-agnostic system that transfers human hand manipulation from videos to dexterous robot hands using progressive transfer framework, achieving 73% success rate without massive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in dexterous manipulation research caused by difficulty in collecting real robot manipulation data, by leveraging readily available human demonstration videos.

Method: Progressive transfer framework: 1) Kinematic matching for primary control, 2) Residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization for contact optimization, 3) Wrist trajectory computation for semantic preservation.

Result: Achieves 73% average transfer success rate, generates smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions with high efficiency and strong generalizability.

Conclusion: Provides an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data using only human hand manipulation videos, automatically configuring parameters for different tasks and hand types.

Abstract: The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordination of robotic swarms is computationally complex and challenged by physical system limitations like measurement errors and control dynamics, making optimal path determination an open problem.

Method: Geometric formulations mapped to physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques for seamless configuration transitions.

Result: The algorithm enables seamless transition from one configuration to another in robotic swarms.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Abstract: Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LS-NWM is a lightweight latent space navigation world model that operates entirely in latent space, reducing training time by 3.2x and planning time by 447x while improving navigation performance with 35% higher SR and 11% higher SPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation methods rely on accurate localization and mapping, while world models offer new perspectives but suffer from high computational costs. The paper aims to address the computational inefficiency of world models in navigation tasks.

Method: Proposes LS-NWM that trains and operates entirely in latent space, predicting future latent states from current observations and actions, then performing planning in this compact representation. Uses autoregressive multi-frame prediction to capture long-term spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves 3.2x faster training and 447x faster planning compared to baseline, with 35% higher success rate (SR) and 11% higher SPL (success weighted by path length). Demonstrates state-of-the-art navigation performance with substantial efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: The method proves that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation, and that operating in latent space enables both superior performance and significant computational efficiency gains, making world models more practical for real-world navigation applications.

Abstract: Traditional navigation methods rely heavily on accurate localization and mapping. In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous driving, which extends vehicle autonomy by enabling real-time collaboration between vehicles and smart roadside infrastructure, remains a challenging yet essential problem. However, none of the existing testbeds employ smart infrastructure equipped with sensing, edge computing, and communication capabilities. To address this gap, we design and implement a 1:15-scale miniature testbed, CIVAT, for validating cooperative autonomous driving, consisting of a scaled urban map, autonomous vehicles with onboard sensors, and smart infrastructure. The proposed testbed integrates V2V and V2I communication with the publish-subscribe pattern through a shared Wi-Fi and ROS2 framework, enabling information exchange between vehicles and infrastructure to realize cooperative driving functionality.

TL;DR: AdaptPNP is a VLM-based framework that systematically combines prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation skills for robust robotic task planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation expands robotic capabilities when grasping is infeasible, but integrating P&NP actions into unified frameworks that generalize across tasks remains challenging.

Method: Uses VLM to interpret scenes and tasks, generates high-level plans, employs digital-twin object-centric layer for mental rehearsal, and control module with continuous feedback for adaptive replanning.

Result: Evaluated across hybrid P&NP tasks in simulation and real-world, showing potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: Hybrid P&NP manipulation represents a crucial step toward achieving human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning pipeline trains humanoid robots to play badminton with coordinated whole-body movements, achieving dynamic hitting without motion priors or demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are dynamic, requiring robots to move beyond quasi-static interactions. Badminton serves as a challenging test case for dynamic whole-body coordination.

Method: Three-stage RL curriculum: footwork acquisition, precision racket swing generation, and task refinement. Uses EKF for shuttlecock trajectory prediction and a prediction-free variant.

Result: Simulation: 21-hit rallies sustained. Real-world: shuttle speeds up to 10 m/s with mean return distance of 3.5m. Prediction-free variant performs comparably to target-known policy.

Conclusion: Humanoid robots can achieve highly dynamic and precise goal striking in badminton, demonstrating potential for adaptation to other dynamism-critical domains.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.

Method: Established a standardized evaluation framework testing four VLA models across four manipulation tasks in simulation and on ALOHA Mobile platform, measuring accuracy/efficiency, adaptability across different settings, and language instruction-following accuracy.

Result: π₀ showed superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while ACT provided highest stability in-distribution. Analysis revealed differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and common failure modes like near-miss grasps and premature releases.

Conclusion: The findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, providing actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift.

SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.

TL;DR: LIBERO-Mem is a non-Markovian task suite for robotic manipulation that requires tracking objects over time. Embodied-SlotSSM is proposed as a scalable vision-language-action framework using slot-state-space modeling and relational encoding to handle temporal reasoning in object-centric policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need to track and reason about individual object instances over time in complex environments, especially when key decision cues are hidden in object histories rather than current scenes. Without persistent memory of prior interactions, visuomotor policies may fail in non-Markovian settings.

Method: Embodied-SlotSSM uses slot-centric vision-language-action framework with two key mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align input tokens with action decoding. This maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities for temporal scalability.

Result: Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM achieves baseline performance on both LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-Markovian reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: Embodied-SlotSSM offers a scalable solution for temporal reasoning in object-centric robotic policies, addressing the challenges of non-Markovian settings where traditional vision-language-action models struggle with token scaling issues.

Abstract: As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.

Result: Developed a structured pipeline for autonomous vehicle certification that identifies specific stages, stakeholders, and appropriate verification methods for different aspects of vehicle safety.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic framework for autonomous vehicle certification under Vision Zero, addressing the gap in verification methods and establishing a clear process for safety validation.

Abstract: The "Vision Zero" policy, introduced by the Swedish Parliament in 1997, aims to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic accidents. To achieve this goal, the use of self-driving vehicles in traffic is envisioned and a roadmap for the certification of self-driving vehicles is aimed to be determined. However, it is still unclear how the basic safety requirements that autonomous vehicles must meet will be verified and certified, and which methods will be used. This paper focuses on the comparative evaluation of the prominent methods planned to be used in the certification process of autonomous vehicles. It examines the prominent methods used in the certification process, develops a pipeline for the certification process of autonomous vehicles, and determines the stages, actors, and areas where the addressed methods can be applied.

TL;DR: TLV-CoRe is a CLIP-based multimodal learning method that unifies tactile, language, and vision representations through sensor-aware modulation, tactile-irrelevant decoupling, and unified bridging adapters, achieving improved cross-sensor generalization and multimodal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tactile sensors lack standardization, creating redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Current methods also fail to fully integrate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities.

Method: Proposes TLV-CoRe with: 1) Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors, 2) tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant features, and 3) Unified Bridging Adapter to enhance tri-modal interaction in shared representation space.

Result: Experimental results show TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Also introduces RSS evaluation framework (Robustness, Synergy, Stability) for fair tactile model assessment.

Conclusion: TLV-CoRe offers a new direction for multimodal tactile representation learning, effectively addressing cross-sensor generalization challenges and enhancing tri-modal integration.

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper formulates coverage motion planning as a statistical inference problem using flow matching, unifying discrepancy measures with LQR problems and enabling GPU acceleration for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coverage motion planning requires reasoning over spatial distribution of trajectories, making conventional methods computationally inefficient and less parallelizable.

Method: Formulate coverage motion planning as statistical inference using flow matching, decoupling trajectory gradient generation from control synthesis under nonlinear dynamics.

Result: The proposed method enables significant acceleration through parallelization on GPUs, offering computational benefits over conventional waypoint tracking methods.

Conclusion: The flow matching formulation provides scalable coverage motion planning with improved computational efficiency through modern parallelization frameworks.

Abstract: Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.

TL;DR: Using action-conditional video generation models as scalable world models for evaluating robotic manipulation policies without real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world testing of robotic policies is expensive, time-consuming, and risky, while simulation environments require significant engineering effort and suffer from sim-to-real gaps.

Method: Incorporate action conditioning into pre-trained video generation models, leveraging internet-scale videos during pre-training to avoid expensive paired video-action data collection.

Result: Models show promising results across various metrics including policy ranking and correlation between actual and predicted policy values.

Conclusion: Action-conditional video generation models offer a viable approach for evaluating robotic policies without requiring real-world interactions.

Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.

*Luisa Mao,Garret Warnell,Peter Stone,Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPACER is a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that combines generalization to new terrains using synthetic data with rapid test-time adaptation through user-specified preference conditioning, outperforming existing methods in off-road navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing costmap generation methods either allow rapid test-time adaptation (semantic segmentation) or generalization to new terrain types (representation learning), but not both. Autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires both capabilities to generate high-quality terrain costmaps.

Method: SPACER uses synthetic data during training for generalization and conditions costmap generation on user-specified scaled preference context for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs.

Result: SPACER outperforms other approaches with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning, using large-scale aerial maps.

Conclusion: SPACER successfully addresses the dual challenge of generalization and rapid adaptation in terrain costmap generation, providing superior performance for autonomous off-road navigation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Successful autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires the ability to generate high-quality terrain costmaps that are able to both generalize well over a wide variety of terrains and rapidly adapt relative costs at test time to meet mission-specific needs. Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new ergodic control formulation that uses volumetric state representation instead of point-based modeling, improving coverage efficiency by 2x while maintaining 100% task completion across various robot dynamics and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ergodic control methods model robots as non-volumetric points, but in practice robots interact with environments through their physical volume (body, sensors, end-effectors), creating a gap between theory and real-world applications.

Method: Introduces volumetric ergodic control that optimizes spatial coverage using volumetric state representation, preserves asymptotic coverage guarantees, adds minimal computational overhead, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models.

Result: The method improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining 100% task completion rate across all experiments with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries/sensor models, outperforming standard ergodic control.

Conclusion: The volumetric ergodic control formulation effectively bridges the gap between theoretical point-based models and practical volumetric robot interactions, demonstrating superior performance in real-world tasks like mechanical erasing while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.
