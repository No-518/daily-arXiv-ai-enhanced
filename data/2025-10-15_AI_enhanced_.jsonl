Existing approaches,\nsuch as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search\nequipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and\npoorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct\nextensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results\nand provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches with dynamic query crafting for both image and text search, using a two-stage training pipeline with reinforcement learning optimization.", "motivation": "Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes for real-world information-seeking tasks.", "method": "Two-stage training pipeline: cold start supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning optimization, using a novel multimodal VQA dataset (DeepMMSearchVQA) with automated pipeline and real-world web search information.", "result": "Extensive experiments across knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate superiority of the approach, with the model effectively learning when to search, what to search for, which tool to use, and how to reason over retrieved information.", "conclusion": "DeepMMSearch-R1 advances multimodal web-search capabilities by enabling dynamic query crafting, self-reflection, and self-correction, providing valuable insights for future multimodal web-search research."}}
