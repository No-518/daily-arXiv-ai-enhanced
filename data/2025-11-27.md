### [1] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to enhance privacy resilience in multi-modal vision-language models against membership inference attacks, showing 24% reduction in attack success while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal models introduce new privacy attack vectors, but current research focuses mainly on unimodal systems. While neuro-inspired approaches improve adversarial resilience in unimodal models, their effectiveness against privacy attacks in multi-modal models remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed a topological regularization (tau) framework applied to three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) across three datasets (COCO, CC3M, NoCaps). The tau > 0 configuration defines NEURO variants of VLMs.

Result: NEURO VLMs showed 24% mean ROC-AUC drop in MIA attack success on BLIP with COCO dataset while maintaining similar model utility (MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics). Results were consistent across all models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired VLMs are more resilient against privacy attacks without significantly compromising model utility, contributing to understanding privacy risks in multi-modal models.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine designed for world models, enabling immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding with interactive video streaming and LV-Bench integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are core simulators for AI fields that can generate realistic, interactive videos and potentially unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception and reasoning, moving beyond current LLM-centric vision models.

Method: Uses semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding that combines diffusion and autoregressive methods, generating video tokens in blocks with diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones. Features LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient variable-length generation, interactive video streaming, and LV-Bench integration.

Result: Enables more coherent and stable video sequences, overcoming limitations of standard video diffusion models. Supports efficient, variable-length, high-quality video generation with real-time interaction capabilities.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a dedicated world simulation engine distinct from high-concurrency systems and classic video diffusion models, with the goal of advancing world model exploration through community collaboration.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTED-Ada is a hybrid video object recognition system that uses deep reinforcement learning to adaptively choose between local tracking and edge detection, with federated learning for multi-device scenarios, achieving superior performance in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object recognition on resource-constrained devices like traffic cameras is challenging. While edge computing allows offloading computation-intensive detection to servers, the key challenge is deciding when to use edge detection versus local tracking to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Formulated long-term optimization problems for single/multi-device scenarios, proposed LTED-Ada using deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select between local tracking and edge detection based on frame rate, accuracy, and delay requirements. Enhanced with federated learning for multi-device collaborative training.

Result: Extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using Raspberry Pi 4B devices and PC edge server demonstrated the superiority of LTED-Ada in performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada provides an effective solution for adaptive video object recognition in mobile edge computing environments, balancing accuracy and resource constraints through intelligent switching between local tracking and edge detection.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [4] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free early-exit framework that accelerates Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when intermediate trajectories meet lightweight planning priors, achieving up to 28% sparsity and 29% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, which limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving applications.

Method: Uses action-guided early-exit based on physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories, employs a multi-hop controller to skip redundant layers, and integrates with existing VLA models without retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on Bench2Drive benchmark while maintaining planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating VLA planning models through early-exit strategies based on trajectory feasibility, enabling practical deployment in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [5] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Model Distillation (FMD) compresses large self-supervised learning models into compact proxies that retain general-purpose representational power, with Foundry as the first implementation for 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are computationally expensive and impractical for edge devices, while existing compression methods sacrifice the generality that makes foundation models valuable.

Method: Foundry trains a student model to learn compressed SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of the latent space.

Result: A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks (classification, part segmentation, few-shot scenarios), approaching full foundation-model performance with significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs.

Conclusion: FMD enables practical deployment of foundation models on resource-constrained hardware while preserving their general-purpose representational capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [6] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model that detects manipulated regions in generative inpainting by using patch embeddings and a linear classification head, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 12% higher IoU than competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting that can handle semantic alterations while being robust to post-processing operations.

Method: Uses a DINOv2 model pretrained on B-Free dataset, adds a linear classification head on patch embeddings for 14×14 patch resolution prediction, employs sliding-window strategy for larger images, and post-processes heatmaps into binary masks.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on various inpainting datasets, achieves 12% higher IoU than next best model, remains robust to resizing, noise addition, and JPEG compression.

Conclusion: DINOv2-based Vision Transformers demonstrate strong representational power for manipulation localization, and DinoLizer shows superiority over other methods including DINOv3 in ablation studies.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [7] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS is a new benchmark for evaluating vision language models' ability to perform tool-based UI design tasks through software tools like Figma/Sketch, covering 598 tasks across 30 UI categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing benchmarks evaluate VLMs' capacity to operate design software for iterative UI design, which is important for understanding their potential to collaborate with designers in conventional workflows.

Method: Created CANVAS benchmark with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 categories, featuring two task types: design replication (reproducing whole UI screens) and design modification (modifying specific parts of existing screens).

Result: Leading models show more strategic tool invocations that improve design quality, and common error patterns were identified to guide future improvements.

Conclusion: CANVAS enables evaluation of VLMs' tool-based UI design capabilities, revealing current performance levels and error patterns that will help enhance future tool-based design systems.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [8] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE is a text-guided semantic image encoder that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries, improving VLMs' performance and efficiency across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image encoders in VLMs process images agnostically without considering downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE) that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries, reducing image tokens by half.

Result: TIE-based VLMs outperform conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine benchmarks at 1B and 3B scales, with up to 6-point gains on DocVQA and InfoVQA, while using only half the image tokens.

Conclusion: TIE effectively optimizes encoders to capture key visual features, improves interpretability through query-specific attention, and enhances both performance and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARC is a unified model that can reconstruct full RGB surfaces and classify material categories from just a single 10% contiguous patch of an image, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 17.55 dB PSNR and 85.10% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for material surface understanding require dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environments where only sparse visual cues are available.

Method: Combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head to enable both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity, using only a single 10% contiguous image patch as input.

Result: Outperforms five baseline models (convolutional autoencoders, ViT, MAE, Swin Transformer, DETR) on the Touch and Go dataset, achieving 17.55 dB PSNR for surface reconstruction and 85.10% accuracy for material classification.

Conclusion: Partial convolution provides significant advantages for spatial reasoning under missing data, establishing a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding in robotics, simulation, and material perception applications.

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework that enables multimodal reasoning with long videos through interleaved tool use and chain-of-thought, addressing hallucination issues in large multimodal models by implementing global-to-local video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed, similar to how humans need to skim globally and examine relevant clips for details.

Method: Uses LMMs' temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on specific clips and resample finer-grained frames in a global-to-local reasoning loop until answers are grounded in visual evidence. Includes a three-stage training strategy with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Developed VideoSIAH dataset with 247.9K training samples and 1,280 evaluation QA pairs.

Conclusion: LongVT effectively addresses hallucination in long video reasoning through agentic multimodal chain-of-tool-thought, providing a robust framework for grounded video understanding with publicly available code, data, and models.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight reproduction of KRISP with significantly fewer parameters, achieving 75% of original performance while uncovering design flaws and enabling edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more accessible version of KRISP that addresses computational demands and industrial-scale training requirements, making knowledge-enhanced VQA more practical for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Replicated KRISP with reduced parameters, conducted systematic ablation studies including proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on DAQUAR dataset, constrained by external knowledge graph domain to prevent hallucinations.

Result: Achieved 75% of original KRISP performance while enabling deployment on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, with improved offline visual reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Lightweight knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures can be effective under resource constraints, revealing scalability insights and practical deployment opportunities while maintaining domain-constrained outputs to prevent AI hallucinations.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

### [12] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework called 'warping' that generalizes dynamic sampling methods in deep learning, analyzes their statistical properties, reveals forward-backward asymmetry in training, and provides conditions for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the theoretical analysis of various dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures (deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, spatial transformer networks) which have shown utility but lack unified theoretical understanding.

Method: Developed a novel 'warping' operator that generalizes existing dynamic sampling methods, conducted statistical analysis modeling inputs as IID variables and homogeneous random fields, analyzed forward-backward training asymmetry, and introduced gradient-based loss landscape visualization.

Result: Discovered that dynamic sampling mechanisms represent a different class of orthogonal operators compared to traditional translationally invariant convolution operators, identified conditions for stable training, and analyzed discretization effects statistically.

Conclusion: The warping operator provides a unified theoretical framework for analyzing dynamic sampling methods, revealing their unique properties and providing practical guidance for stable training of such architectures.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

### [13] [$Δ$-NeRF: Incremental Refinement of Neural Radiance Fields through Residual Control and Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20804)
*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF is a modular residual framework for incremental refinement of Neural Radiance Fields that enables efficient updates without catastrophic forgetting, reducing training time by 30-42% while maintaining performance comparable to joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most NeRF frameworks require complete retraining for new views, limiting applicability in sequential data scenarios like satellite terrain analysis where regions are observed over time. Incremental refinement remains underexplored and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes Δ-NeRF with: (1) residual controller for per-layer corrections to frozen base NeRF, (2) uncertainty-aware gating to prevent overcorrection, (3) view selection reducing training data by 47%, and (4) knowledge distillation to compress model to 20% of original size.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42%. Outperforms baselines with up to 43.5% PSNR improvement over naive fine-tuning and surpasses joint training on some metrics in satellite imagery experiments.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF provides an effective solution for incremental NeRF refinement that addresses catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient updates without access to past data, making it suitable for sequential data applications like satellite terrain analysis.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Motivation: To address the data scarcity problem in generative video composition and enhance control over dynamic subject-scene interactions without relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: Splits unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them using a transformation-aware training pipeline with multi-layer fusion, augmentation for affordance-aware composition, and identity-preservation loss to maintain foreground fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM successfully learns complex compositional dynamics for realistic video generation through self-supervised learning on unlabeled video data, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

### [16] [Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821)
*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) as a training-free alternative to diffusion priors in text-to-image generation, using iterative optimization with novel constraints to achieve comparable performance without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models rely on computationally expensive prior networks trained on massive datasets. The authors challenge this necessity and seek a training-free, data-free alternative.

Method: OVI initializes latent visual representations from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes them using cosine similarity with text embeddings, with additional Mahalanobis-based and Nearest-Neighbor loss constraints for regularization.

Result: OVI serves as an effective alternative to traditional priors, with Nearest-Neighbor approach achieving quantitative scores comparable to state-of-the-art data-efficient priors. The study also reveals flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OVI demonstrates that trained priors may not be necessary for text-to-image generation, and the approach merits further investigation as a viable training-free alternative.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model that generates vascular tree centerlines using recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories, achieving superior recall with fewer parameters and faster inference than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tubular tree centerlines with correct topology is critical for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgical planning, where missing small branches can lead to fatal mistakes due to incomplete assessments.

Method: Uses Producer-Refiner architecture with Transformer decoder: Producer proposes initial confluent trajectories, Refiner recurrently refines them to form centerline graphs. Includes efficient non-maximum suppression for merging duplicate branches.

Result: Achieves superior recall and comparable precision to SOTA across multiple datasets, with 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters and faster inference speed.

Conclusion: RefTr demonstrates potential as new SOTA framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, offering improved performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images captured across 50 optical configurations (10 focal lengths, 5 apertures) to address the lack of real optical data for depth estimation and related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation research is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity real stereo datasets, restricting real-world generalization of models trained on synthetic data.

Method: Created a dataset with 9 scenes captured using two identical DSLR cameras at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), totaling 50 optical configurations with 2000 images per scene.

Result: Provides the first high-resolution (5472×3648px) stereo DSLR dataset enabling controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for various computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, revealing challenges with current state-of-the-art methods and supporting reproducible research on optical generalization.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

*Sree Bhattacharyya,Yaman Kumar Singla,Sudhir Yarram,Somesh Kumar Singh,Harini S,James Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability using 82,000+ videos with recall descriptions from tip-of-the-tongue queries, enabling better recall generation and retrieval than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual memorability research is limited by expensive human annotations and lack of nuanced recall data. Existing datasets only provide aggregate scores, missing rich memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Method: Leveraged tip-of-the-tongue retrieval queries from platforms like Reddit to create an unsupervised dataset. Used large vision-language models fine-tuned on this data and employed contrastive training for multimodal ToT retrieval.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the dataset outperform GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions. Created the first model capable of multimodal ToT retrieval, demonstrating rich memorability signals for recall generation and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The unsupervised dataset and models provide a novel direction for visual memorability research, enabling progress by capturing nuanced memorability signals from natural recall data at scale.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

### [20] [Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865)
*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for estimating fog parameters from stereo images using simultaneous optimization, handling locally homogeneous fog, and creating a new SDIRF dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches estimate fog parameters sequentially, leading to error propagation. Real-world fog is often globally inhomogeneous, requiring better parameter estimation methods.

Method: Simultaneous estimation of all fog parameters by solving a novel optimization problem, assuming fog is only locally homogeneous. Can be used as add-on module in SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Superior performance on both synthetic and real foggy data (SDIRF dataset), producing most accurate estimates and better adaptation to real fog compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles real-world fog conditions, advances visual perception in fog, and the publicly available SDIRF dataset supports further research in this area.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

### [21] [V$^{2}$-SAM: Marrying SAM2 with Multi-Prompt Experts for Cross-View Object Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20886)
*Jiancheng Pan,Runze Wang,Tianwen Qian,Mohammad Mahdi,Yanwei Fu,Xiangyang Xue,Xiaomeng Huang,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel,Yuqian Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 from single-view to cross-view object correspondence using two complementary prompt generators (geometry-aware V^2-Anchor and appearance-guided V^2-Visual) with multi-expert design and cyclic consistency selection, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence faces challenges from drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models like SAM2 non-trivial to apply directly. The paper aims to establish consistent object associations across different viewpoints (ego-centric and exo-centric).

Method: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 through two prompt generators: Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor) using DINOv3 features for geometry-aware correspondences and coordinate-based prompting, and Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) with visual prompt matcher for appearance alignment. Uses multi-expert design with Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) for adaptive expert selection.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence) benchmarks.

Conclusion: V^2-SAM provides an effective unified framework for cross-view object correspondence by adapting SAM2 with complementary geometry and appearance guidance, demonstrating strong performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA aligns diffusion models by optimizing the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, preventing reward hacking while maintaining cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time alignment methods tend to either under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) the target reward function, exploiting non-semantic noise patterns.

Method: Optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than manipulating latent or noise variables, ensuring alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes semantic-space optimization as an effective and principled novel paradigm for test-time alignment.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaINeR is a geometry-aware implicit neural representation that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks for 2D images, enabling continuous representation, interpretable structure, and local editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional INRs lack explicit geometric structure and have limited local editing capabilities, restricting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: Combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks - for each image coordinate, retrieves K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts RGB values via neural network.

Result: Enables continuous image representation with interpretable geometric structure and flexible local editing capabilities.

Conclusion: GaINeR provides a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation by integrating geometric structure with implicit neural representations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

TL;DR: Deep learning model successfully restores standard-dose contrast-enhanced MRI quality from low-dose (10-30%) images, enabling accurate vestibular schwannoma detection and segmentation with significantly reduced contrast agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce contrast agent dose in cerebellopontine angle MRI while maintaining diagnostic quality for vestibular schwannoma evaluation.

Method: Multi-center retrospective study using T1 and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to simulate low-dose images, training DL models to restore standard-dose quality from reduced-dose inputs.

Result: DL restoration improved image quality metrics (SSIM: 0.639 to 0.993, PSNR: 21.6 to 41.4 dB) and segmentation performance (Dice: 0.673 to 0.734) at 10% dose. 10-30% dose images were rated excellent by radiologists.

Conclusion: DL model enables lesion detection and characterization with only 10-30% of standard contrast dose, significantly reducing agent exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Conclusion: The proposed smooth regularization technique effectively improves video recognition performance in lightweight models by enforcing temporal coherence through Gaussian Random Walk modeling.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an open-vocabulary framework for compositional explanations of neuron activations in vision models, eliminating the need for human-annotated datasets by using semantic segmentation masks from open vocabulary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, limiting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. The goal is to create a more flexible framework that can probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets.

Method: The framework has three steps: (1) specify arbitrary concepts, (2) generate semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and (3) derive compositional explanations from these masks. It leverages masks from open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute explanations.

Result: The framework is compared with previous methods using quantitative metrics and human interpretability. It analyzes differences when shifting from human-annotated to model-annotated data and demonstrates enhanced flexibility for various tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: The proposed open-vocabulary framework successfully addresses the limitations of previous compositional explanation methods by enabling flexible probing of neurons for arbitrary concepts without relying on human-annotated datasets, providing more adaptable and comprehensive explanations.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

*Henry Marichal,Joaquin Blanco,Diego Passarella,Gregory Randall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UruDendro4, a dataset of 102 annotated Pinus taeda L. wood cross-section images with multi-height samples for volumetric growth modeling, and provides baseline performance for automatic ring detection using DeepCS-TRD method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tree-ring measurement is time-consuming and imprecise, and there's scarcity of wood cross-section data for automated analysis and volumetric growth modeling.

Method: Created UruDendro4 dataset with 102 manually annotated samples from multiple stem heights, and evaluated state-of-the-art ring detection methods including DeepCS-TRD with ablation experiments.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved best performance with mAP of 0.838, mAR of 0.782, and Adapted Rand Error of 0.084. Training with this dataset improved model generalization for tree-ring detection.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 enables volumetric wood growth modeling and provides a valuable resource for automated tree-ring analysis, with demonstrated improvements in detection accuracy and model generalization.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

*Rawa Mohammed,Mina Attin,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework that generates breast ultrasound reports without paired image-report supervision by using structured descriptors and radiomics features, achieving improved performance on both standard metrics and clinical efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound faces limitations due to lack of paired image-report datasets and hallucination risks from large language models.

Method: Constructs reports from structured descriptors and radiomics features, uses multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss, and aligns visual-textual tokens via dual-level objective combining token-level cross-entropy with cosine-similarity alignment loss.

Result: Consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two public BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA), particularly for key targets like BI-RADS category and pathology.

Conclusion: Descriptor-aware vision model trained with combined token-level and alignment loss improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [29] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces expressive composition task focusing on artistic/stylistic image editing rather than realism, and presents StickerNet framework that learns from real user editing patterns to predict sticker placement parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image composition focuses on realism, but modern content creation often aims for artistic, playful, or socially engaging compositions that don't preserve realism. Users on online platforms seek community recognition through expressive editing.

Method: Two-stage StickerNet framework: first determines composition type, then predicts placement parameters (opacity, mask, location, scale). Dataset built from 1.8M real editing actions from online platform, ensuring authentic user behavior.

Result: StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior in user studies and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite task ambiguity.

Conclusion: This work shifts visual understanding from realism to expressiveness and user intent, introducing a new direction that better reflects how people actually edit images on creative platforms.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersection analysis that reduces video-to-text conversion time by 4x using sequential VLM processing with overlapping camera coverage and object-level similarity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing multi-camera traffic feeds are inefficient due to time-consuming video-to-text conversion using Vision-Language Models, which delays timely insights and incident investigation.

Method: Uses sequential approach with overlapping camera coverage areas, iteratively applying VLMs with varying token limits and using previous outputs as prompts. Includes object-level similarity detector to bypass redundant VLM invocations.

Result: Experimental results show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4x while maintaining information accuracy.

Conclusion: TrafficLens provides an efficient solution for real-time traffic video analysis by optimizing VLM usage and leveraging camera overlap, enabling faster insights from multi-camera traffic systems.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification, achieving strong privacy protection while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative machine learning in healthcare faces privacy challenges due to regulations like HIPAA. While federated learning enables decentralized training, conventional FL gradients remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose sensitive medical data.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE), using the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation. Encrypts CLS tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens achieves 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption. Prevents model inversion attacks (gradients were highly vulnerable: PSNR 52.26 dB, SSIM 0.999, NMI 0.741). Achieves 96.12% global classification accuracy unencrypted and 90.02% encrypted, with only 326 KB encrypted data transmission per round.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides strong privacy guarantees against reconstruction attacks while maintaining practical communication efficiency and high classification accuracy for secure multi-institutional medical AI collaboration.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows that eliminates computationally expensive inversion processes, enabling style transfer with only forward passes through dynamic midpoint interpolation and attention injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods that rely on computationally intensive inversion processes, which compromise efficiency and cause visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate.

Method: Uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. Includes attention injection for style integration guidance.

Result: Achieves robust fusion avoiding naive overlay shortcomings, demonstrates generalization across diverse styles and content, and provides an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer with enhanced visual fidelity and content preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free framework based on dual rectified flows offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing methods while maintaining high-quality style transfer results across various content and style combinations.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Ref-COD framework that distills references into class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes reference vectors at inference, eliminating the need for test-time reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems require reference images at test time, which limits deployability, adds latency, and increases data-collection burden.

Method: Maintain EMA-updated prototypes per category and predict mixture weights from queries to produce guidance vectors. Use bidirectional attention alignment to bridge representation gaps between reference statistics and camouflaged query features.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on the R2C7K benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient Ref-COD approach that eliminates mandatory test-time references while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Conclusion: WavePCNet effectively addresses the challenges of localizing obscured objects from faint light patterns by integrating physics-driven wavefront propagation modeling with advanced compensation mechanisms, achieving superior performance in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: GuardTrace-VL is a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors multimodal reasoning models' full Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline to detect unsafe content in intermediate reasoning traces, achieving 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal safety guards only evaluate input questions and final answers, neglecting unsafe content that can emerge in intermediate reasoning traces, creating deployment risks even when final answers appear harmless.

Method: Proposed GuardTrace-VL with joint image-text analysis, constructed GuardTrace dataset via diverse prompting and MLRM-human voting pipeline, and implemented three-stage progressive training with data refinement for context-dependent safety preferences.

Result: Achieved 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection, representing 13.5% improvement over previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain test scenarios.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively addresses the critical gap in multimodal safety by monitoring full reasoning pipelines, significantly improving detection of unsafe content that emerges during intermediate reasoning stages.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses layer decomposition challenges by leveraging connections with in/outpainting tasks and demonstrates strong performance in practical editing applications.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity.

Motivation: To overcome three main challenges in news image captioning: incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding in existing methods.

Method: Introduces MERGE framework with entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB), multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for cross-modal alignment, and dynamic retrieval guided by image content for visual-entity matching.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates strong robustness and domain adaptability, effectively addressing key challenges in news image captioning through its multimodal entity-aware retrieval-augmented approach.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the most appropriate Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) metric for a given target dataset by learning the relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms using textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTE metric selection is ad hoc or based on average historical performance, but no single metric works optimally across all target datasets. The effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent.

Method: Formulates metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Uses pretrained language models to encode textual descriptions of datasets and metrics into a shared semantic space. Trains a meta-predictor offline on diverse meta-tasks with listwise optimization to prioritize top-performing metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate strong effectiveness of the MetaRank approach.

Conclusion: MetaRank enables practitioners to automatically select the most appropriate MTE metric for new target datasets based on textual descriptions, addressing the task-dependent nature of metric effectiveness.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: A novel trustworthy multi-view classification framework that uses prototypes to represent neighbor structures, enabling efficient cross-view consensus discovery with competitive performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods have high computational costs due to dense neighbor relationships, cannot ensure inter-view consistency, and lack guarantees for learned neighbor structures in class space, undermining trustworthiness.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures of each view, simplifies intra-view neighbor relation learning, and enables dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures for cross-view consensus discovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing TMVC approaches by providing more efficient and consistent cross-view consensus discovery while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching that explicitly decouples camera directives and integrates parameter embeddings to achieve precise camera control while maintaining semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle with physically consistent image retouching using precise camera parameters. Current methods either rely on ambiguous text prompts that hinder precise control or use separate training approaches that compromise scalability and multi-parameter composition.

Method: CameraMaster decouples camera directives and integrates two streams: directive representation (photographer's intent) and parameter embedding (camera settings). It modulates camera parameters into both directive and content semantics, uses cross-attention for injection, and employs unified layer-wise modulation throughout denoising with conditioning and gating signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on a 78K image-prompt dataset show CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: CameraMaster successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a unified framework that enables precise camera parameter control while maintaining semantic consistency and supporting multi-parameter composition in image retouching.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices miss whether captions can effectively substitute for images in real downstream tasks like retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines.

Method: Builds an extensible benchmark covering 4 domains with fine-grained taxonomies, creating 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions that require visual information. Uses LLMs to answer questions using captions alone to measure caption utility.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation methods have limited generation efficiency, which constrains the expressiveness of 3D characters in real-world applications due to insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints for high-quality motion generation with few sampling steps, uses BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, and generates dance in an efficient non-autoregressive manner. Also supports motion editing for interactive refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency on AIST++ and FineDance datasets, with significant improvements in inference speed and memory utilization.

Conclusion: FlowerDance successfully addresses the efficiency limitations of existing methods while maintaining high motion quality, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring both expressive dance generation and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with accurate nodule morphology description and medical expertise integration, limiting their clinical reliability. Multi-agent systems offer potential for balancing generality and precision in medical applications.

Method: Three-module system: 1) Nodule Spotter coordinates detection models to identify nodules, 2) Radiologist uses localized image description for CT reports, 3) Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning using images, reports, pathology knowledge base, and multi-agent framework.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent shows the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in nodule diagnosis, serving as a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines generative models with physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, using dense degradation modeling and ControlNet to achieve both physical accuracy and perceptual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either produce over-smoothed results with physical constraints or hallucinate details with weak constraints. There's a need to bridge the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual quality in image deblurring.

Method: Models degradation as dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, then uses this descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture that strongly guides the diffusion sampling process.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods and generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios, effectively bridging physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconciles model-based and generative approaches by taming generative priors with explicit physical constraints, achieving superior performance in spatially varying image deblurring.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a unified framework for emotional image generation and editing that uses test-time scaling with an off-the-shelf emotion classifier, optimizing emotional tokens through gradient-based methods and multi-emotion loss to improve emotional accuracy and semantic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Image Emotional Synthesis approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling.

Method: MUSE adopts Test-Time Scaling strategy, leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens, identifies optimal timing using semantic similarity, and uses multi-emotion loss to reduce interference from inherent and similar emotions.

Result: MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing tasks without requiring additional diffusion model updates or specialized emotional synthesis datasets.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Motivation: Long-term AD predictions face challenges maintaining disease-related characteristics with irregular time intervals in sequential data, and time-related distribution aspects can reflect disease characteristic changes.

Method: Uses T-NIG model that estimates temporal parameter within Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution, identifies features using coordinate neighborhoods, incorporates time parameter to understand feature changes in irregular time intervals, and utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks, proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics even with irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: T-NIG model effectively handles irregular time intervals in AD prediction through temporal parameter estimation in Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution and uncertainty reduction, achieving superior performance in maintaining disease characteristics during long-term image generation.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models struggle with accurately interpreting complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantic drift and failed edits.

Method: Proposes MIRA, a plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that uses iterative perception-reasoning-action loops to predict atomic edit instructions step by step with visual feedback. Trained on 150K multimodal dataset (MIRA-Editing) using SFT + GRPO pipeline.

Result: When paired with open-source editing models (Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, Qwen-Image-Edit), MIRA significantly improves semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively addresses the limitations of current instruction-guided image editing by simulating human-model interaction processes through iterative reasoning, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex editing instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: A novel iris authentication pipeline that uses 3D-CNNs with curriculum learning to capture spatio-temporal iris patterns, improving robustness to rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods lack robustness to variations like rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur, and fail to effectively leverage the spatio-temporal structure of iris patterns through simple point-to-point comparisons.

Method: Splits iris images into sequences of sub-images fed to a 3D-CNN, trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in curriculum manner to capture spatio-temporal feature dynamics and embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space.

Result: The approach learns rich spatio-temporal representations that improve discriminability in the deep metric domain, yielding a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum-based 3D-CNN framework effectively captures spatio-temporal iris patterns, enhancing authentication robustness against common challenges like rotation, scale variations, reflections, and blur.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

TL;DR: Pygmalion Effect in Vision framework transforms reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation to improve 3D reconstruction by suppressing specular cues while maintaining geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections, which complicates accurate surface reconstruction.

Method: Dual-branch network with BRDF-based reflective branch and clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals, trained jointly using synthesized clay-like images as reflection-free supervision.

Result: Substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Seeing by unshining (translating radiance into neutrality) serves as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images with complex reflections.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Motivation: Radar sensors provide reliable perception in adverse conditions, but existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific, preventing transfer learning. Foundation models have transformed vision and language but remain underexplored for radar sensing.

Method: Uses structured caption framework encoding vehicle distributions in radar coordinates, hash-aware contrastive learning for continuous scene similarity, and generates large-scale annotated radar datasets using CARLA simulator.

Result: Proposes localization-aware metrics for spatial accuracy assessment beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: RadarFM enables unified scene-level representations and fine-grained spatial reasoning for radar perception, addressing the fragmentation in existing radar approaches.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

TL;DR: EM-KD is a knowledge distillation method for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models that addresses unbalanced vision tokens between teacher and student models through spatial alignment and introduces two distillation strategies for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption but lose visual information, degrading comprehension. Prior knowledge distillation methods overlook fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between student and teacher models.

Method: 1) Calculate Manhattan distance between teacher and student vision logits and align them spatially using Hungarian matching algorithm; 2) Introduce two distillation strategies: Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) that minimizes smooth L1 distance between affinity matrices of text and aligned vision tokens, and Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) that uses reverse KL divergence to measure probability distributions of aligned vision logits over vocabulary space.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows EM-KD trained models outperform prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin. Compared with previous distillation methods equipped with the same vision token matching strategy, EM-KD achieves better performance.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively enhances Efficient MLLMs through knowledge distillation by addressing the vision token imbalance problem and introducing novel distillation strategies, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DATGN, a deformation-aware temporal generative network that automates learning of brain morphological changes from MRI sequences for early Alzheimer's disease prediction, handling missing data and generating future brain images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease can slow its progression, and current methods rely on manual feature extraction from brain images. There's a need for automated methods that can learn morphological changes and handle incomplete temporal MRI data.

Method: DATGN first interpolates incomplete MRI sequences, then uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images that follow disease progression patterns, enabling early AD prediction.

Result: DATGN achieved competitive PSNR and MMSE metrics for MRI generation. When synthetic data was used with classification methods, accuracy improved significantly: 6.21-16% for AD vs. NC and 7.34-21.25% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification.

Conclusion: DATGN successfully generates MRI images consistent with Alzheimer's brain atrophy trends, enabling early disease prediction and improving classification accuracy when integrated with existing methods.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

TL;DR: FaithFusion is a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework that uses Expected Information Gain (EIG) to maintain geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on driving-scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts in driving-scene reconstruction, often leading to over-restoration and geometric drift due to lack of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria.

Method: Introduces FaithFusion framework that uses Expected Information Gain (EIG) as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis. EIG guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions and its pixel-level weighting distills edits back into 3DGS, creating a plug-and-play system without extra prior conditions or structural modifications.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo dataset across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID metrics, maintaining FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion effectively addresses the fusion challenges between geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models, providing a robust solution for controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation with maintained geometric fidelity and visual plausibility.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models that reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining generation quality, achieving up to 2.22× inference speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models have significant parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, requiring efficient pruning methods that preserve output diversity and condition-fidelity.

Method: Uses entropy-guided pruning with Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) metric to assess block importance, and a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework that automatically determines when and how much to prune during training.

Result: Achieves up to 2.22× inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets with DiT and SiT models.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively reduces parameter redundancy in generative models through entropy-guided progressive pruning, enabling faster inference without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Method: The method includes: 1) Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess importance of model components for prioritized training, and 2) an adaptive progressive schedule that increases computational complexity based on convergence efficiency measurements.

Result: Extensive experiments across three datasets show Ent-Prog achieves up to 2.2× training speedup and 2.4× GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog effectively addresses the computational and memory challenges in training diffusion models for human video generation while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion model that handles both video understanding and controllable generation using multiple graphics-based modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, albedo, roughness, metallic) with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy, enabling precise video edits like relighting and material swaps while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-only cues are insufficient for physically meaningful video edits as they under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, causing temporal drift. Additional graphics-based modalities provide complementary constraints for better understanding and precise control.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from multiple modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, albedo, roughness, metallic), trained on MMVideo dataset - a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions.

Result: CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity across understanding and generation benchmarks, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust to missing modalities.

Conclusion: Enriching video diffusion models with graphics-based modalities enables precise, predictable control for physically meaningful edits while maintaining temporal coherence, overcoming limitations of geometry-only approaches.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

*Xintian Mao,Haofei Song,Yin-Nian Liu,Qingli Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) that learns blur kernels in Fourier space, enabling kernel-level deblurring with low complexity and no extra supervision, achieving state-of-the-art motion deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks only perform pixel-level restoration and fail to understand the essence of blur at the kernel level, where blur is fundamentally caused by convolution with blur kernels.

Method: Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) converts convolution to multiplication in Fourier space, learns blur kernels from network features instead of images, and uses a decoupled multi-scale architecture with reversible sub-unets for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results, learns physically meaningful kernels, and shows potential for other kernel-related problems.

Conclusion: The proposed FKE enables effective kernel-level blur process learning, significantly improving deblurring performance while maintaining low complexity and requiring no additional supervision.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs enhances capability but incurs significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient encoding methods.

Method: Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) with two modules: refined patch embedding for flexible patch-size scaling, and windowed token compression hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations.

Result: ViT-UHD achieves competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT by 2.4x; LLaVA-UHD v3 achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Conclusion: PVC enables efficient native-resolution encoding in MLLMs while preserving generality, offering a practical solution to computational overhead issues in visual encoding.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

### [59] [Progress by Pieces: Test-Time Scaling for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21185)
*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models that uses grid-partitioned progressive generation with early pruning and layout-specified prompt reformulation to achieve higher quality image generation with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time computation scaling has been successful in natural language tasks but remains unexplored for visual AR models. Naive approaches like Best-of-N are suboptimal because they waste computation on erroneous trajectories and lack a blueprint of the entire canvas.

Method: GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme where multiple partial candidates are generated for each position, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones become anchors to guide subsequent decoding. It also uses layout-specified prompt reformulation to infer feasible layouts from partial views.

Result: With N=4, GridAR outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also shows comparable edit quality and 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively addresses the challenges of test-time scaling for visual AR models through progressive generation with early pruning and layout-aware prompt reformulation, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

*Baoli Sun,Xinzhu Ma,Ning Wang,Zhihui Wang,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxyFormer is a novel RVOS architecture that introduces proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics, enabling better cross-modality alignment and inter-frame dependency modeling for accurate video object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods have limitations: (1) conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency modeling, making tracking difficult amid frame variations; (2) textual constraints are integrated belatedly, causing video features to potentially focus on non-referred objects.

Method: Proposes ProxyFormer with proxy queries that integrate visual and text semantics, progressively updated across video feature encoder stages. Uses decoupled cross-modality interactions in temporal and spatial dimensions, and Joint Semantic Consistency training to align proxy queries with video-text pairs.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four RVOS benchmarks demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProxyFormer effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches by enabling dynamic semantic flow between modalities and establishing inter-frame dependencies, leading to improved object tracking accuracy and coherence.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UPA-RFAS is a universal adversarial patch attack framework that transfers across different Vision-Language-Action models, architectures, and sim-to-real scenarios by combining feature-space objectives, robustness augmentation, and VLA-specific attention/semantic attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing patches overfit to specific models and fail in black-box settings. There's a need for universal, transferable attacks that work across unknown architectures and real-world deployments.

Method: UPA-RFAS combines: (1) feature-space objective with L1 deviation and repulsive InfoNCE loss for transferable representation shifts, (2) two-phase min-max procedure with inner loop for sample-wise perturbations and outer loop for universal patch optimization, (3) VLA-specific losses including Patch Attention Dominance and Patch Semantic Misalignment.

Result: Experiments show UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, manipulation tasks, and physical executions, working across different viewpoints and exposing a practical patch-based attack surface.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a strong baseline for universal adversarial attacks on VLA systems and highlights the need for future defenses against such transferable patch-based threats.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEAR is an automated red-teaming framework that uncovers safety risks in text-to-video models by exploiting temporal dynamics through temporal-aware test generation and preference learning, achieving over 80% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static image and text generation are insufficient for capturing the complex temporal dynamics in video generation, creating critical safety challenges in T2V models.

Method: TEAR uses a temporal-aware test generator with two-stage optimization (initial training and temporal-aware online preference learning) and a refine model to cyclically improve prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments show TEAR achieves over 80% attack success rate across open-source and commercial T2V systems, significantly outperforming prior best result of 57%.

Conclusion: TEAR effectively addresses the unique safety challenges in T2V models by focusing on temporal dynamics, demonstrating the need for specialized safety evaluation frameworks for video generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BotaCLIP is a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) to inject botanical domain knowledge by aligning aerial imagery with ecological data, achieving better performance in biodiversity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt pre-trained foundation models to inject domain-specific knowledge without expensive retraining, specifically for ecological applications where expert knowledge is valuable but data is scarce.

Method: BotaCLIP uses contrastive learning with regularization to align high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés, preventing catastrophic forgetting while adapting the DOFA foundation model.

Result: BotaCLIP embeddings consistently outperformed DOFA and supervised baselines in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling efficient representation learning for specialized applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

TL;DR: ConFu is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds individual modalities and their fused combinations, capturing higher-order dependencies while preserving pairwise relationships through an extended contrastive objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods either focus on pairwise alignment or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships when capturing higher-order interactions, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks.

Method: Extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term that aligns modality pairs with a third modality, enabling joint embedding of individual modalities and their fused combinations.

Result: Competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, ability to capture XOR-like higher-order dependencies, and support for unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single framework.

Conclusion: ConFu successfully captures higher-order multimodal dependencies while maintaining strong pairwise correspondence, demonstrating scalability with increasing multimodal complexity.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

TL;DR: AnchorOPT is a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework that introduces learnable anchor tokens and adaptive positional relationships between anchors and soft tokens, improving CLIP model generalization without requiring additional modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual tokens as anchors that lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility, limiting their effectiveness across different tasks and training stages.

Method: AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two dimensions: (1) anchor values learn dynamically from task-specific data instead of using handcrafted textual tokens, and (2) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix. Training occurs in two stages: first learning anchor tokens, then freezing them to optimize soft tokens and position matrix.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AnchorOPT achieves performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional learnable modules or regularization techniques, and integrates seamlessly as a plug-and-play module with consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT provides an effective dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework that enhances CLIP model generalization through learnable anchors and adaptive positional relationships, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Motivation: To enable real-time, low-power detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure while preserving spatial feature grounding and interpretability, unlike conventional CNN approaches.

Method: Integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with latency-driven spike conversion and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network for classification, tested on Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset with 6,000 labeled frames.

Result: Achieved 92.3% classification accuracy (±0.8%) with 9.5ms per-frame inference time and 8.1% sparse spike activity, enabling real-time edge deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: The SIFT-SNN framework provides an efficient, interpretable solution for structural safety monitoring with validated prototype deployment, though generalization to unseen field conditions requires further validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a compact, unified architecture for fine-grained, general-purpose 3D vision-language understanding that naturally supports human interactions across diverse 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monet is a training framework that enables MLLMs to reason directly in latent visual space using continuous embeddings as visual thoughts, addressing computational cost and supervision challenges through a three-stage SFT pipeline and introducing VLPO for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning methods lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to limitations of external tools, and there are challenges with high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings.

Method: Three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning pipeline, VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning method, and construction of Monet-SFT-125K dataset with 125K text-image interleaved CoTs.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables direct latent visual reasoning, with empirical analysis providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

*Hanyang Li,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCBoost is a parameter-free plug-in that enhances deep clustering models by leveraging reliable local structural cues to improve global feature structures, achieving significant performance improvements across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods suffer from a disparity between well-structured local features and poorly separated global feature clusters, with intertwined boundaries between classes.

Method: The method first identifies high-confidence samples using adaptive k-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, then uses these reliable samples to compute a discriminative loss that promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separability for network optimization.

Result: DCBoost significantly improves clustering performance of diverse deep clustering models, boosting state-of-the-art baselines like ProPos by over 3% and amplifying silhouette coefficient by more than 7x across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DCBoost effectively bridges the gap between local and global feature structures in deep clustering, demonstrating substantial performance improvements as a parameter-free plug-in that can enhance existing models.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

### [71] [Do Reasoning Vision-Language Models Inversely Scale in Test-Time Compute? A Distractor-centric Empirical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21397)
*Jiyun Bae,Hyunjong Ok,Sangwoo Mo,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual distractors in VLMs cause inverse scaling (reduced accuracy without longer reasoning), unlike textual distractors that increase reasoning length. The study introduces Idis dataset and shows attribute tracking reveals distractor impact, with applications to bias benchmarks and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if visual distractors cause inverse scaling effects similar to those observed in language models, where distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning.

Method: Created Idis dataset with systematic visual distractors (semantic, numerical, spatial), analyzed reasoning traces, tracked attribute counts, and tested on visual bias benchmarks like Waterbirds.

Result: Visual distractors cause inverse scaling (accuracy decreases without reasoning length increase), attribute tracking reveals distractor impact, and simple prompting can mitigate bias-driven predictions.

Conclusion: Visual distractors fundamentally differ from textual ones in their scaling effects, and attribute-level analysis provides key insights for understanding and mitigating distractor impacts in VLMs.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel remote sensing change captioning method that uses the SAM foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment in remote sensing change captioning, which aims to describe changes between two images in natural language.

Method: Uses CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM foundation model for semantic/motion change regions, knowledge graph for object information, cross-attention fusion, and Transformer decoder for caption generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses region awareness and temporal alignment issues in remote sensing change captioning by leveraging SAM foundation model and knowledge graph integration.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

*Baoli Sun,Yihan Wang,Xinzhu Ma,Zhihui Wang,Kun Lu,Zhiyong Wang*

TL;DR: The paper proposes ART framework for fine-grained action recognition using query-response mechanism to track distinctive local details through action tracklets with text-constrained semantics from VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle with subtle local details that evolve over time, which are crucial for distinguishing similar fine-grained actions.

Method: ART framework with region-specific semantic activation module using text-constrained queries from VLMs to capture action-related regions, organized into tracklets with multi-level contrastive constraints and task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on action recognition benchmarks demonstrate superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed ART framework effectively tracks distinctive local details through action tracklets, enabling better discrimination of similar fine-grained actions compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative study of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow generative models showing CFM outperforms DDPM (FID 24.15 vs 402.98) and MeanFlow enables 50X faster single-step generation (FID 29.15). CFM extended to image inpainting with significant quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different generative modeling paradigms and address the computational inefficiency of iterative sampling methods by exploring faster alternatives like MeanFlow.

Method: Implemented DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow using unified TinyUNet architecture on CIFAR-10. Extended CFM to image inpainting with four mask types and mask-guided sampling.

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 (vs DDPM's 402.98), MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling (50X faster). Inpainting improved PSNR from 4.95 to 8.57 dB (+73%) and SSIM from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%).

Conclusion: CFM is superior to DDPM, MeanFlow enables efficient single-step generation, and inpainting-aware training significantly improves image reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce spatially sparse but temporally dense data, and existing representation learning methods struggle with undersampling caused by this spatial sparsity.

Method: Proposes a hypergraph-based completion mechanism that connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations, uses contextual information message passing to complete sparse events, and can incorporate RGB tokens for multi-modal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-guided approach successfully addresses the spatial sparsity problem in event stream data and enables effective multi-modal feature learning and fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

*Shuhan Xia,Xuannan Liu,Xing Cui,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3-Tracer is a novel framework for detecting partial audio forgeries by jointly analyzing audio at frame, segment, and audio levels using two complementary modules: FA-FAM for frame-level authenticity detection and SMDAM for segment-level forgery boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio forgeries are difficult to detect because attackers selectively modify only critical frames while preserving overall perceptual authenticity, and existing methods lack hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels.

Method: T3-Tracer uses two core modules: (1) Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) that combines frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global inconsistencies, and (2) Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM) with dual-branch architecture that models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale windows to identify abrupt anomalies at forged boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that T3-Tracer achieves state-of-the-art performance in partial audio forgery detection.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by jointly analyzing audio at multiple temporal levels, providing comprehensive detection of forgery traces in partial audio manipulations.

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Address the quadratic computational complexity of Vision Transformers and limitations of existing token reduction methods that overlook frequency characteristics like rank collapsing and over-smoothing.

Method: Partition tokens into high-frequency and low-frequency categories, selectively preserve high-frequency tokens, and aggregate low-frequency tokens into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead, effectively mitigates rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon.

Conclusion: The frequency-aware token reduction approach provides an effective solution to Vision Transformer's computational challenges while maintaining performance, with analysis revealing implicit frequency characteristics and limitations in previous methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods miss subtle emotional details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth, failing to capture authentic facial expressions in human communication.

Method: Extends self-supervised 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression parameter supervision from spontaneous 4D facial scans and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss to prevent exaggeration.

Result: Produces emotion-rich 3D face models with highly realistic expressions from single images, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: The dual-supervision strategy effectively bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a novel Class Incremental Learning approach that manipulates model weights through inter-task and intra-task merging with bounded updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by directly optimizing model weights in parameter space without modifying architectures or learning objectives.

Method: Uses two weight merging techniques: inter-task merging (averaging weights from previous stages) and intra-task merging (combining parameters within current stage), plus bounded update optimization to minimize cumulative changes while preserving previous knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on standard CIL benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: M&B effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting through parameter-space optimization and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. While data augmentation helps empirically, a systematic theoretical approach is needed to guarantee these properties by construction.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks with a novel projection layer from ℂ to ℝ before Gumbel Softmax, maintaining theoretical guarantees for shift equivariance and invariance.

Result: Evaluated on computer vision problems using polarimetric SAR images, achieving improved performance for invariance in classification and equivariance in reconstruction and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The extension of LPS to complex-valued networks with the proposed projection layer successfully achieves shift equivariance and invariance properties in various computer vision applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark for audio-video forgery detection, highlighting both the promise and limitations of current AV-LMMs in detecting diverse forgery types across complex natural scenes.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Motivation: Address limitations of existing 3D point cloud defense methods that suffer from high computational overhead and poor generalization across diverse attack types.

Method: Uses multimodal teacher-student framework with three teachers (vision model for depth projections, high-performance 3D model, text encoder) and confidence-gated mechanism to balance modality contributions during training.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against white-box and black-box attacks, while achieving better performance on clean data with no inference cost.

Conclusion: Presents a practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge through training-time distillation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes, enabling interactive generation from single-frame input with bounding box conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods only support single frame generation, while prediction approaches require multiple historical frames and lack interactivity, failing to support long-horizon interactive generation.

Method: LaGen uses a single-frame LiDAR input with bounding box conditions, features a scene decoupling estimation module for object-level interactive generation, and a noise modulation module to reduce error accumulation in long sequences.

Result: LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on later frames, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on nuScenes-based evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: LaGen successfully enables long-horizon, interactive LiDAR scene generation with high fidelity, addressing limitations of existing approaches through autoregressive frame-by-frame generation.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS is a framework that corrects 3D Gaussian Splatting's geometric inaccuracies to generate precise correspondence labels for training robust, zero-shot image matchers, achieving up to 17.7% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based image matching requires large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. While 3DGS enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering prevent robust correspondence labeling.

Method: Twofold approach: (1) geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce precise correspondence labels, and (2) 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into 2D matchers.

Result: Generated ground-truth correspondences reduce epipolar error by up to 40x compared to existing datasets. State-of-the-art matchers trained on this data achieve up to 17.7% zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source for training robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Motivation: To create the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series that can handle diverse multimodal tasks including image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Method: Three key architectural upgrades: enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for spatial-temporal modeling, DeepStack integration for multi-level ViT features, and text-based time alignment for video (evolving from T-RoPE to explicit timestamp alignment).

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL serves as a foundational engine for multimodal applications, delivering superior performance under comparable token budgets and latency constraints in both dense and MoE architectures.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that excels across multiple remote sensing tasks through multi-task learning, leveraging vision-language models' text-based interface potential and addressing the complex RS data environment.

Method: Proposes RSCoVLM with data curation engine, unified dynamic-resolution strategy, Zoom-in Chain mechanism for UHR images, enhanced object detection capability, and novel evaluation protocol.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and rivaling specialized expert models.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective baseline that promotes progress toward general-purpose RS models, with all tools, models, and datasets open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Conclusion: The system provides a practical and efficient approach for AI error correction on resource-constrained devices, demonstrating real-world applicability with significant performance improvements and minimal resource requirements.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Transformers for road segmentation have quadratic complexity that limits deployment on resource-constrained platforms, while road networks require modeling of long, continuous structures where Mamba's linear-time efficiency could be beneficial.

Method: Hybrid architecture integrating Mamba blocks for tracing continuous road networks and preserving topological structure, combined with Transformer blocks for global context refinement.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets, with significant improvements in topological continuity (APLS metric) while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: PathMamba demonstrates that combining Mamba's sequential modeling with Transformer's global reasoning yields topologically superior road segmentation without the scaling costs of pure attention-based models, setting a new benchmark for the task.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: ADVLA is a feature-space adversarial attack framework for Vision-Language-Action models that applies perturbations directly to visual features projected into textual space, achieving high attack success with minimal patch modifications and imperceptible perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for VLA models require costly end-to-end training and generate noticeable perturbation patches, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: ADVLA applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from visual encoder to textual feature space, using attention guidance to make perturbations focused and sparse. It employs three strategies: sensitivity enhancement, sparsity enforcement, and perturbation concentration.

Result: Under L∞=4/255 constraint, ADVLA with Top-K masking modifies <10% of patches while achieving ~100% attack success rate. Perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, nearly imperceptible, and single-step iteration takes only ~0.06 seconds.

Conclusion: ADVLA effectively weakens VLA model action predictions under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, demonstrating unique effectiveness for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency where textures appear convincing from one viewpoint but fail to align across others, caused by attention ambiguity in unstructured full attention.

Method: Introduces CaliTex framework with two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention that routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways. Uses a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: Empirically produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization, effectively addressing cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTTM is a training-free 3D token merging method that accelerates VGGT by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, preserving feature uniqueness and achieving up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's joint inference of 3D attributes requires global attention layers with all-to-all computation, causing latency bottlenecks for large scenes with long-sequence inputs.

Method: Head-wise temporal merging (HTTM) merges tokens in multi-head granularity instead of uniformly across attention heads, leveraging spatial locality and temporal correspondence at head level.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in GPU-based inference, outperforming existing merging techniques.

Conclusion: HTTM effectively addresses the latency bottleneck in VGGT while maintaining representational ability through head-wise token merging.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

TL;DR: A novel normal estimation method for point clouds using multi-scale feature fusion and patch feature fitting to address neighborhood size selection challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes for different point cloud data and geometries, leading to inaccurate normal estimation. Current approaches use parameter-heavy strategies but still face difficulties in accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes Patch Feature Fitting (PFF) using multi-scale feature fusion: 1) Feature aggregation module progressively aggregates patch features from different scales while shrinking patch size, 2) Feature compensation module ensures reusability of large-scale features and reveals cross-scale associations, enabling scale adaptation for varying local patches.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and reduced running time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The multi-scale feature fusion approach effectively addresses the patch size selection problem in normal estimation, providing robust performance across diverse point cloud data while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos suffer from strong view-dependent effects like specularities and occlusions, causing pure photometric supervision to misalign with geometry and trigger early geometric drift that becomes hard to correct.

Method: Three main components: 1) Geometry-guided prior distillation using confidence-gated monocular depth with scale-invariant losses, 2) Time-embedded Gaussian field with rotor-like rotation for temporal coherence, 3) Keyframe-constrained streaming with max-points budget for efficiency and stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Endo-G²T framework successfully anchors geometry early while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance through a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism and multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function, without requiring architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders, despite their strong language understanding capabilities.

Method: Proposes STVG-o1 framework with: 1) bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations as intermediate step, 2) multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on HCSTVG, outperforming best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. Demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: STVG-o1 establishes MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal video grounding, enabling off-the-shelf models to achieve state-of-the-art performance without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

*Mingue Park,Prin Phunyaphibarn,Phillip Y. Lee,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR enhances diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models without retraining by combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel latent refinement to improve diversity while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from critical diversity limitations, producing nearly identical images for simple prompts, which has been overlooked amid the focus on image quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Inject noise into text embeddings to enhance diversity, 2) Use scale-travel latent refinement with multi-scale autoencoder to resume generation at intermediate stages and preserve image quality.

Result: Combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR provides an effective test-time solution to improve diversity in VAR models without requiring retraining or substantial computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

*Adeela Islam,Stefano Fiorini,Manuel Lecha,Theodore Tsesmelis,Stuart James,Pietro Morerio,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that uses both geometric and color features with SE(3) flow matching to achieve more accurate fragment assembly, especially when geometry alone is ambiguous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based 3D reassembly methods rely primarily on geometric features, which struggle with ambiguous cases like small, eroded, or symmetric fragments, and lack explicit physical constraints to prevent overlapping assemblies.

Method: Uses rotation-equivariant encoder for geometric features and transformer for color features, combining them into multimodal representations, then predicts transformations using SE(3) flow matching on point clouds with both positions and colors.

Result: On the RePAIR dataset, E-M3RF reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competing methods across four datasets including synthetic and cultural heritage data.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining geometric and color features with equivariant encoding significantly improves 3D reassembly accuracy, especially in challenging cases where geometry alone is insufficient.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileI2V is a lightweight 270M parameter diffusion model that enables real-time 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices through linear hybrid architecture, time-step distillation, and mobile-specific optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges of diffusion models for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices.

Method: Proposed linear hybrid architecture denoiser, time-step distillation reducing sampling steps from 20+ to 2, and mobile-specific attention optimizations for 2x speed-up.

Result: Achieves fast 720p image-to-video generation with quality comparable to existing models, with generation speed under 100ms per frame under one-step conditions.

Conclusion: MobileI2V enables practical real-time video generation on mobile devices for the first time, with significant speed improvements while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-attention distillation methods align teacher and student features independently, lacking dynamic interaction between them. CanKD aims to enable more thorough pixel-wise relationship capture through cross-attention.

Method: Proposes a cross-attention mechanism where each pixel in student feature map dynamically considers all pixels in teacher feature map. Introduces only an additional loss function for non-local knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation show CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods.

Conclusion: CanKD demonstrates potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision, offering superior performance with minimal additional complexity.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates how implementation details affect deepfake detection performance, identifying key design choices that improve detection accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection effectiveness depends more on implementation details than core design, making fair comparisons difficult and obscuring true performance factors.

Method: Systematic investigation of design choices in training, inference, and incremental updates to isolate individual factor impacts on deepfake detection models.

Result: Identified a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Established robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for designing and developing future deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

*Yiyang Jiang,Guangwu Qian,Jiaxin Wu,Qi Huang,Qing Li,Yongkang Wu,Xiao-Yong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for automated ANA detection using multi-instance multi-label learning with three key components: instance sampler, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA testing for autoimmune disorders is slow, labor-intensive, and requires extensive training. Existing automation methods struggle with the multi-instance, multi-label nature of ANA detection involving over 100 antibody types and complex fluorescent pattern combinations.

Method: Framework inspired by human labeling logic with three components: instance sampler to suppress low-confidence instances, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher for adaptive label assignment, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients for training adjustment based on empirical observations.

Result: Achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains on ANA dataset over prior methods, and top-2 performance on public medical benchmarks with up to 18.2% reduction in Hamming loss and 26.9% reduction in one-error.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles MIML complexities in ANA detection, supports end-to-end optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art results while overcoming limitations of traditional MIML methods.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for Remote Sensing Foundation Models as an efficient alternative to large-scale models, using task-specific specialists that are lightweight, reusable, and support federated training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in Earth Observation require prohibitive computational resources and large datasets, limiting accessibility and contradicting sustainable AI principles due to high carbon footprints.

Method: Decomposes training into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused, supporting federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration.

Result: Creates a modular framework that offers advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility for resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Models through an ensemble approach that is more sustainable and accessible.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for personalized treatment, but existing image generation methods struggle with accurately representing disease characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals.

Method: The study introduces an innovative sequential image generation methodology guided by quantitative metrics, integrating an age-scaling factor to produce age-specific MRI images that maintain essential features indicative of disease progression.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively generates sequential MRI images for Alzheimer's disease prediction, with quantitative metrics and age-scaling factors playing crucial roles in maintaining disease characteristics and improving synthesis accuracy.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

TL;DR: PRFL is a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space for video generation, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models for pixel-space inputs, which incurs substantial memory overhead, increased training time, and lacks early-stage supervision for motion dynamics and structural coherence.

Method: Propose Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL) that leverages pre-trained video generation models for reward modeling in noisy latent space, enabling optimization throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in latent space, and PRFL provides an efficient framework for preference optimization in video generation.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

TL;DR: UAVLight is a new benchmark dataset for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction that captures scenes at multiple fixed times of day along repeatable flight paths, providing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry and viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency from sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows breaks constant-lighting assumptions in multi-view 3D reconstruction methods, causing geometry drift and color inconsistency, especially problematic in UAV-based outdoor reconstruction where lighting changes are unavoidable.

Method: The benchmark captures scenes along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation while maintaining consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Result: UAVLight provides a controlled-yet-real benchmark with standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, enabling isolated study of lighting robustness without confounding geometric and semantic changes.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training improves landmark detection accuracy in pelvic fluoroscopy under variable patient positioning conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume fixed Antero-Posterior views, but real clinical scenarios involve variable patient positioning due to imaging unit repositioning or anatomical movement.

Method: Proposed framework incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, comparing baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss.

Result: The framework shows improved landmark detection accuracy under realistic intra-operative conditions with variable patient pose.

Conclusion: Integrating pose estimation into landmark detection training enhances robustness to patient positioning variations in pelvic fluoroscopy.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

TL;DR: Harmony is a novel framework that addresses audio-visual synchronization challenges in joint diffusion models through cross-task synergy training, global-local decoupled interaction, and synchronization-enhanced CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to three fundamental challenges: correspondence drift in joint diffusion, inefficient global attention mechanisms, and intra-modal bias in conventional CFG.

Method: 1) Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift using audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks; 2) Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient temporal-style alignment; 3) Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly amplifies alignment signals.

Result: Harmony establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses fundamental challenges in joint audio-visual diffusion and achieves superior synchronization through mechanistic enforcement of alignment.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Motivation: Oral cancer is often diagnosed late due to visual similarity between benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions. Early computer-aided diagnosis can improve clinical outcomes.

Method: Combines stratified data splitting with advanced data augmentation and oversampling techniques to handle limited and imbalanced datasets for multiclass classification of 16 oral lesions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates promise as a first step toward trustworthy computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN is a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism in video diffusion models by training an optical-flow discriminator and using distribution-matching regularization, achieving significant motion quality improvements without sacrificing visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models achieve good frame-level fidelity but struggle with motion coherence and realism, producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. The standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency.

Method: Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, MoGAN trains a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity.

Result: On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, it improves motion score by +7.4% over teacher and +8.8% over DMD. Human study shows MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD).

Conclusion: MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

*M. Naseer Subhani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-prompting framework adapts SAM to remote sensing imagery using only sparse point annotations, achieving better performance than pretrained SAM and other point-supervised methods through a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs poorly on remote sensing imagery due to domain shift and lack of dense annotations, creating a need for efficient adaptation methods that don't require full-mask supervision.

Method: Proposes a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop: generating coarse pseudo-masks from points (Refine), improving with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and aligning embeddings to reduce bias (Reinforce).

Result: Outperforms pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised methods on three RSI benchmarks (WHU, HRSID, NWPU VHR-10), demonstrating improved segmentation quality and domain robustness.

Conclusion: Self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path for scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models to remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

TL;DR: A label-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition that uses adversarial exemplar selection and enhanced GCN architectures to reduce dependency on large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition typically require large labeled datasets, which are often scarce in practical applications, creating a need for more label-efficient approaches.

Method: 1) Novel adversarial acquisition function to select informative exemplars for labeling that balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty; 2) Bidirectional and stable GCN architectures for better mapping between ambient and latent spaces.

Result: Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show significant improvements over prior work.

Conclusion: The proposed label-efficient GCN model effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in skeleton-based action recognition through intelligent exemplar selection and enhanced network architectures.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

*Ruisheng Han,Kanglei Zhou,Shuang Chen,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFlow is a unified framework for long-term Action Quality Assessment that combines counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional temporal modeling to address spurious correlations and unstable representations in extended action sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AQA in activities like figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while being robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches suffer from costly annotations, unidirectional temporal modeling, and vulnerability to spurious correlations.

Method: CaFlow integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. It uses Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) to disentangle causal and confounding features self-supervised, and BiT-Flow module to model forward/backward dynamics with cycle-consistency for smoother representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CaFlow provides an effective solution for long-term AQA by addressing both causal robustness and temporal coherence through its unified counterfactual de-confounding and bidirectional flow framework.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: Multi-Crit is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' ability to follow diverse evaluation criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments across open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models are increasingly used as judges in evaluation systems, but their capacity to follow fine-grained, pluralistic evaluation criteria remains underexplored.

Method: Developed Multi-Crit benchmark through rigorous data curation pipeline with challenging response pairs and multi-criterion human annotations, introducing three novel metrics for pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and conflict recognition.

Result: Analysis of 25 LMMs shows proprietary models struggle with consistent pluralistic adherence (especially in open-ended evaluation), open-source models lag further behind in flexible criterion following, and critic fine-tuning enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic judgment.

Conclusion: Multi-Crit establishes foundational framework for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation systems, revealing current limitations in criterion-level judgment capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining U-Net segmentation with DenseNet-VGG classification using multihead attention achieves 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% accuracy for glioma classification from 3D MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas have high mortality rates, requiring early and accurate diagnosis for effective therapeutic intervention. Current methods need improvement in precise tumor demarcation and feature focusing.

Method: Hybrid framework with U-Net segmentation for precise tumor demarcation and DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention mechanisms. Preprocessing includes normalization, resampling, and data augmentation for 3D MRI data.

Result: Achieved 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Enhanced interpretability through attention mechanisms focusing on clinically relevant features.

Conclusion: The framework shows great potential for timely and reliable glioma diagnosis and grading, enabling better patient treatment planning through improved segmentation and classification performance.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

*Zihui Xue,Kristen Grauman,Dima Damen,Andrew Zisserman,Tengda Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CamFormer uses camera trajectory data to understand video content through contrastive learning, showing that camera movement patterns can reveal what's happening in videos without seeing pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether camera trajectory alone (without pixel data) can reveal video content, challenging the assumption that visual pixels are necessary for video understanding.

Method: Proposed CamFormer - a contrastive learning framework that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space aligned with natural language descriptions.

Result: Camera trajectory is surprisingly informative for uncovering video content, with CamFormer embeddings proving versatile for cross-modal alignment, classification, and temporal analysis tasks.

Conclusion: Camera trajectory serves as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for video content perception, working across different camera pose estimation methods.

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Canvas-to-Image is a unified framework that integrates multiple control modalities (text, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, layout) into a single canvas interface for high-fidelity compositional image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern diffusion models struggle with compositional and multimodal control when users specify multiple constraints simultaneously, requiring a unified approach to handle heterogeneous controls.

Method: Encodes diverse control signals into a composite canvas image and uses Multi-Task Canvas Training to optimize the diffusion model for joint understanding of multiple control modalities within a unified learning paradigm.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image enables faithful reflection of user intent through integrated visual-spatial reasoning across multiple control modalities, demonstrating strong generalization to multi-control scenarios.

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-based grasping methods struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. There's a need for task-oriented grasping that can identify correct object parts based on visual features and tasks.

Method: Given RGB image and task, uses LLM to identify parts to grasp/avoid, VLM to segment them, and generates 2D heatmap of actionable regions. Modular design with language-vision integration.

Result: Outperformed baselines on 20 household objects with 3 tasks each. 95% success in identifying/segmenting correct parts, 78.3% grasp success in real-world experiments. 80% success under occlusions in cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: OVAL-Grasp effectively enables task-oriented grasping using language-vision models, handles occlusions and visual features, and benefits from modular design as shown in ablation studies.

Abstract: To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

TL;DR: Two fast, memory-efficient feature selection algorithms for robot visual localization that reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual localization requires processing many image features, but many are redundant. Processing all features causes computational latency and inefficiency, motivating intelligent feature selection for real-time performance.

Method: Two novel feature selection algorithms that actively evaluate visual feature utility in real time, designed to reduce time and memory complexity.

Result: The methods achieve reduced computational and memory demands while maintaining a favorable trade-off between efficiency and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms enable efficient real-time visual feature selection for robot localization, overcoming limitations of existing computationally expensive approaches.

Abstract: Robot localization is a fundamental component of autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy.

Motivation: Current diffusion- and flow-based policies use fixed inference budgets regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple tasks and potential underperformance on challenging ones.

Method: Uses a difficulty classifier to dynamically select step budget, solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle, building on stochastic interpolant formulation for unified training and inference.

Result: Achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

Method: Developed COALA framework for semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling to reduce labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Proposed HawkEyeTrack (HETrack) method that enhances vision-language representation learning and improves UAV scenario perception.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of the AerialMind dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HETrack method in UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: AerialMind successfully bridges the research gap in UAV-based RMOT, providing a large-scale benchmark and effective method that enables precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions in aerial scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off in VIO systems where filter-based approaches are efficient but drift-prone, while optimization-based methods are accurate but computationally prohibitive for resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Proposes a dual-pronged RL policy: (1) Select Agent gates visual frontend using IMU data, (2) Fusion Agent estimates velocity via supervised network and adaptively fuses full state using RL policy.

Result: Achieves best average ATE on EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets while running 1.77x faster with less GPU memory than prior GPU-based systems, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced computational load.

Conclusion: The RL-based framework provides a favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off for VIO systems, enabling robust ego-motion estimation on resource-constrained platforms without sacrificing trajectory accuracy.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a critical component for robust ego-motion estimation, enabling foundational capabilities such as autonomous navigation in robotics and real-time 6-DoF tracking for augmented reality. Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge, requiring systems that can understand and follow social conventions in navigation.

Method: Uses a hierarchical 'brain-action' architecture with multi-stage training: imitation learning on the SocNav Dataset (7M samples with cognitive reasoning and expert trajectories), followed by SAFE-GRPO reinforcement learning that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors.

Result: Achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Conclusion: SocialNav successfully addresses the challenge of socially-aware navigation through its hierarchical architecture and comprehensive training pipeline, setting new benchmarks for socially compliant embodied navigation.

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-contact manipulation techniques are limited to microscopic scales (milligram range), creating a need for systems capable of manipulating larger objects in the gram range for industrial applications.

Method: Developed a magnetic levitation system with electromagnets optimized through numerical analysis, using deep reinforcement learning with action remapping to handle magnetic field nonlinearity and enable controller convergence.

Result: The system demonstrated flexible manipulation capabilities and could generalize to untrained transport tasks, with scalability potential for heavier objects using larger electromagnets.

Conclusion: Maglev-Pentabot provides a scalable framework for industrial-scale robotic applications, successfully extending non-contact manipulation from microscopic to gram-scale objects through DRL-based control strategies.

Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.

Method: Three-stage training pipeline: upper-body policy with heuristic reward function embedding forward kinematics priors, lower-body policy with force-based curriculum learning, and delta-command policy.

Result: The framework enables faster convergence and superior performance for upper body, while lower body can actively exert and regulate interaction forces with environment.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively bridges the gap for humanoid robots to handle both dexterity and proactive force interaction requirements in industrial settings.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like morphology, hold great potential for industrial applications. However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance. For the lower body, a force-based curriculum learning strategy is developed, enabling the robot to actively exert and regulate interaction forces with the environment.

*Ruican Xia,Hailong Pei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes dual preintegration method for relative state estimation between two mobile agents, addressing linearization errors in 6-DoF motion by integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms to enable efficient relinearization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relative state estimation accuracy degrades due to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, especially under large distances, causing drift and inconsistency in VR controller tracking during rapid HMD rotations.

Method: Dual preintegration integrates IMU preintegration from both platforms as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative states, supporting efficient relinearization. Includes observability analysis and null space formulation.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments show superior precision and robustness compared to SOTA algorithms, particularly in scenarios with multiple nonlinear rotations, bias observability, and varying background textures.

Conclusion: The dual preintegration method effectively mitigates linearization errors, providing more precise and robust relative state estimation than existing approaches in VR controller tracking applications.

Abstract: Relative State Estimation perform mutually localization between two mobile agents undergoing six-degree-of-freedom motion. Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective fabric alignment using synthetic training data, achieving zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios with different fabric textures.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.

Conclusion: The sampling-based optimization framework provides a robust alternative to learning-based approaches for bimanual manipulation in cluttered environments, with demonstrated real-time performance and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, dual-arm manipulation has become an area of strong interest in robotics, with end-to-end learning emerging as the predominant strategy for solving bimanual tasks. A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo. The paper concludes with a statistical analysis of the sample complexity and robustness, quantifying the performance of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous aerial robots to navigate unknown environments without maps using only onboard range sensing, addressing the challenge of collision avoidance in cluttered settings.

Method: Two cascaded neural networks: convolutional encoder compresses range images into latent vectors, and MLP approximates spatial SDF. This SDF parametrizes collision avoidance constraints in velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust/attitude commands.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms recursive feasibility and stability. Simulation tests show superior performance vs state-of-the-art methods and resilience to odometry drift. Real-world forest experiments demonstrate effective collision avoidance against adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: The neural NMPC framework successfully enables mapless collision-free navigation in unknown cluttered environments using onboard sensing, with proven theoretical guarantees and validated practical performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for mapless, collision-free navigation in unknown environments with Aerial Robots, using onboard range sensing. We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.

TL;DR: E0 is a discrete diffusion framework for robotic manipulation that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments with 10.7% average improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with generalization across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, often producing coarse or unstable actions. The discrete nature of real-world robot control (due to hardware constraints) motivates a discrete approach that better matches the true action distribution.

Method: E0 uses continuized discrete diffusion with quantized action tokens, enabling iterative denoising that aligns with pretrained VLM/VLA backbones. It employs spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation for camera shift robustness without additional data.

Result: E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average across 14 diverse environments. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms precise, robust, and transferable manipulation.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion represents a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning, offering better semantic conditioning, more accurate fine-grained control, and stronger generalization compared to continuous diffusion and other discrete approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA systems primarily use two-finger grippers which have inherent limitations in handling tasks requiring larger contact area or adhesion, such as wiping surfaces or opening handleless drawers.

Method: Developed a low-cost integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two-finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, supporting flexible switching or synergistic use of both manipulation modalities.

Result: Experimental validation within DexVLA and Pi0 frameworks shows robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that were infeasible for conventional two-finger grippers alone.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid end effector expands the range of feasible manipulation tasks for VLA systems, with hardware designs and controlling systems to be publicly released.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2E autonomous driving models perform well in open-loop but suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop deployment, creating a need for enhanced robustness and safety.

Method: Generate diverse counterfactual trajectories using geometry-consistent simulation, train diffusion-based policy adapter to refine predictions and multi-step Q value model for long-term evaluation, then select optimal trajectory at inference.

Result: Significant performance improvements across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios on nuScenes benchmark using photorealistic closed-loop simulator.

Conclusion: MPA effectively addresses robustness and safety gaps in E2E autonomous driving through counterfactual data generation and inference-time optimization, with data scale and guidance strategies being key factors.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.

*Lorenzo Shaikewitz,Charis Georgiou,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SLUE is a convex program that provides distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds for monocular pose estimation, using only high-probability noise bounds on 2D keypoint detections to generate ellipsoidal uncertainty sets guaranteed to contain the true pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods lack statistically rigorous uncertainty quantification without strict distributional assumptions, which is essential for robust robotics control and planning.

Method: Develop SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program that reduces implicit non-convex pose uncertainty constraints to ellipsoidal bounds using the S-lemma. Also extends to sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy for tighter bounds.

Result: SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds compared to prior work, validated on pose estimation datasets and real-world drone tracking.

Conclusion: SLUE provides statistically rigorous, distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds that are practical for robotics applications and can be projected to independent translation and orientation bounds.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

Conclusion: TraceGen's 3D trace-space representation enables efficient cross-embodiment learning without object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation, demonstrating strong adaptation capabilities from minimal demonstration data.

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.

### [140] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can automatically restructure hierarchies to optimize hyperbolic embeddings by increasing branching factor and enforcing single inheritance, leading to improved embedding quality across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic embeddings work best with hierarchies having high branching factor and single inheritance, but real-world hierarchies often don't meet these criteria. The paper investigates whether LLMs can automatically restructure existing hierarchies to optimize them for hyperbolic embeddings.

Method: Proposed a prompt-based approach using Large Language Models to transform existing hierarchies, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings (high branching factor, single inheritance). Experiments conducted on 16 diverse hierarchies.

Result: LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. The approach also enables explainable reorganizations with justifications for knowledge engineers.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies to meet hyperbolic embedding criteria, improving embedding quality while providing explainable transformations that assist knowledge engineers in hierarchy reorganization.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Conclusion: AssurAI enables development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community by providing comprehensive multimodal safety evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

*Mingming Zhao,Xiaokang Wei,Yuanqi Shao,Kaiwen Zhou,Lin Yang,Siwei Rao,Junhui Zhan,Zhitang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A²Flow is a fully automated framework that generates agentic workflows using self-adaptive abstraction operators, eliminating the need for manually predefined operators and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automating agentic workflow design heavily rely on manually predefined operators, which limits generalization and scalability.

Method: Three-stage operator extraction: 1) Case-based initial operator generation using expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning, 2) Operator clustering and preliminary abstraction across tasks, 3) Deep extraction for abstract execution operators using long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning. Enhanced with operator memory mechanism for workflow search.

Result: Achieves 2.4% and 19.3% average performance improvement on general and embodied benchmarks, and reduces resource usage by 37% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: A²Flow demonstrates that fully automated agentic workflow generation with self-adaptive abstraction operators is effective, outperforming existing methods while reducing resource consumption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalizability of Multimodal-CoT reasoning across diverse domains beyond science question answering, as current approaches have shown strong performance on science benchmarks but their cross-domain effectiveness remains underexplored.

Method: Implemented the two-stage framework from Zhang et al. that separates rationale generation from answer inference, using vision features integrated through gated fusion with T5-based language models. Conducted systematic ablation studies on A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets.

Result: Vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, but CoT reasoning effectiveness varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges despite the improvements.

Conclusion: The work provides practical insights for implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization, particularly addressing the challenges in commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

### [147] [Learning Multi-Access Point Coordination in Agentic AI Wi-Fi with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20719)
*Yifan Fan,Le Liang,Peng Liu,Xiao Li,Ziyang Guo,Qiao Lan,Shi Jin,Wen Tong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where APs act as autonomous LLM agents that collaboratively reason about network states and negotiate adaptive coordination strategies in real-time, outperforming static MAPC protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPC protocols use static, predefined rules that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions like varying interference and topologies, limiting performance in dense Wi-Fi environments.

Method: Models each access point as an autonomous LLM agent that uses natural language dialogue, integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to collaboratively reason about network states and negotiate adaptive coordination strategies.

Result: Comprehensive simulations show the agentic framework successfully adapts to diverse dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks by enabling dynamic, adaptive coordination through agent collaboration.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenApps is a lightweight open-source ecosystem with six configurable apps that enables testing UI-Agents across thousands of app variations, revealing significant reliability fluctuations (up to 50%+ success rate differences) that aren't captured by traditional fixed-environment evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous UI-Agent evaluations use fixed app environments, which fail to measure reliability across real-world variations in app design and content that agents encounter when deployed.

Method: Developed OpenApps - a lightweight ecosystem with 6 configurable apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that can generate thousands of app versions and run on a single CPU, enabling 10,000+ evaluations across 7 leading multimodal agents.

Result: Agent reliability varies drastically across app variations - task success rates fluctuate by more than 50% (e.g., Kimi-VL-3B drops from 63% to 4% success). Agent behaviors like looping and hallucinating actions also differ significantly based on environment configuration.

Conclusion: Measuring reliability across app variations is crucial for autonomous UI-Agents, as traditional fixed-environment evaluations miss significant performance fluctuations that occur in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

TL;DR: RILKE is a representation-space intervention method that enables efficient lifelong knowledge updates in LLMs without retraining, achieving high edit success and generalization while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce incorrect/outdated content, and updating their knowledge efficiently without costly retraining is challenging, especially for complex unstructured knowledge in lifelong settings where many edits must coexist without interference.

Method: Treats knowledge control as interventions in representation space, learning paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit updates to low-dimensional subspaces to minimize interference, with a query-adaptive router for inference.

Result: Achieves high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserves general utility with modest memory overhead on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, scalable to large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs, enabling fine-grained control over complex knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

### [150] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations of neuron activations in neural networks, addressing limitations of beam search methods that lack theoretical optimality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanations use beam search to describe neuron-concept alignments, but this approach cannot provide theoretical guarantees of optimality, leaving it unclear how close explanations are to the true optimum.

Method: The authors propose: (i) a decomposition identifying factors influencing spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate alignment during search, and (iii) the first algorithm that computes optimal compositional explanations within feasible time.

Result: Analysis shows that 10-40% of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. A beam-search variant guided by the proposed decomposition matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework enables computation of guaranteed optimal compositional explanations, revealing significant suboptimality in current beam search approaches and providing more reliable neuron interpretation methods.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

TL;DR: ENACT is a benchmark that evaluates embodied cognition in vision-language models through world modeling tasks using egocentric interaction in VQA format, revealing performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modern vision-language models exhibit signs of embodied cognition despite being trained in disembodied ways, by creating a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Created ENACT benchmark with forward world modeling (reorder observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder actions given observations) tasks using robotics simulation data from BEHAVIOR, evaluating on 8,972 QA pairs from home-scale activities.

Result: Found performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon, models perform better on inverse tasks than forward ones, and exhibit anthropocentric biases including right-handed action preference and sensitivity to camera viewpoint deviations.

Conclusion: ENACT provides a principled framework to evaluate embodied cognition in VLMs, revealing current limitations and biases, suggesting need for more embodied training approaches.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

TL;DR: Ivy is an AI coaching system that combines symbolic TMK models with LLMs to generate structured, multi-step explanations for procedural skills, outperforming GPT baselines in explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce fluent but shallow explanations that miss the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic needed for effective procedural skill instruction.

Method: Combines symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative LLM layer, where TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions to constrain the LLM's explanation generation.

Result: Symbolic constraints consistently improve structural quality of explanations for 'how' and 'why' questions across three inferential dimensions, outperforming GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable AI for education method that enhances pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes ICPO, a method that uses LLMs' intrinsic generation probabilities to calculate preference advantage scores, which are combined with verifiable rewards to improve reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, leading to unstable training and entropy collapse in LLM reasoning tasks.

Method: ICPO calculates preference advantage scores by comparing relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same prompt, then integrates these scores with verifiable rewards to guide exploration.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain and three mathematical benchmarks show that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning performance compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: ICPO effectively addresses RLVR limitations by leveraging intrinsic confidence measures, improving exploration and preventing overfitting while enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [154] [Towards Trustworthy Legal AI through LLM Agents and Formal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21033)
*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L4M is a framework that combines LLM agents with SMT-solver proofs to bridge natural language interpretation and symbolic verification in legal reasoning, outperforming existing LLMs and legal AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based systems lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence, excelling only at surface-level text analysis without rigorous verification.

Method: Three-phase pipeline: (1) Statute Formalization converts legal provisions to logical formulae, (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction uses prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs for independent fact mapping with role isolation, (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication compiles arguments into logic constraints with iterative self-critique via unsat cores.

Result: Experimental results show the system surpasses advanced LLMs (GPT-4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Claude 4) and state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines.

Conclusion: L4M successfully unites interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification, providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications for legal decisions.

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection using a Visual Chain-of-Thought approach with weakly Markovian decision processes and bandit exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection methods have a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference, and textual space remains underexplored despite its importance for OVOD performance.

Method: Proposes OVOD-Agent with Visual-CoT paradigm, models visual context transitions as Weakly Markovian Decision Process over eight state spaces, uses Bandit module for exploration signals, and integrates Markov transitions with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model optimization.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS show consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the training-inference gap in OVOD and demonstrates the power of proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper abstracts Halpern and Pearl's causality definition to work with any model that defines counterfactuals, enabling broader applications including handling complex formulas with disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Halpern and Pearl's influential causality definition beyond causal models, allowing it to work with any model that defines counterfactuals and handle more complex logical constructs.

Method: Abstracting the key features of Halpern-Pearl's causality definition to create a more general framework that can be applied to any model with counterfactuals, including those allowing backtracking.

Result: The abstracted definition can handle formulas with disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals - cases that the original Halpern-Pearl definition cannot address.

Conclusion: Abstracting the causality definition provides broader applicability, enables extension to explanation concepts beyond causal models, and offers deeper insights into the original definition's features.

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web introduces a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from LLM reading to programmatic pruning, achieving 25x-50x reduction in candidate elements and improving grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based web agents struggle with navigating complex webpages due to prohibitively large DOM structures (10k-100k tokens), relying on crude truncation or inefficient heuristics that risk losing critical information.

Method: DOM Tree Pruning Programming where LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks, eliminating the need for LLMs to ingest raw DOMs.

Result: Achieves 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, dramatically improves low-level grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Prune4Web effectively addresses DOM scalability challenges in web automation through programmatic pruning, enabling precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution in real-world web automation tasks.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatDRex is a conversation-based multi-agent system that enables natural language access to biomedical knowledge graphs for network-based drug repurposing prediction, making complex bioinformatics analyses accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug repurposing is time-efficient and cost-effective but challenging due to fragmented algorithms, heterogeneous data, and the need for multi-disciplinary collaboration. Existing tools don't integrate well across workflows.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system with specialized agents for query routing, data retrieval from NeDRex knowledge graph, network analysis, drug repurposing prediction, functional coherence evaluation, literature mining, and result visualization. Includes reasoning module for hallucination detection.

Result: Provides natural language interface to complex bioinformatics workflows, enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to generate drug repurposing hypotheses and explore opportunities.

Conclusion: ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics for drug repurposing, accelerating discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research by keeping users in the loop.

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme weather events are increasing globally, but current diagnostic methods are labor-intensive and create analytical bottlenecks, while AI has focused mainly on prediction rather than diagnostic reasoning.

Method: EWE emulates expert workflows using knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit to autonomously produce and interpret multimodal visualizations from raw data.

Conclusion: EWE represents progress toward automated scientific discovery and has potential to democratize expertise, especially benefiting developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

*Junjian Wang,Lidan Zhao,Xi Sheryl Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MADRA is a training-free multi-agent debate framework for embodied AI safety that uses collective reasoning to assess task risks without sacrificing performance, achieving over 90% unsafe task rejection while maintaining low safe-task rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embodied AI safety suffer from high computational costs from preference alignment training or over-rejection with single-agent safety prompts, creating barriers for real-world deployment in household environments.

Method: Proposes MADRA framework with multiple LLM agents debating instruction safety guided by a critical evaluator scoring responses on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Uses iterative deliberation and consensus voting, plus hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning integrating safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution.

Result: Achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while keeping safe-task rejection low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents through collective reasoning and continuous learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical spatial cognition framework with 5 levels and introduces SpatialBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 tasks to systematically evaluate multimodal large language models' spatial reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify spatial cognition as a single-dimensional metric, failing to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities in multimodal intelligence.

Method: Developed a hierarchical spatial cognition framework with 5 progressively complex levels, constructed SpatialBench with 15 tasks aligned with these levels, and introduced a unified capability-oriented metric for evaluation.

Result: Experiments revealed distinct performance stratification: models show strong perceptual grounding but limitations in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Human tests showed humans perform goal-directed abstraction while MLLMs over-attend to surface details.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

### [163] [Pessimistic Verification for Open Ended Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21522)
*Yanxing Huang,Zihan Tang,Zejin Lin,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pessimistic verification uses multiple parallel verifications for math proofs, deeming a proof incorrect if any verification reports an error, significantly improving performance across math benchmarks with high token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key limitation in verification performance is error detection ability, leading to the design of pessimistic verification to improve verification of open-ended math questions.

Method: Construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, where the proof is deemed incorrect if any one verification reports an error.

Result: Significantly improves performance across many math verification benchmarks without substantial computational resources, with token efficiency surpassing extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Case studies show false negatives are often due to dataset annotation errors.

Conclusion: Self-verification for mathematical problems improves reliability and performance of language model outputs, and pessimistic verification research will enhance mathematical capabilities of language models across various tasks.

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

### [164] [Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569)
*Alex Diep*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models show inconsistent AI identity disclosure across professional domains, with disclosure rates varying dramatically (2.8%-73.6%) based on assigned personas rather than model size, creating trust risks in high-stakes contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models can reliably disclose their AI identity when assigned professional personas in high-stakes domains, where false expertise could harm users who cannot verify the model's competence boundaries.

Method: Used a common-garden design to audit 16 open-weight models (4B-671B parameters) across 19,200 trials, testing disclosure rates across different professional personas (Financial Advisor, Neurosurgeon, etc.) and analyzing the impact of model identity, parameter count, and reasoning optimization.

Result: Models showed sharp domain-specific inconsistency: Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure vs Neurosurgeon's 3.5%. Disclosure ranged widely (2.8%-73.6%), with model identity being a better predictor than parameter count. Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models (up to 48.4% lower disclosure).

Conclusion: Transparency reflects training factors rather than scale, creating a 'Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia' effect where users overgeneralize trust. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts and require deliberate behavior design with empirical verification.

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'responsible computational foresight' - a framework combining human-centric AI and computational modeling to help policymakers navigate future uncertainties ethically and proactively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In an era of rapid technological change and complex global challenges, there's a need for ethical frameworks that help policymakers anticipate future opportunities and risks while ensuring sustainable and accountable future design.

Method: Establishes foundational principles for responsible computational foresight and presents AI-driven foresight tools that work with simulations and scenario analysis to enhance policymakers' ability to address uncertainty and evaluate risks.

Result: AI is positioned as a supportive tool that complements rather than replaces human judgment in foresight practices, enabling more resilient and ethically sound futures through enhanced risk evaluation and strategy development.

Conclusion: Advocates for thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities in addressing 21st century challenges, emphasizing that responsible foresight requires understanding complex system interdependencies and maintaining ethical, long-term decision-making.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with planning and state tracking in the 8-puzzle task, showing limitations in maintaining internal state and heuristic planning even with corrective feedback and external move validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly assess LLMs' capacity for planning and stateful reasoning without relying on code execution or external tools, using the 8-puzzle as a precise evaluation framework.

Method: Tested four LLMs on 8-puzzle tasks under various prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) with tiered corrective feedback, and examined them with external move validation.

Result: Feedback improved some model-prompt combinations but successful runs were inefficient. With external move validation, no models solved any puzzles. Models showed brittle state representations and weak heuristic planning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning without external tools, requiring mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and structured search for further progress.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML models amplify human biases and have unintended consequences. Responsible AI advocates need richer causal models from system dynamics, but face barriers due to different underlying assumptions between disciplines.

Method: Develops a common mathematical framework that combines system dynamics and structural equation modeling to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results.

Result: Creates a unified framework that bridges system dynamics and structural equation modeling for AI/ML applications.

Conclusion: The integrated framework can inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications, helping address bias and unintended consequences in AI systems.

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

Motivation: Current memory-augmented agents only store single-modality trajectories, losing essential domain knowledge and failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to solutions, which misaligns with human multimodal semantic memory.

Method: ViLoMem constructs compact, schema-based memory with separate encoding of visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, following a grow-and-refine principle to incrementally accumulate and update multimodal semantic knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors, with ablations confirming the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction-hallucination separation.

Conclusion: ViLoMem demonstrates the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning, enabling MLLMs to learn from their experiences through coordinated but distinct representational streams.

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.
