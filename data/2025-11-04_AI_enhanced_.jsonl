While recent advances in deep\nlearning (DL) have facilitated automated segmentation, challenges remain in\nachieving robust performance across diverse datasets and complex clinical\ncases. We present an annotated dataset stemming from a bootstrapped DL-based\nframework for iterative segmentation and quality refinement of VS in MRI. We\ncombine data from multiple centres and rely on expert consensus for\ntrustworthiness of the annotations. We show that our approach enables effective\nand resource-efficient generalisation of automated segmentation models to a\ntarget data distribution. The framework achieved a significant improvement in\nsegmentation accuracy with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) increase from\n0.9125 to 0.9670 on our target internal validation dataset, while maintaining\nstable performance on representative external datasets. Expert evaluation on\n143 scans further highlighted areas for model refinement, revealing nuanced\ncases where segmentation required expert intervention. The proposed approach is\nestimated to enhance efficiency by approximately 37.4% compared to the\nconventional manual annotation process. Overall, our human-in-the-loop model\ntraining approach achieved high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its\npotential as a clinically adaptable and generalisable strategy for automated VS\nsegmentation in diverse clinical settings. The dataset includes 190 patients,\nwith tumour annotations available for 534 longitudinal contrast-enhanced\nT1-weighted (T1CE) scans from 184 patients, and non-annotated T2-weighted scans\nfrom 6 patients.
