Intuitively, such\nrequirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable\nenvironment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,\ncode). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for\ngenerating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.
