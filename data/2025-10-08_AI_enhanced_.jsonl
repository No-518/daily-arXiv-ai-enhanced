To address this issue, many previous works have\nattempted to extract key video information, where the \"key\" is typically\nsemantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,\nwe propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion\npriors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.\nFlow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial\nlevels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)\nadaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow\npriors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to\nfilter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)\nfurther refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy\nvideo tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide\nrange of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding\ntasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flow4Agent is a novel framework that uses optical flow motion priors to address redundancy in long-form video understanding for MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "motivation": "Long-form video understanding is challenging due to temporal and spatial redundancy, exacerbated by limited MLLM context length.

After being trained on the\nrelatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it\nachieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs\nmultiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at\nreal-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human\nmesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a\nsingle unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong\nbaseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in\nhttps://fanegg.github.io/Human3R", "AI": {"tldr": "Human3R is a unified feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction from monocular videos, jointly recovering global multi-person SMPL-X bodies, dense 3D scenes, and camera trajectories in a single forward pass without iterative refinement.", "motivation": "To overcome limitations of previous multi-stage pipelines that rely on iterative contact-aware refinement and heavy dependencies like human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, aiming for a more efficient and unified approach.", "method": "Builds upon CUT3R using parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning to preserve spatiotemporal priors while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies in a single forward pass.", "result": "Achieves real-time performance (15 FPS) with low memory footprint (8 GB) after training on BEDLAM dataset for one day on one GPU, delivering state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks including human motion estimation, mesh recovery, depth estimation, and camera pose estimation.", "conclusion": "Human3R serves as a simple yet strong baseline for unified human-scene reconstruction that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement, enabling easy extension for downstream applications."}}
