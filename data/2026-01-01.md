*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular depth estimation for robotic surgery using Depth Anything V2 priors adapted with DV-LORA, achieving SOTA results with 98.1% accuracy on SCARED dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised MDE methods fail in endoscopic environments with specular reflections and fluids, suffering from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces.

Method: Leverage Depth Anything V2's synthetic priors for geometric detail, adapt to medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA) for efficient parameter tuning, and introduce physically-stratified evaluation protocol on SCARED dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art with 98.1% accuracy (< 1.25) and reduces Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges synthetic-to-real gap for surgical depth estimation, providing robust performance in challenging endoscopic environments with specular reflections.

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

TL;DR: Video-based assessment pipeline for urban warfare training using computer vision to extract performance metrics from training videos without extra hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for assessing military training (like Enter and Clear the Room drills) rely on costly sensors or subjective observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. Need automated, objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills in synthetic training environments.

Method: Computer vision models extract 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories from training videos. Task-specific metrics measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis hierarchy with weighted combination to generate overall performance scores.

Result: Demonstrated with real-world ECR drills, providing actionable domain-specific metrics capturing individual and team performance. Supports After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards in Gamemaster and GIFT for intuitive feedback.

Conclusion: Video-based approach enables scalable evaluation in synthetic training environments without additional hardware. Limitations include tracking difficulties and ground-truth validation. Future work includes 3D video analysis and broader applicability.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFP is a neural network that compresses long videos into short contexts while preserving high-frequency details of individual frames, enabling efficient long-term memory for autoregressive video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient long video processing by compressing lengthy sequences into short contexts while maintaining visual quality, allowing autoregressive video models to have long history memory without excessive computational cost.

Method: PFP uses a neural network structure with explicit pretraining objective to preserve high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions, compressing 20-second videos into ~5k length contexts.

Result: The model successfully compresses videos while allowing random frame retrieval with perceptually preserved appearances, and can be fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models with low context cost and minimal fidelity loss.

Conclusion: PFP provides an effective framework for video compression that balances context length reduction with visual quality preservation, enabling practical long-term memory capabilities for video generation models.

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

### [4] [Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860)
*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes lifelong domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation to handle non-stationary target datasets, using a novel GAN framework with specialized 3D pose generators to mitigate domain shifts and prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain adaptation methods for 3D HPE struggle with non-stationary target datasets and fail to handle sequential adaptation to multiple domains while preserving knowledge from previous domains.

Method: Introduces lifelong domain adaptation setting for 3D HPE with a GAN framework containing 3D pose generators, 2D pose discriminator, and 3D pose estimator. Uses pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge integration in the generator to enhance adaptation and prevent forgetting.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: First to introduce lifelong domain adaptation to 3D HPE, successfully addressing challenges of adapting to current domains while preserving knowledge from previous domains through innovative GAN framework and specialized pose generator design.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

### [5] [MRI-to-CT Synthesis With Cranial Suture Segmentations Using A Variational Autoencoder Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23894)
*Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Athelia Paulli,Gabrielle Dickerson,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Natasha Lepore,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning pipeline transforms pediatric T1-weighted MRIs into synthetic CTs for cranial bone and suture segmentation, enabling non-invasive assessment of cranial development without radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT scans provide detailed cranial bone and suture information but expose children to harmful radiation. MRI is radiation-free but cannot visualize cranial sutures or assess bone density. There's a critical need for non-invasive methods to evaluate pediatric cranial development.

Method: Proposed a deep learning pipeline using domain-specific variational autoencoders to transform T1-weighted MRIs of children (0.2-2 years) into synthetic CTs. The pipeline predicts cranial bone segmentation, generates suture probability heatmaps, and derives direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps.

Result: Synthetic CTs achieved 99% structural similarity and Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained 85% Dice coefficient across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence between synthetic and real CT segmentations was statistically confirmed (TOST p < 0.05).

Conclusion: This is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework enabling suture segmentation from MRI, bridging critical gaps in non-invasive cranial evaluation. The method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial synthetic CTs from routine pediatric MRIs despite MRI's limited bone depiction.

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

### [6] [Scaling Remote Sensing Foundation Models: Data Domain Tradeoffs at the Peta-Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23903)
*Charith Wickrema,Eliza Mace,Hunter Brown,Heidys Cabrera,Nick Krall,Matthew O'Neill,Shivangi Sarkar,Lowell Weissman,Eric Hughes,Guido Zarrella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaling laws for training foundation models on massive satellite imagery datasets, showing data-limited regime persists even at petascale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to establish scaling behaviors for AI training on high-resolution EO datasets, as existing scaling laws from natural images don't apply well to remote sensing domains where data is more limited and specialized.

Method: Train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data in the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, analyzing scaling behaviors at petascale.

Result: Even at massive scale (petascale), performance remains in data-limited regime rather than model parameter-limited regime, with observations of success/failure modes for bridging domain gaps across RS modalities.

Conclusion: Practical insights for data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules to advance frontier-scale remote sensing foundation models, highlighting continued data limitations despite massive scale.

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

### [7] [Learning to learn skill assessment for fetal ultrasound scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23920)
*Yipei Wang,Qianye Yang,Lior Drukker,Aris T. Papageorghiou,Yipeng Hu,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel bi-level optimization framework for automated fetal ultrasound skill assessment without predefined skill ratings, using task performance on acquired images as skill indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound skill assessment relies on subjective expert supervision. Previous automated methods use supervised learning with predetermined skill factors, limiting analysis to assumed influential factors.

Method: Bi-level optimization framework with clinical task predictor and skill predictor networks optimized jointly. Skill is assessed by how well tasks are performed on acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings.

Result: Validated on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of fetal head scanning. Demonstrates feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by quantifying optimized task performance as skill indicator.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables automated ultrasound skill assessment without subjective expert ratings, using task performance as objective skill measurement.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

### [8] [MGML: A Plug-and-Play Meta-Guided Multi-Modal Learning Framework for Incomplete Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23936)
*Yulong Zou,Bo Liu,Cun-Jing Zheng,Yuan-ming Geng,Siyue Li,Qiankun Zuo,Shuihua Wang,Yudong Zhang,Jin Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGML framework uses meta-guided learning for brain tumor segmentation with incomplete multimodal MRI data, achieving state-of-the-art results on BraTS datasets through adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal MRI data is crucial for brain tumor segmentation but often incomplete in clinical practice, creating a need for methods that can effectively utilize available incomplete multimodal information.

Method: Proposes meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) with two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) that generates adaptive soft-label supervision for coherent multimodal fusion, and a consistency regularization module that enhances segmentation and framework robustness.

Result: Achieved superior performance on BraTS2020 with average Dice scores of 87.55 (WT), 79.36 (TC), and 62.67 (ET) across fifteen missing modality combinations, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The MGML framework effectively addresses incomplete multimodal MRI data challenges without altering original model architecture, providing a practical solution for clinical brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view geo-localization system using DINOv2 backbone with convolution adapter, multi-scale channel reallocation, and MoE-enhanced aggregation achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization faces significant challenges due to viewpoint discrepancies that hinder effective feature aggregation and alignment between query images and database images.

Method: Three key improvements: 1) DINOv2 backbone with convolution adapter fine-tuning for cross-view adaptation, 2) multi-scale channel reallocation module for diverse spatial representations, 3) improved aggregation module with Mixture-of-Experts routing in cross-attention framework for adaptive processing of heterogeneous domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate competitive performance with fewer trained parameters compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CVGL system effectively addresses viewpoint discrepancy challenges through adaptive feature processing and achieves efficient cross-view geo-localization with reduced parameter requirements.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

*Yan Meng,Daniel Donoho,Marcelle Altshuler,Omar Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI framework automates action segmentation and skill assessment in microanastomosis surgery using object tracking, self-similarity matrices, and classification, achieving 92.4% segmentation and 85.5% skill classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microanastomosis assessment relies on subjective expert evaluation prone to variability and time-consuming. Need for objective, automated, scalable solutions to improve surgical training and competency assessment.

Method: Three-component AI framework: 1) YOLO+DeepSORT for instrument tip tracking, 2) self-similarity matrix for unsupervised action boundary detection and clustering, 3) supervised classification for gesture proficiency evaluation.

Result: Achieved 92.4% frame-level action segmentation accuracy and 85.5% overall skill classification accuracy on 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos, demonstrating effective replication of expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The AI framework enables objective, real-time feedback for microsurgical education, supporting standardized data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

TL;DR: DehazeSNN: A novel U-Net-like Spiking Neural Network architecture for efficient image dehazing that addresses limitations of CNNs and Transformers while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dehazing methods rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning approaches (CNNs and Transformers) have limitations: CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers require heavy computational resources.

The design captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing both local and long-range dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show DehazeSNN is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with smaller model size and fewer multiply-accumulate operations (MACs).

Conclusion: DehazeSNN provides an efficient alternative to traditional CNNs and Transformers for image dehazing, offering superior performance with reduced computational requirements, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations.

*Changzhen Li,Yuecong Min,Jie Zhang,Zheng Yuan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VAttack: First comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on Text-to-Video diffusion models, revealing vulnerabilities through semantic and temporal attacks that degrade video quality with minimal prompt modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid advances in Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models generating high-quality videos, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored, creating a critical security gap in these increasingly important AI systems.

Method: Proposes T2VAttack framework with two attack objectives (semantic for video-text alignment, temporal for temporal dynamics) and two attack methods: T2VAttack-S (replaces critical words with synonyms via greedy search) and T2VAttack-I (iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation).

Result: Evaluation on state-of-the-art T2V models (ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, HunyuanVideo) shows even minor prompt modifications (single word substitution/insertion) cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: Current T2V diffusion models have critical vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for improved robustness and security measures in video generation systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

*Yuang Jia,Jinlong Wang,Jiayi Zhao,Chunlam Li,Shunzhou Wang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel view extrapolation method for autonomous driving that uses only images and optional camera poses, combining 4D Gaussian reconstruction with iterative diffusion model refinement to generate high-quality novel views without expensive sensors or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing view extrapolation methods rely on expensive sensors (LiDAR) or labor-intensive annotations (3D bounding boxes, lane markings), limiting real-world applicability. The authors aim to develop a solution using only images and optional camera poses.

Method: 1) Estimate global static and per-frame dynamic point clouds from images/camera poses, 2) Use deformable 4D Gaussian framework for scene reconstruction, 3) Train video diffusion model on degraded renders from initial 4D Gaussian, 4) Iteratively refine progressively shifted Gaussian renderings with diffusion model, 5) Use enhanced results to retrain 4D Gaussian until reaching target viewpoints.

Result: The method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints compared to baselines, demonstrating effective view extrapolation without expensive sensors or annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables high-quality view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios using only images and optional camera poses, overcoming limitations of sensor-dependent methods and expanding real-world applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Motivation: Current satellite change detection struggles with atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts, limiting rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring capabilities.

Method: Train an inpainting model on SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct last frame of Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data across diverse climates and land cover types.

Result: Detected earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake with higher sensitivity/specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli methods, achieving 3x lower detection thresholds.

Conclusion: Deep learning temporal redundancy approach enables unprecedented sensitivity for automated, global-scale surface change monitoring using freely available satellite data.

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

*Jun Ding,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCA-ResUNet: A lightweight medical image segmentation framework with Grouped Coordinate Attention module that improves global context modeling while maintaining CNN efficiency, outperforming both CNN and Transformer methods on Synapse and ACDC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current U-Net based CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in multi-organ segmentation and low-contrast regions due to local receptive fields, while Transformer methods require excessive computational resources unsuitable for clinical deployment.

Method: Proposes GCA-ResUNet with Grouped Coordinate Attention module that decouples channel-wise context into groups to handle semantic heterogeneity, and uses direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal/vertical axes.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse and 92.64% on ACDC, outperforming Swin-UNet, TransUNet, and other CNN/Transformer methods, with particular improvements in small anatomical structures with complex boundaries.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet provides an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical, scalable solution for clinical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

*Haotang Li,Zhenyu Qi,Hao Qin,Huanrui Yang,Sen He,Kebin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GASeg improves self-supervised semantic segmentation by using topological information to bridge appearance and geometry, addressing appearance ambiguities through a novel DBC module, TopoAug adversarial augmentation, and GALoss for cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail due to over-reliance on unstable appearance-based features like shadows, glare, and local textures, which are ambiguous in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes GASeg framework with three key components: 1) Differentiable Box-Counting (DBC) module that quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from geometric and appearance feature streams, 2) Topological Augmentation (TopoAug) that applies morphological operators to simulate real-world ambiguities, and 3) GALoss that enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric and appearance features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating the effectiveness of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Conclusion: Bridging appearance and geometry through stable topological information effectively addresses appearance ambiguities in self-supervised semantic segmentation, leading to improved performance across multiple challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

*Tae Ha Park,Simone D'Amico*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel pipeline for 3D spacecraft reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting with sun position priors to handle dynamic space lighting, enabling both geometry recovery and camera pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS requires static scenes, but spaceborne imagery during RPO has dynamic lighting conditions. Accurate photometric rendering is crucial for downstream camera pose estimation tasks in spacecraft operations.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting model with incorporation of Sun position priors (estimated by servicer spacecraft) into training pipeline to improve photometric quality and handle changing illumination conditions.

Result: Experimental studies show 3DGS models learn to adapt to rapidly changing space illumination, accurately reflecting global shadowing and self-occlusion effects in rendered images.

Conclusion: Incorporating sun position knowledge enables effective 3D spacecraft reconstruction from RPO imagery despite dynamic lighting, supporting both geometry recovery and pose estimation for space operations.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hilbert-VLM: A two-stage fusion framework combining Hilbert-enhanced SAM2 for 3D medical image segmentation with prompt-guided VLM for disease classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on BraTS2021.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D multimodal medical images due to ineffective integration of complementary information and oversight of subtle pathological features, limiting their potential for automated medical diagnosis.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) HilbertMed-SAM module with Hilbert space-filling curves in Mamba SSM scanning, Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention, and scale-aware decoder for precise lesion segmentation; 2) Prompt enhancement module that unifies segmentation masks with textual attributes to guide VLM for disease classification.

Result: Achieves Dice score of 82.35% on BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark and diagnostic classification accuracy of 78.85%, demonstrating superior performance in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: Hilbert-VLM significantly improves accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis by effectively integrating 3D multimodal information and capturing subtle pathological features through innovative Hilbert-space and Mamba SSM integration.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CVC introduces a dual-branch velocity correction framework for flow-based diffusion editing that decomposes latent evolution into structure-preserving and semantically-guided components, with posterior-consistent updates to reduce trajectory drift and improve fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-based diffusion editing methods suffer from accumulated velocity errors in latent trajectories, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity during image distribution transformations.

Method: Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC) reformulates flow-based editing as distribution transformation with dual-perspective velocity conversion: structure-preserving branch maintains source consistency, semantically-guided branch drives controlled deviation toward target. Uses posterior-consistent updates derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction to compensate for velocity errors.

Result: CVC achieves stable and interpretable latent dynamics with faithful reconstruction and smooth semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments show superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CVC provides a principled framework for flow-based diffusion editing that addresses velocity error accumulation through dual-branch decomposition and mathematically-grounded error compensation, resulting in improved semantic consistency and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

*Lu Yang,Yicheng Liu,Yanan Li,Xiang Bai,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FitControler is a plug-in module for virtual try-on models that enables customized garment fit control, addressing both layout delineation and garment rendering challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VTON methods focus on garment detail rendering but neglect garment fit, which is fundamental to fashion design and holistic style coordination. Garment fit determines how clothing aligns with the body and shapes overall appearance.

Method: FitControler features: 1) fit-aware layout generator that redraws body-garment layouts using garment-agnostic representations, and 2) multi-scale fit injector that delivers layout cues for layout-driven VTON. The method is built on Fit4Men dataset with 13,000 body-garment pairs of varying fits, camera distances, and poses.

Result: FitControler works with various VTON models and achieves accurate fit control. Two new fit consistency metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate effective integration and performance.

Conclusion: The paper introduces fit-aware VTON and FitControler as a learnable plug-in that enables customized fit control, addressing a key gap in realistic virtual try-on systems. The approach is validated through comprehensive experiments and a new dataset.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: Structure-guided 2D Gaussian Splatting improves compression efficiency by coupling image structure with representation capacity and quantization precision while maintaining fast decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2DGS-based image compression methods allocate representation capacity and parameter precision without considering image structure, limiting their rate-distortion efficiency at low bitrates.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Structure-guided initialization for localized Gaussian distribution, 2) Adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters based on region complexity, 3) Geometry-consistent regularization aligning Gaussian orientations with local gradients.

Result: Substantial improvement in both representational power and RD performance while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Achieved 43.44% BD-rate reduction on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K compared to baseline GSImage.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-guided allocation principle successfully couples image structure with representation capacity and quantization precision, enabling more efficient 2DGS-based image compression without sacrificing decoding speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with remote sensing images due to differences from natural images, failing to extract fine-grained features and suffering from visual forgetting during deep language processing.

Method: Multi-scale visual representation learning combines global context with local details, plus recurrent visual feature injection to keep language model grounded in visual evidence and reduce forgetting.

Conclusion: MF-RSVLM effectively addresses remote sensing VLM challenges through multi-feature fusion and recurrent visual injection, with publicly available code for community use.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation.

TL;DR: RSAgent is an agentic MLLM that performs text-guided object segmentation through multi-turn reasoning and tool invocations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided segmentation methods treat it as one-shot grounding, which limits verification, refocusing, and refinement when initial localization is wrong. This approach lacks iterative improvement capabilities.

Method: Proposes RSAgent, an agentic MLLM that interleaves reasoning and action via multi-turn tool invocations. It queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises spatial hypotheses using historical observations. Uses a two-stage training framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards.

Result: Achieves 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test (9% improvement over Seg-Zero-7B) and 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: RSAgent's agentic approach with multi-turn reasoning and tool invocations effectively addresses limitations of one-shot segmentation methods, enabling iterative refinement and achieving superior segmentation performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video editing faces computational bottlenecks due to high costs of joint editing and DDIM inversion across extended sequences, limiting scalability.

Method: Three innovations: 1) Motion analysis (SSIM + Optical Flow) to skip editing low-motion frames, 2) Pipelined task scheduling that segments videos for parallel DDIM inversion/editing, 3) Neural interpolation to smooth segment borders and fill skipped frames.

Result: Achieves up to 9.6X speedup over TokenFlow and 31.7X speedup over DMT, with linear time scaling enabling editing of infinitely long videos.

Conclusion: PipeFlow provides a scalable solution for long-form video editing by addressing computational bottlenecks through intelligent frame skipping, parallel processing, and interpolation techniques.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based anisotropic diffusion framework for image denoising that outperforms traditional diffusion methods and competes with deep CNN approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anisotropic diffusion methods use explicit diffusion operators that are not well adapted to complex image structures, limiting their performance compared to learning-based approaches.

Method: Trainable anisotropic diffusion framework using reinforcement learning, modeling denoising as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning.

Result: Outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with representative deep CNN-based methods on three types of noise removal.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning approach creates a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, improving upon traditional diffusion methods.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

TL;DR: NIRNL is a robust cross-modal retrieval framework that handles noisy labels through cross-modal margin preserving and neighbor-aware instance refining with tailored optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal data annotation is expensive and often contains noise, which degrades retrieval performance. Existing robust CMR methods fail to simultaneously satisfy performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rates.

Method: Proposes NIRNL with two main components: 1) Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust relative distances between positive/negative pairs for better discrimination, and 2) Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) that identifies pure, hard, and noisy subsets through cross-modal neighborhood consensus, then applies tailored optimization strategies for each subset.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Conclusion: NIRNL effectively handles noisy labels in cross-modal retrieval by combining margin preserving with fine-grained instance refining and tailored optimization, maximizing data utilization while mitigating error propagation.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Motivation: Current DNNs for ocular disease diagnosis ignore clinical pathology context and expert experience priors, limiting both performance and interpretability of decision-making.

Method: Developed Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage pathology context via pixel-wise context compression and distribution concentration operators, and Expert Prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to highlight significant regions using expert experience. Combined these with Integrated Loss (IL) considering sample-wise loss distributions and label frequencies.

Result: PCRNet with IL outperforms state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods on three ocular disease datasets, with visualization analysis explaining PRM and EPGA's impact on DNN decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed PCRNet framework successfully integrates clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve both performance and interpretability in ocular disease recognition, demonstrating the value of incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning models.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

Motivation: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets use hierarchical labels, but embedding semantic hierarchy into representation learning is challenging. Previous methods using hierarchical contrastive learning overlook two issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution causing high-frequency classes to dominate learning, and (2) semantic relationship learning interfering with class-agnostic localization.

Method: Proposes balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with learnable class prototypes that equilibrates gradients across classes at each hierarchical level, combined with decoupled learning strategy that separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets for task-specific feature extraction.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with decoupled learning effectively addresses hierarchical label imbalance and localization interference, improving fine-grained object detection performance in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RainFusion2.0 is a hardware-efficient sparse attention mechanism that accelerates DiT models for video/image generation by achieving 80% sparsity with 1.5-1.8x speedup across diverse hardware platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models for video/image generation have extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, limiting practical applications. Existing sparse attention methods have overhead issues and lack hardware generality, being mostly GPU-focused while diverse hardware (ASIC, etc.) are increasingly used.

Method: Proposes RainFusion2.0 with three key techniques: (1) using block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction, (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation, and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically for video generation scenarios.

Result: Achieves 80% sparsity while maintaining video quality, with 1.5-1.8x end-to-end speedup. Demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Conclusion: RainFusion2.0 successfully addresses computational cost and hardware generality limitations of DiT models through an online adaptive, hardware-efficient sparse attention mechanism that works across multiple hardware platforms without compromising quality.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

*Wenzheng Zeng,Difei Gao,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D²VLM: A factorized learning framework that decouples temporal grounding and textual response tasks in video-language models, using evidence tokens and factorized preference optimization for better event-level perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-language models struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. The authors observe that temporal grounding and textual response form a logical hierarchy where accurate temporal evidence grounding should precede reliable textual response, but current approaches handle these tasks in a coupled manner without clear logical structure, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes D²VLM framework with: 1) "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm using evidence tokens for event-level visual semantic capture; 2) Factorized Preference Optimization (FPO) algorithm that explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into optimization objectives; 3) Construction of synthetic dataset for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

Result: Experiments on various tasks demonstrate clear advantages of the approach. The framework shows improved performance in temporal grounding and textual response compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Factorized learning that decouples temporal grounding and textual response tasks, combined with the novel FPO algorithm and evidence token mechanism, provides a more effective approach for video-language understanding with accurate event-level perception.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMR introduces a two-stage "Think-then-Act" approach for text-to-motion generation using latent reasoning to bridge semantic-kinematic mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2M methods treat generation as direct translation, facing a Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch where semantically dense language can't be effectively grounded into kinematically dense motion data in a single shot.

Method: Proposes Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) with a two-stage Think-then-Act process using a Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into Reasoning Latent (for planning) and Execution Latent (for physical fidelity).

Result: LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility when implemented on T2M-GPT and MotionStreamer baselines.

Conclusion: The optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space, validating the need for latent reasoning in text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

TL;DR: Training-free generative adversarial attack framework using diffusion models to create naturalistic adversarial objects that fool monocular depth estimation in autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physical attacks on monocular depth estimation rely on texture-based patches with strict placement constraints and limited realism, reducing effectiveness in complex driving environments. Errors in depth estimation can propagate through downstream decision making and impact traffic safety.

Method: Training-free generative adversarial attack framework with: 1) Salient Region Selection module to identify regions most influential to MDE, and 2) Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by pre-trained diffusion model, enabling diffusion-based conditional generation of naturalistic adversarial objects.

Result: Method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability. Generates physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts, as demonstrated through extensive digital and physical experiments.

Conclusion: The framework enables generation of scene-consistent adversarial objects that are more effective and realistic than existing approaches, with strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in VLMs have limitations: risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity.

Method: Developed GeoBench with four hierarchical reasoning levels (Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, Self-Reflective Backtracking) and six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen to systematically assess capabilities from attribute extraction to logical error correction.

Result: Reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, but performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final accuracy, while Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks.

Conclusion: GeoBench establishes a comprehensive benchmark for geometric problem-solving and offers actionable guidelines for developing geometric reasoning systems, highlighting the importance of hierarchical evaluation and specific reasoning components.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

TL;DR: LLM-based architecture generation for computer vision with systematic prompt engineering (FSAP) and efficient deduplication (Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation), achieving 100x speedup over AST parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated neural network architecture design is challenging due to task diversity and computational constraints. LLMs offer a promising alternative to computationally intensive NAS, but their application to computer vision architecture generation lacks systematic study of prompt engineering and validation strategies.

Method: 1) Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP): systematic study of supporting examples (n=1-6) for LLM-based architecture generation. 2) Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation: lightweight deduplication method (<1ms) for preventing redundant training of duplicate architectures. 3) Dataset-balanced evaluation methodology for comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks.

Result: Found n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Generated 1,900 unique architectures across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365). Deduplication method provides 100x speedup over AST parsing.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establishes rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Motivation: Bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a bottleneck in humanoid robotics, as existing methods struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions into stable, real-time actions.

Method: Two-stage framework integrating fine-tuned MLLM with causal streaming pipeline, unifying inputs through shared discrete codebook via FSQ to ensure cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to physically grounded manifold.

Result: Achieves sub-500ms latency, 19% improvement in zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions, validated on UniMoCap (20-hour humanoid motion benchmark) with robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: UniAct marks a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: D²-Align prevents Preference Mode Collapse in RLHF-aligned diffusion models by directionally correcting reward signals to maintain diversity while achieving high human preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods for text-to-image diffusion models suffer from Preference Mode Collapse (PMC), where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (monolithic styles, overexposure) that degrade generative diversity despite high reward scores.

Method: Proposes Directional Decoupling Alignment (D²-Align): learns a directional correction in the reward model's embedding space while keeping model frozen, then applies this correction to reward signals during optimization to prevent mode collapse.

Result: D²-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference while maintaining diversity, as shown through comprehensive evaluation combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed D²-Align framework effectively mitigates Preference Mode Collapse in RLHF-aligned diffusion models by directionally correcting reward signals, balancing quality and diversity in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

TL;DR: Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD) uses Bayesian inference to create sample-specific target distributions from model predictions, improving accuracy, calibration, and robustness without relying on hard targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard targets in supervised training cause overconfidence, poor calibration, and limited generalization. Existing self-distillation methods still depend on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness.

Method: BSD constructs sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions, eliminating reliance on hard targets after initialization.

Result: BSD consistently improves test accuracy (+1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and reduces Expected Calibration Error (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100). It also enhances robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise.

Conclusion: BSD provides a principled approach to self-distillation that outperforms existing methods in accuracy, calibration, and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance against label noise when combined with contrastive loss.

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

TL;DR: CropTrack is a novel MOT framework for agriculture that combines appearance and motion information to handle occlusions and similar appearances, outperforming motion-only trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural MOT faces challenges from repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Current motion-based trackers struggle with identity preservation during strong occlusions, and appearance integration is difficult due to high object similarity.

Method: CropTrack integrates appearance and motion information with three key components: reranking-enhanced appearance association, one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank.

Result: CropTrack outperforms traditional motion-based methods on agricultural MOT datasets, achieving significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with fewer identity switches.

Conclusion: Combining appearance and motion information in CropTrack effectively addresses agricultural MOT challenges, providing better identity preservation than motion-only approaches.

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) is a memory-efficient framework for hyperspectral image segmentation that learns global clustering from local patches without pre-training, enabling fast training on consumer hardware but suffering from optimization instability due to loss balancing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging analysis faces computational bottlenecks from massive data volumes exceeding memory, and existing foundation models pre-trained on remote sensing data fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures and spatial scales differ fundamentally.

Method: DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, learning global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. The framework maintains constant memory usage and can train in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware.

Result: On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation with mean IoU of 0.925 and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability where meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space.

Conclusion: The DGC design philosophy has merit as intellectual scaffolding for memory-efficient HSI segmentation, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing to address the optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

*Xunyi Zhao,Gengze Zhou,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs show poor context awareness and spatial reasoning in embodied navigation despite following instructions, with CoT and self-reflection actually decreasing performance in VLN tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate MLLMs' potential as embodied agents for vision-language navigation, which requires multi-round dialogue, spatial reasoning, and sequential action prediction - capabilities that need further exploration beyond standard vision-language tasks.

Method: Introduces VLN-MME, a unified evaluation framework that bridges traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark for probing MLLMs as zero-shot agents. Uses modular design for structured comparisons and component-level ablations across MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks.

Result: Enhancing baseline agents with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and self-reflection leads to unexpected performance decrease, revealing that MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks. While they can follow instructions and structure output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low.

Conclusion: VLN-MME establishes groundwork for systematic evaluation of MLLMs in embodied navigation and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities, offering crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Internal Guidance (IG) improves diffusion model training by adding auxiliary supervision on intermediate layers and extrapolating outputs, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores without complex degradation strategies or extra sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models struggle with low-probability areas due to insufficient training data coverage, while existing guidance methods like CFG cause oversimplified/distorted samples or require complex degradation strategies, extra training, and additional sampling steps.

Method: Proposes Internal Guidance (IG) which adds auxiliary supervision on intermediate layers during training, then extrapolates intermediate and deep layer outputs during sampling to guide generation toward high-probability areas.

Result: Significant improvements in training efficiency and generation quality across baselines: SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 (80 epochs) and 1.75 (800 epochs) on ImageNet 256x256; LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34, and combined with CFG reaches state-of-the-art FID=1.19.

Conclusion: Internal Guidance provides a simple yet effective alternative to complex guidance strategies, enabling diffusion models to better capture data distributions and achieve superior generation quality with improved training efficiency.

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: DarkEQA is a new benchmark for evaluating Vision Language Models (VLMs) on embodied question answering tasks under realistic low-light conditions, revealing significant performance limitations of current models in dark environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM benchmarks focus on ideal lighting conditions, but real-world embodied agents need to operate 24/7 in various lighting conditions including low-light/night environments, which has been largely overlooked in current evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created DarkEQA benchmark with physics-based low-light degradation modeling in linear RAW space, simulating realistic illumination drop and sensor noise followed by ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. Evaluates question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations to isolate perception bottlenecks.

Result: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement models reveals significant limitations of current VLMs when operating under challenging low-light conditions.

Conclusion: DarkEQA addresses a critical gap in VLM evaluation for embodied AI, providing a physically realistic benchmark for assessing robustness in low-light conditions, with findings showing current models are inadequate for reliable 24/7 operation in dark environments.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

### [46] [PointRAFT: 3D deep learning for high-throughput prediction of potato tuber weight from partial point clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24193)
*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointRAFT is a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts potato tuber weight from partial 3D point clouds, overcoming self-occlusion issues in harvester-based yield estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current potato yield estimation using RGB-D cameras on harvesters suffers from systematic underestimation due to incomplete point clouds caused by self-occlusion of tubers on conveyor belts.

Method: PointRAFT directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties (like tuber weight) from partial point clouds without full 3D reconstruction, using an object height embedding as a key architectural innovation to incorporate tuber height as additional geometric cue.

Result: Achieved MAE of 12.0g and RMSE of 17.2g on test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, outperforming linear regression and PointNet++ baselines, with 6.3ms inference time enabling 150 tubers/second processing.

Conclusion: PointRAFT provides accurate, high-throughput potato weight estimation suitable for commercial harvesters and offers a versatile regression framework for broader 3D phenotyping and robotic perception applications.

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot is a video diffusion model that independently controls camera viewpoint and motion sequence for continuous space-time exploration of dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack explicit disentangled control over spatial (camera viewpoint) and temporal (motion sequence) dimensions, limiting creative exploration of dynamic scenes across both space and time.

Method: Introduces animation time-embedding for motion control, temporal-warping training scheme using multi-view datasets, improved camera-conditioning, and CamxTime synthetic dataset with full space-time trajectories.

Result: Demonstrates clear space-time disentanglement on real-world and synthetic data, achieving strong results compared to prior work with precise independent control over camera viewpoint and motion sequence.

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot successfully achieves robust space-time disentanglement for controllable generative rendering, enabling continuous exploration of dynamic scenes across both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorGi is a training-free inference acceleration framework for Diffusion Transformers that reduces redundant computation by caching and reusing low-contribution transformer blocks across denoising steps, achieving up to 2.0x speedup while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have high inference costs due to iterative denoising processes and large model capacity, with substantial redundant computation across steps that needs to be reduced.

Method: CorGi uses contribution-guided block-wise interval caching to selectively reuse outputs of low-contribution transformer blocks across denoising steps. CorGi+ extends this for text-to-image tasks by leveraging cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applying partial attention updates to protect object details.

Result: Evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average while preserving high generation quality.

Conclusion: CorGi provides an effective training-free approach to accelerate DiT inference by reducing redundant computation through selective block caching and reuse, with CorGi+ offering enhanced text-to-image performance through attention-aware optimizations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

TL;DR: DualityForge is a framework that uses diffusion-based video editing to create counterfactual videos and QA pairs to reduce hallucinations in multimodal LLMs, achieving 24% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual ungrounded hallucinations due to over-reliance on language priors, especially with counterfactual videos. This is hard to fix due to the high cost of collecting counterfactual data.

Method: DualityForge uses controllable diffusion-based video editing to transform real videos into counterfactual scenarios, automatically generating QA pairs. Also introduces Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train) with two-stage SFT-RL training.

Result: 24.0% relative improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline on counterfactual videos, with significant gains on both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces MLLM hallucinations on counterfactual videos through synthetic data generation and contrastive training, with promising generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical challenge of imbalanced medical image data, especially during pandemics where COVID-19 datasets have severe class imbalance, hindering accurate AI-based diagnosis.

Method: Uses progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data, combines synthetic and real data with weighted approach, and employs multi-objective meta-heuristic optimization for classifier hyper-parameter tuning.

Result: Achieves 95.5% accuracy for 4-class and 98.5% accuracy for 2-class imbalanced COVID-19 chest X-ray classification, outperforming existing methods with superior cross-validated metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses medical image classification challenges with imbalanced data during pandemics, demonstrating practical utility for COVID-19 diagnosis through synthetic data generation and optimization techniques.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, creating data scarcity that limits both AI model development and training opportunities for novice clinicians.

Method: Uses language-guided concept disentanglement to separate pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding lesion features into a learnable prototype embedding while varying non-diagnostic attributes for diversity. Validated on four rare pathologies.

Result: Synthetic images were clinically plausible, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers (improved true positive rate at low false-positive rates), and in a blinded reader study, novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare cases achieved 0.400 increase in recall and 0.267 increase in precision.

Conclusion: EndoRare establishes a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education through one-shot generative synthesis.

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM is a lightweight learnable module that refines CLIP's internal features for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, enabling "train once, use anywhere" capability with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free OVSS methods have limitations: they either rely on expensive external models (SAM, DINO) or use static heuristics on CLIP features, leading to computational cost or suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Attention Refinement Module (ARM) with semantically-guided cross-attention (using deep features to refine shallow features) and self-attention blocks. Trained once on general datasets like COCO-Stuff, then used as plug-and-play post-processor for various training-free frameworks.

Result: ARM consistently improves baseline performance across multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Conclusion: ARM provides an effective, efficient solution for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by unlocking CLIP's internal potential through adaptive feature fusion, enabling "train once, use anywhere" deployment.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage is a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and temporally coherent asset editing in driving scenes, using 2D encoder latents to restore detail and a two-stage alignment strategy to fix distribution mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-centric autonomous driving needs diverse training data, but existing video object editing methods struggle with maintaining both visual fidelity and temporal coherence for effective data augmentation.

Method: Builds on text-to-video diffusion prior for temporal consistency. Uses temporally agnostic latents from pretrained 2D encoder injected into 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causality. Introduces two-stage data alignment combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement to address distribution mismatch between scene objects and inserted assets.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Conclusion: Mirage provides an effective solution for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes, addressing key challenges in video object editing for autonomous driving data augmentation.

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Motivation: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT lung cancer screening, and its differential impact on generalist vs specialist models is unknown.

Method: Developed Virtual-Eyes pipeline that enforces 512x512 resolution, rejects non-diagnostic series, extracts contiguous lung blocks using Hounsfield-unit filtering and lung-coverage scoring while preserving 16-bit data. Tested on 765 NLST patients using RAD-DINO, Merlin, Sybil, and ResNet-18 models with frozen encoders.

Result: Virtual-Eyes improved RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling). However, Sybil and ResNet-18 degraded under Virtual-Eyes, and Merlin showed limited transferability regardless of preprocessing.

Conclusion: Anatomically targeted quality control can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context, highlighting the importance of preprocessing strategy selection based on model type.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

*Rahul Medicharla,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotivNet is a generalizable facial emotion recognition model using Meta's Sapiens backbone that achieves competitive cross-domain performance without cross-domain training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FER models have weak generalization on diverse real-world data, requiring cross-domain training which is impractical for real applications. There's a need for models that generalize well without such training.

Method: Uses Meta's Sapiens (human vision foundational model) as backbone, proposes MotivNet as downstream task, defines three evaluation criteria: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity.

Result: MotivNet achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training, meets all three evaluation criteria, and validates MotivNet as a viable Sapiens downstream task.

Conclusion: MotivNet demonstrates strong generalization across domains using Sapiens backbone, making FER more practical for real-world applications without requiring cross-domain training.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

*Wen-wai Yim,Yujuan Fu,Asma Ben Abacha,Meliha Yetisgen,Noel Codella,Roberto Andres Novoa,Josep Malvehy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DermaVQA-DAS extends dermatological image analysis with patient-centered QA and segmentation tasks using expert-developed DAS framework, benchmarking multimodal models with strong QA performance (up to 0.798 accuracy) and segmentation results (0.566 Dice score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dermatological datasets focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting applicability to patient-centered care. There's a need for benchmarks that incorporate patient perspectives and clinical assessment frameworks.

Method: Introduces DermaVQA-DAS dataset with two tasks: closed-ended QA and lesion segmentation. Develops Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) - expert-developed framework with 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions in English/Chinese. Benchmarks state-of-the-art multimodal models with various prompting strategies for segmentation.

Result: For segmentation: Default prompt works best under Mean-of-Max/Mean-of-Mean evaluation, while augmented prompt (patient query title+content) achieves highest performance under majority-vote microscore (Jaccard 0.395, Dice 0.566 with BiomedParse). For QA: Strong overall performance with accuracies 0.729-0.798; o3 best (0.798), GPT-4.1 close (0.796), Gemini-1.5-Pro competitive (0.783).

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS addresses patient-centered care gap by providing structured clinical assessment framework and benchmarks. Dataset, DAS schema, and evaluation protocols publicly released to accelerate research in dermatological vision-language modeling for patient-centered applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

*Fuqiang Gu,Yuanke Li,Xianlei Long,Kangping Ji,Chao Chen,Qingyi Gu,Zhenliang Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaSeg: A dual-branch semantic segmentation framework using parallel Mamba encoders for RGB and event data fusion, with novel Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module for spatial and temporal alignment, achieving SOTA performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based semantic segmentation degrades under challenging conditions (fast motion, low-light, HDR) due to frame camera limitations. Event cameras offer complementary advantages (high temporal resolution, low latency) but lack color/texture. Existing multimodal fusion approaches are computationally expensive and neglect temporal dynamics of event streams.

Method: Proposes MambaSeg with parallel Mamba encoders for RGB images and event streams. Introduces Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM) containing Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM) for fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions to reduce cross-modal ambiguity and improve alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MambaSeg shows promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception by effectively leveraging complementary properties of RGB and event modalities through efficient spatial and temporal fusion.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

*Zhi Li,Yaqi Wang,Bingtao Ma,Yifan Zhang,Huiyu Zhou,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGMP framework uses physics-based simulation and deterministic manifold projection for fast, reliable metal artifact reduction in dental CBCT, eliminating slow diffusion sampling while maintaining anatomical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in dental CBCT obscure anatomy and hinder diagnosis. Current deep learning methods have limitations: supervised methods cause spectral blurring from "regression-to-the-mean", unsupervised methods risk structural hallucinations, and diffusion models are too slow for clinical use due to iterative stochastic sampling.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs using Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins. 2) DMP-Former adapts Direct x-Prediction paradigm for deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in single forward pass. 3) Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module uses medical foundation model priors (MedDINOv3) to ensure clinical plausibility.

Result: PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets, particularly on unseen anatomy. It sets new benchmarks in efficiency (single forward pass vs. iterative sampling) and diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: The PGMP framework successfully addresses key limitations in metal artifact reduction by combining physics-based simulation with deterministic manifold projection, enabling fast, clinically-viable artifact removal while maintaining anatomical accuracy through medical foundation model guidance.

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

*Devendra K. Jangid,Ripon K. Saha,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Jing Li,Seok-Jun Lee,Hamid R. Sheikh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model using DINOv2 features for smartphone SISR to provide stricter, hallucination-free conditioning compared to text-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone cameras need SISR with minimal hallucinations for high-fidelity LR images, but current Text-2-Image Diffusion models use text features that are too high-level and can't accurately describe small patches, leading to undesirable artifacts.

Method: Introduces a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model that uses DINOv2 features for conditioning instead of text features, providing lower-level, richer descriptors for small patches with stricter conditioning.

Result: Not specified in the abstract, but the proposed method addresses limitations of text-based conditioning for smartphone SISR applications.

Conclusion: Lower-level feature conditioning using DINOv2 provides stricter and richer conditioning for SISR on smartphone images, enabling hallucination-free super-resolution for consumer photography applications.

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D lifting approach for panoramic stitching that converts images to point clouds for global fusion, then projects to cylindrical panorama, reducing distortions in complex scenes with parallax and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D homography and mesh warping methods fail in real 3D scenes with multiple depth layers and occlusions, causing ghosting, bending, and stretching distortions, especially in multi-view and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios.

Method: Lifts each input image to dense 3D point representations in unified coordinate system, performs global cross-view fusion with confidence metrics, establishes unified projection center, uses equidistant cylindrical projection to map fused data to panoramic manifold, and fills holes in canvas domain.

Result: Substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios with significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding more natural and consistent panoramic results compared to traditional 2D methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully re-conceptualizes stitching from 2D warping to 3D consistency paradigm, offering flexible incorporation of various 3D lifting and completion modules for improved panoramic quality in complex real-world scenes.

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: RGTN is a physics-inspired tensor network structure search framework using renormalization group flows for multi-scale continuous structure evolution, achieving superior compression and 4-600× speedup over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor network structure search methods have limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness. They struggle with single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing inefficiency.

Method: RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation with renormalization group flows for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. It employs learnable edge gates for topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension (measuring local stress) and edge information flow (quantifying connectivity importance). The method starts from low-complexity coarse scales and refines to finer ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600× faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: RGTN validates the effectiveness of physics-inspired approaches for tensor network structure search, overcoming key challenges in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness through multi-scale renormalization group guidance.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

*Kai Ye,Xiaotong You,Jianghang Lin,Jiayi Ji,Pingyang Dai,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3 is a zero-shot reasoning segmentation framework that uses evolutionary search at inference time to iteratively refine prompt hypotheses through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop, outperforming both static baselines and supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning segmentation methods have significant limitations: SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, RL has training instability and rigid reward functions, while training-free methods are limited by static single-pass inference that lacks reasoning depth and self-correction capabilities.

Method: EVOL-SAM3 reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. It maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop with Visual Arena for fitness assessment via pairwise tournaments, Semantic Mutation for diversity injection, and Heterogeneous Arena for robust final selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show EVOL-SAM3 substantially outperforms static baselines and significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3 demonstrates that evolutionary search at inference time can effectively address limitations of current reasoning segmentation approaches, achieving superior performance without training while enabling deeper reasoning and self-correction capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CERES is a causal framework that improves egocentric referring video object segmentation by addressing dataset biases and visual confounding factors through dual-modal causal intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Ego-RVOS methods struggle due to ambiguities in egocentric videos and biases in training data, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings and being affected by egocentric visual confounding factors like rapid motion and occlusions.

Method: CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: 1) backdoor adjustment to counteract language representation biases from dataset statistics, and 2) front-door adjustment to address visual confounding by integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles.

Result: CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for egocentric video understanding.

Conclusion: The CERES framework shows the potential of causal reasoning for creating more robust models in egocentric video understanding by addressing both language biases and visual confounding factors inherent in first-person perspectives.

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

TL;DR: SenseNova-MARS is a multimodal agentic reasoning framework that uses RL to enable VLMs to dynamically interleave visual reasoning with tool manipulation (search, cropping) for complex visual understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited to text-oriented reasoning or isolated tool use, lacking the ability to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning in knowledge-intensive, visually complex scenarios that require coordinated external tools.

Method: Introduces SenseNova-MARS framework with reinforcement learning (BN-GSPO algorithm) to enable VLMs to dynamically integrate image search, text search, and image crop tools for fine-grained visual understanding.

Result: Achieves SOTA on search benchmarks: 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch (their new benchmark), surpassing proprietary models like Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5.

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities, with code/models/datasets to be released for further research.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive enhances Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving by incorporating LiDAR point clouds for 3D spatial understanding, using gradual feature fusion to maintain VLM knowledge while improving metric reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for autonomous driving rely on 2D images, which lack accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, creating safety and reliability bottlenecks for driving decisions.

Method: Proposes LVLDrive framework that adds LiDAR point clouds as extra input modality, uses Gradual Fusion Q-Former to incrementally inject LiDAR features without disrupting pre-trained VLM knowledge, and trains with spatial-aware QA dataset for 3D perception.

Result: LVLDrive outperforms vision-only VLMs on driving benchmarks across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and driving decision-making, demonstrating superior 3D reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D metric data (LiDAR) is essential for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems, and gradual fusion approach successfully integrates 3D perception while preserving existing language model knowledge.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

### [67] [The Mechanics of CNN Filtering with Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24338)
*Liam Frija-Altrac,Matthew Toews*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding convolutional filtering with rectification, drawing analogies to special relativity and quantum mechanics by analyzing even/odd kernel components as potential/kinetic energy and relating information displacement speed to odd/total kernel energy ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical link between information processing in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fundamental physical principles from special relativity and quantum mechanics, specifically the energy-momentum relation.

Method: Decompose convolutional kernels into orthogonal even and odd components, analyze their effects on image content (even: isotropic diffusion preserving center of mass; odd: directional displacement of center of mass), and study these properties in the spectral domain using discrete cosine transform (DCT) to examine low-frequency basis components (DC Σ and gradient ∇).

Result: Even kernels behave analogously to rest/potential energy (zero net momentum), odd kernels behave like kinetic energy (non-zero momentum), and the speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Small convolutional filters (3×3) are dominated by low-frequency DCT bases that define fundamental information propagation modes.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the first link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation from modern relativistic physics, establishing elementary information mechanics as a novel framework for understanding convolutional filtering mechanics.

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

*Siyuan Hu,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowUI-π is a flow-based generative model for GUI agents that enables both discrete clicks and continuous drag actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on drag manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents only support discrete click predictions (x,y coordinates), which prevents them from performing free-form, closed-loop trajectories like dragging progress bars that require continuous perception and adjustment. This limitation hinders achieving human-like dexterous manipulation in digital environments.

Method: Developed ShowUI-π with three key designs: 1) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions that integrate both click and drag actions in a shared model, 2) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling that predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, and 3) Created Drag Training data and Benchmark (ScreenDrag) with 20K manually collected drag trajectories across five domains and comprehensive evaluation protocols.

Result: ShowUI-π achieves 26.98 score on ScreenDrag benchmark with only 450M parameters, outperforming proprietary GUI agents like Operator (13.27) and Gemini-2.5-CUA (22.18). The benchmark reveals current GUI agents struggle with drag tasks, highlighting both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: ShowUI-π advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital environments by enabling continuous drag manipulation alongside discrete clicks. The work provides a new benchmark and demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, paving the way for more capable GUI automation systems.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Compression techniques (quantization, pruning, clustering) can preserve or even improve model robustness to natural corruption, with optimal results from customized combinations on complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed deep learning models are needed for resource-constrained devices, but compression may affect robustness to natural corruption, requiring comprehensive evaluation of robustness-accuracy-compression trade-offs.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of quantization, pruning, and weight clustering (individually and combined) on ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2 using CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C datasets with multiobjective assessment.

Result: Certain compression strategies preserve or improve robustness, especially on complex architectures; customized technique combinations yield beneficial multi-objective results for robust deployment.

Conclusion: Compression methods can be selected to achieve robust and efficient model deployment in corrupted real-world environments, with insights provided for optimal configuration selection.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedunCut is a dynamic model size selection system that reduces compute costs by 14-62% for live video analytics while maintaining accuracy, using measurement-driven planning and data-driven performance modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live video analytics (LVA) has high inference costs with modern vision models across massive camera fleets. Existing dynamic model size selection (DMSS) methods fail to generalize to diverse workloads like mobile videos and lower accuracy targets due to inefficient sampling and inaccurate accuracy prediction.

Method: RedunCut uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction for dynamic model size selection.

Result: Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos with multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and drift.

Conclusion: RedunCut effectively addresses the limitations of prior DMSS systems by optimizing sampling efficiency and improving accuracy prediction, enabling significant compute cost reductions for live video analytics without model retraining.

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows causing significant delays, preventing immediate non-verbal feedback needed for realistic listener responses in dyadic conversations.

Method: Flow matching-based autoregressive framework with two key designs: (1) stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, (2) causal encoder enhanced by lookahead module to incorporate short future context (60ms) while maintaining low latency.

Result: Generates video within 34ms per frame, keeping total system latency under 100ms. Achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality with offline/online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF dataset.

Conclusion: DyStream enables real-time dyadic talking head video generation with ultra-low latency, significantly outperforming alternative causal strategies while maintaining high quality, making realistic listener feedback possible.

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

TL;DR: AI-driven framework automates surgical skill assessment using video transformers and motion analysis to provide objective feedback for microanastomosis training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional surgical proficiency assessment methods are subjective, time-consuming, and require expert supervision, making them impractical for scalable training programs, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Video transformer architecture (TimeSformer) enhanced with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention for action recognition, combined with YOLO-based object detection and tracking for fine-grained motion analysis of instrument kinematics.

Result: Achieved 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation (increased to 93.62% with post-processing) and 76% average classification accuracy in replicating expert assessments across five skill aspects using 58 expert-annotated videos.

Conclusion: The AI system provides objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback for surgical skill assessment, enabling more standardized and data-driven training in surgical education.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

TL;DR: ViT encoder representations show compositional properties when using wavelet transform primitives, similar to language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Vision Transformers structure visual information by investigating whether they learn compositional representations, analogous to how language models process text.

Method: Use Discrete Wavelet Transform to obtain input-dependent visual primitives, then test if composed representations from these primitives can reproduce original image representations in ViT encoder latent space.

Result: Primitives from one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, revealing compositional structure in ViT representations.

Conclusion: ViTs learn compositional representations similar to language models, with wavelet transform providing effective visual primitives for analyzing this compositionality.

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery is challenging for space missions due to limited bandwidth, requiring preservation of fine spectral and spatial details while maintaining compression efficiency.

Method: Two complementary modules: 1) Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE) models inter-band relationships using graph nodes for spectral channels with learned edge features; 2) Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C) combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures.

Result: On SDOML dataset across six EUV channels: 20.15% reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Conclusion: The proposed learned compression framework effectively balances bandwidth constraints with preservation of spectral and spatial details in solar observations, outperforming existing learned baselines in both spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in medical imaging only provide structured predictions, requiring radiologists to manually convert these into narrative reports. There's a need to bridge this gap by automatically generating full diagnostic narratives from AI findings.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-rays, followed by GPT-4 to generate natural-language reports from the structured detection outputs (bounding boxes and class labels).

Result: Strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 comparison showed differences in detection accuracy and inference latency. GPT-4 excelled in clarity (4.88/5) but scored lower for natural writing flow (2.81/5).

Conclusion: The system achieves clinical accuracy in report generation but remains stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text, indicating current AI can produce accurate content but lacks the natural writing style of human experts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs (H.264/HEVC) lack native support for ML-centric latent representations, limiting integration into deep learning pipelines despite growing video traffic demands on bandwidth and storage.

Method: Extends VQ-VAE-2 to spatiotemporal setting with two-level hierarchical latent structure using 3D residual convolutions, incorporates perceptual loss from pre-trained VGG16, optimized for 64x64 video clips with ~18.5M parameters.

Result: Achieves 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM on UCF101 test set (2-second clips, 32 frames at 16 FPS), improving over single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM.

Conclusion: The lightweight framework is suitable for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios like real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN storage optimization.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Motivation: Current text-to-video generation methods struggle to produce physically consistent videos that follow natural laws, lacking both training data with rich physics interactions and explicit physical reasoning capabilities.

Method: 1) PhyAugPipe: Uses VLM with chain-of-thought reasoning to create PhyVidGen-135K dataset; 2) PhyGDPO: Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization with Physics-Guided Rewarding scheme and LoRA-Switch Reference for efficient training.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on physics evaluation benchmarks PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware framework effectively improves physical consistency in video generation through data construction, groupwise preference optimization, and physics-guided rewarding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VG benchmarks are limited to clean environments (like COCO) and fail to capture real-world complexities (illumination, weather changes) needed for evaluating model robustness in safety-critical applications.

Method: Created RGBT-Ground benchmark with aligned RGB-Thermal image pairs, high-quality referring expressions, bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations. Proposed RGBT-VGNet, a unified framework supporting uni-modal (RGB/TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) inputs with effective fusion of complementary visual modalities.

Result: RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms adapted existing methods, particularly excelling in challenging nighttime and long-distance scenarios.

Conclusion: RGBT-Ground enables comprehensive evaluation of robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments, and RGBT-VGNet provides an effective baseline for multi-modal fusion, with all resources to be publicly released.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARFT improves CDVQA by addressing decision ambiguity through reinforcement fine-tuning that targets samples with small probability margins between correct answers and strong distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CDVQA models fail not just from clearly wrong predictions but from decision ambiguity where models assign similar confidence to correct answers and strong distractors, limiting discriminability and robustness.

Method: DARFT: Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning that mines Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) using an SFT-trained reference policy, then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset using multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings, demonstrating improved discriminability and robustness.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing decision-ambiguous samples is crucial for CDVQA performance, and DARFT effectively addresses this challenge without additional supervision by sharpening decision boundaries and suppressing strong distractors.

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: SliceLens: A hypothesis-driven framework using LLMs/VLMs for fine-grained error slice discovery in multi-instance vision tasks, with new FeSD benchmark showing SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slice discovery methods are limited to image classification and struggle with multi-instance tasks (detection, segmentation, pose estimation). Current benchmarks are algorithm-specific, classification-biased, and use artificial ground truth that doesn't reflect real model failures.

Method: SliceLens leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling identification of fine-grained, interpretable error slices.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on the new FeSD benchmark. Identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements validated through model repair experiments.

Conclusion: SliceLens addresses limitations of existing slice discovery methods by enabling fine-grained error analysis for multi-instance vision tasks through LLM/VLM-powered hypothesis generation and verification, with strong empirical validation on new benchmark.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

TL;DR: Researchers created a 3D disaster dataset from Hurricane Ian UAV footage and found SOTA 3D segmentation models perform poorly on post-disaster scenes, highlighting need for specialized datasets and improved methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause severe human and economic losses, but existing 3D semantic segmentation models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments, limiting effective assessment and response.

Method: Constructed specialized 3D dataset using UAV-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022), employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds, then evaluated SOTA models (FPT, PTv3, OA-CNNs).

Conclusion: Urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

*Zheng Liu,Jinchao Zhu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoRA is a novel collaborative low-rank adaptation method that balances fine-tuning performance and parameter efficiency for vision transformers through base-space sharing and diversity enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods either sacrifice performance for parameter efficiency or introduce excessive parameters, failing to balance learning performance and parameter efficiency in vision transformer fine-tuning.

Method: CLoRA uses base-space sharing where all low-rank modules share projection spaces, and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) to regularize similarities among representations to encourage diversity.

Result: CLoRA achieves better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency than state-of-the-art methods, requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis.

Conclusion: CLoRA effectively addresses the trade-off between performance and parameter efficiency in vision transformer fine-tuning through collaborative low-rank adaptation with diversity enhancement.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Introduces 3D visual grounding for outdoor monitoring scenarios with a new dataset (MoniRefer) and method (Moni3DVG) for roadside infrastructure systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding focuses on indoor/outdoor driving scenes, but roadside monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to lack of paired point cloud-text data from infrastructure sensors.

Method: Proposes Moni3DVG, an end-to-end method that leverages appearance information from images and geometry/optical information from point clouds for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization.

Result: Created MoniRefer dataset with ~136,018 objects and 411,128 natural language expressions from real-world traffic intersections. Experiments show superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel task for infrastructure-level traffic scene understanding, provides first large-scale dataset for roadside 3D visual grounding, and demonstrates effective multi-modal approach.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

TL;DR: Proposes Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network for robust feature point matching with outlier handling, using stage fusion and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature point matching is fundamental but suffers from outlier sensitivity, especially with high outlier proportions, affecting accuracy and robustness. Need to extract high-quality information while reducing negative sample errors.

Method: Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network with: 1) Layer-by-layer channel fusion module preserving feature semantics from each stage, 2) Hierarchical attention module adaptively capturing global perception and structural semantics, 3) Two architectures for feature extraction and integration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets for both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed network effectively addresses outlier issues in feature point matching through hierarchical attention and fusion mechanisms, improving matching precision and robustness.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

TL;DR: FRS-YOLO: Improved YOLO model for fire rescue object detection with new FireRescue dataset covering urban/mountain/forest/water scenes and 8 key categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fire detection research focuses on natural environments (mountains/forests) but neglects complex urban rescue scenes, and existing systems have limited class coverage (only flames/smoke) missing crucial command targets like fire trucks and firefighters.

Method: 1) Created FireRescue dataset with 15,980 images, 32,000 bounding boxes covering urban/mountain/forest/water scenes and 8 key categories. 2) Proposed FRS-YOLO with plug-and-play multidimensional collaborative enhancement attention module for inter-class discrimination and dynamic feature sampler to enhance foreground features against smoke/background interference.

Result: Experimental results show fire rescue object detection is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves YOLO series models' detection performance in this context.

Conclusion: The FireRescue dataset and FRS-YOLO model address limitations in current fire detection research by covering diverse rescue scenarios and key command targets, with improved performance for challenging fire rescue object detection tasks.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

*Siyang Wang,Hanting Li,Wei Li,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadAR accelerates autoregressive visual generation using radial topology and parallel ring-wise prediction with nested attention for error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models in visual generation suffer from low inference efficiency due to sequential token-by-token decoding, despite their representational capacity. Visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations not fully exploited by standard raster-scan decoding orders.

Method: Organizes generation around radial topology: selects initial token as center, groups other tokens into concentric rings by spatial distance, and generates ring-wise from inner to outer regions for parallel prediction. Introduces nested attention mechanism to dynamically refine implausible outputs during forward pass to mitigate error accumulation.

Result: Significantly improves generation efficiency while preserving structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes. Enables parallel prediction of tokens within same ring, substantially increasing parallelization compared to traditional sequential decoding.

Conclusion: RadAR provides an efficient and parallelizable framework that accelerates autoregressive visual generation by exploiting spatial correlations through radial topology and addressing prediction inconsistencies with nested attention, maintaining representational capacity while dramatically improving inference speed.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowBlending is a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy for diffusion models that uses large models at capacity-sensitive stages and small models at intermediate stages, achieving up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that model capacity impact varies across timesteps in diffusion models - crucial for early and late stages but negligible during intermediate stages. This insight motivates a more efficient sampling strategy that doesn't require full large model capacity throughout the entire generation process.

Method: FlowBlending uses a large model and a small model together: large model handles capacity-sensitive early and late stages, while small model handles intermediate stages. The method includes criteria to choose stage boundaries and uses velocity-divergence analysis to identify capacity-sensitive regions.

Result: Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B) models, FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs while maintaining visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment comparable to large models. It's also compatible with existing acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Conclusion: FlowBlending demonstrates that strategic allocation of model capacity across different generation stages can significantly improve inference efficiency without sacrificing quality, offering a practical approach to accelerate large diffusion models while maintaining their performance characteristics.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-text-to-audio (VT2A) models suffer from visual dominance over text conditioning, lack fine-grained controllability definitions, and weak instruction following due to brief categorical tags in datasets.

Method: Introduces EchoFoley task with symbolic representation for sounding events (when, what, how), constructs EchoFoley-6k dataset with 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets, and proposes EchoVidia framework with slow-fast thinking strategy.

Result: EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The EchoFoley framework successfully addresses key limitations in video-grounded sound generation, enabling fine-grained control through symbolic event representation and improved instruction following.

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

TL;DR: Unified framework for 3D instance segmentation that merges feature learning and label decoding into single optimization, with boundary-aware hard mining for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from inconsistent 2D labels across views, requiring two-stage approaches with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering or preprocessing. These limitations lead to poor 3D predictions and increased training time.

Method: Proposes unified framework with learnable feature embeddings in Gaussian primitives, decoded via novel "Embedding-to-Label" process. Addresses boundary artifacts with hard-mining on object boundaries, stabilized by applying linear layer to rasterized embeddings before triplet loss calculation.

Result: Outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets, with reduced training time and improved performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively integrates feature learning and label decoding, while boundary-aware hard mining with stabilization addresses artifact issues, resulting in superior 3D instance segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

### [94] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise2Noise training for denoisers works with noisy pairs but fails with nonlinear preprocessing. The paper identifies specific nonlinear functions that minimize bias, enabling tone mapping for HDR image denoising without clean reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise training eliminates the need for clean target images but fails when nonlinear functions are applied to noisy targets, limiting preprocessing options. This is problematic for HDR image denoising where tone mapping is needed to handle outliers.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze nonlinear function effects on noisy targets. Identified a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias when combined with specific loss functions. Applied this to HDR image denoising by using tone mapping functions that reduce dynamic range without introducing significant bias.

Result: The method enables Noise2Noise training with tone mapping for HDR images. Applied to a Monte Carlo renderer denoiser, results approach those of the original implementation trained with high-sample reference images, using only noisy training data.

Conclusion: Certain nonlinear functions can be safely used with Noise2Noise training without significant bias, enabling preprocessing like tone mapping for HDR denoising. This expands Noise2Noise's applicability to challenging domains like Monte Carlo rendering.

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OFL-SAM2 is a prompt-free adaptation of SAM2 for medical image segmentation that uses a lightweight mapping network trained with limited annotated data to generate target features, eliminating the need for manual prompts and achieving SOTA performance with label-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 shows promise for medical image segmentation but requires extensive annotated data and manual prompts, which are labor-intensive and need medical expert intervention. The authors aim to create a label-efficient, prompt-free adaptation for medical applications.

Method: Introduces OFL-SAM2 with two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains a lightweight mapping network using limited annotated data to generate target features, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates these target features with SAM2's frozen memory-attention features. The mapping network supports online parameter updates during inference for better generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three diverse medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2 successfully addresses the challenges of adapting SAM2 to medical image segmentation by eliminating the need for manual prompts and extensive annotations, providing a label-efficient solution that maintains high performance through online few-shot learning and adaptive feature fusion.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity of real-world financial reasoning, which requires understanding implicit scenarios, processing lengthy financial documents, and performing multi-step computations with cross-page evidence.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporating 12 types of implicit financial scenarios, 837 Chinese/English documents across 9 document types averaging 50.8 pages, and problems requiring 11-step reasoning on average with cross-page evidence.

Result: The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different RAG methods show significant performance variations, demonstrating the benchmark's challenging nature.

Conclusion: FinMMDocR is expected to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods for complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world financial scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object detectors trained on standard autonomous driving benchmarks struggle to generalize across different geographic domains (e.g., U.S. vs. Asia/Europe), creating a need for efficient domain adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes lidar domain adaptation based on neuron activation patterns that selects a small, representative, and diverse subset of target domain samples for annotation, combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning to prevent weight drift.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the proposed approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques while requiring very small annotation budget.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation for 3D object detectors can be achieved with minimal target domain annotations through strategic sample selection based on neuron activation patterns and weight drift prevention techniques.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: CPJ provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning for robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning, advancing interpretable crop disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDM is a diffusion model that removes motion artifacts from non-gated chest CT scans to improve coronary artery calcium scoring accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAC scoring from chest CT is important for cardiovascular risk assessment but is limited by motion artifacts in non-gated CTs, which are more accessible than ECG-gated cardiac CTs but suffer from more severe motion issues.

Method: ProDM uses three key components: 1) CAC motion simulation data engine to synthesize realistic non-gated CTs from cardiac-gated CTs, 2) property-aware learning with calcium-specific priors and differentiable calcium consistency loss, and 3) progressive correction scheme across diffusion steps.

Result: ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared to baselines, and a reader study confirms it suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability.

Conclusion: ProDM demonstrates the potential of progressive, property-aware generative frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging without requiring ECG-gating.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

TL;DR: VIPER benchmark introduces process-aware evaluation for video reasoning models, revealing only 20% process-outcome consistency and significant outcome-hacking in current SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reasoning evaluation relies on single-frame assessments, leading to outcome-hacking where models reach correct conclusions through erroneous processes. Need for process-aware evaluation to assess reasoning validity.

Method: Propose VIPER benchmark with 16 tasks across 6 reasoning domains (temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, planning). Introduce Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r) metric using VLM-as-Judge with hierarchical rubric to evaluate intermediate steps and final results.

Result: State-of-the-art video models achieve only ~20% POC@1.0, showing significant outcome-hacking. Test-time scaling and sampling robustness experiments reveal substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Current video generation models lack true reasoning capabilities despite correct final answers. VIPER benchmark enables process-aware evaluation, highlighting need for improved reasoning in video generation models.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Bi-C2R framework for Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-ID (RFL-ReID) that enables continuous model updates without re-indexing historical gallery features, addressing privacy and cost concerns while maintaining feature compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lifelong ReID methods require costly re-indexing of historical gallery images after each model update, which raises privacy concerns and computational costs. This creates incompatible features between old and new models, degrading performance.

Method: Bi-C2R (Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation) framework continuously updates gallery features extracted by old models to maintain compatibility with new model features without re-indexing historical data.

Result: The method achieves leading performance on both the new RFL-ReID task and traditional L-ReID benchmarks, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Bi-C2R successfully addresses the re-indexing problem in lifelong ReID by enabling compatible feature updates without accessing historical gallery data, making lifelong ReID more practical for real-world applications with privacy constraints.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Conclusion: FoundationSLAM successfully addresses geometric consistency issues in flow-based SLAM, demonstrating practical applicability through real-time performance and robust generalization across diverse environments.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from inpainting to video-to-video editing using Diffusion Transformers to generate ideal training data and achieve precise lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-driven visual dubbing lacks ideal training data where only lip movements differ while other visual conditions remain identical. Existing mask-based inpainting methods force models to simultaneously hallucinate content and sync lips, causing artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization.

Method: Uses a Diffusion Transformer as a data generator to synthesize ideal training data (lip-altered companion videos), then trains a DiT-based audio-driven editor end-to-end on these aligned video pairs. Introduces timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps.

Result: Achieves highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness in challenging in-the-wild scenarios. Also introduces ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation.

Conclusion: Reframing visual dubbing as a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem with complete frame-aligned input conditioning enables superior performance compared to traditional inpainting approaches.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineTec is a unified framework for fine-grained action recognition from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences that uses context-aware completion, spatial decomposition, and physics-driven acceleration estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained action recognition from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation yields substantial missing data. Current approaches fail to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, losing subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions.

Method: FineTec uses a multi-stage approach: 1) context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking to restore base skeleton sequences, 2) skeleton-based spatial decomposition that partitions skeletons into five semantic regions and dynamic/static subgroups with targeted perturbation, 3) physics-driven estimation using Lagrangian dynamics to compute joint accelerations, and 4) GCN-based action recognition head processing both fused skeleton positions and accelerations.

Result: FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks under various temporal corruption levels. It achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% on Gym99-severe and 78.1% on Gym288-severe settings.

Conclusion: FineTec demonstrates robust performance for fine-grained action recognition under temporal corruption by effectively combining context-aware completion, spatial decomposition, and physics-driven acceleration estimation, showing strong generalizability across different datasets and corruption levels.

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r is a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images, enabling fast photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require per-scene optimization, which is slow and computationally expensive. There's a need for fast, feed-forward 3D scene editing that can handle unposed, view-inconsistent images while maintaining 3D consistency.

Method: Uses a SAM2-based recoloring strategy to generate cross-view-consistent supervision and an asymmetric input strategy that pairs recolored reference views with raw auxiliary views to encourage the network to fuse and align disparate observations.

Result: Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, operates at significantly higher inference speed, and can handle images edited by 2D methods like InstructPix2Pix despite not being trained on them.

Conclusion: Edit3r enables fast, photorealistic 3D scene editing without optimization or pose estimation, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications, as demonstrated by comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the new DL3DV-Edit-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

TL;DR: GaMO is a geometry-aware multi-view outpainting framework that improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction by expanding field of view from existing poses instead of generating new viewpoints, achieving better geometric consistency and 25× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for sparse-view 3D reconstruction have limitations: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines.

Method: GaMO reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting, expanding field of view from existing camera poses rather than generating new viewpoints. It uses multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training.

Result: State-of-the-art reconstruction quality on Replica and ScanNet++ datasets across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS metrics, with 25× speedup over SOTA diffusion methods and processing time under 10 minutes.

Conclusion: Multi-view outpainting from existing poses is more effective than generating new viewpoints for sparse-view 3D reconstruction, providing better geometric consistency, broader coverage, and significantly faster processing.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

### [107] [Simultaneous Extrinsic Contact and In-Hand Pose Estimation via Distributed Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23856)
*Mark Van der Merwe,Kei Ota,Dmitry Berenson,Nima Fazeli,Devesh K. Jha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Factor graph approach combining tactile sensing with physical constraints for accurate in-hand object pose and contact estimation during manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise in-hand understanding of object pose and extrinsic contacts is crucial for autonomous manipulation tasks like peg insertion and assembly, but existing methods using tactile or visual sensing alone face challenges with ambiguity, noise, and occlusions.

Method: Proposes a factor graph formulation that pairs local tactile observations with physical constraints of contact, ensuring local consistency with tactile data while enforcing kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions.

Result: The method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available, demonstrating improved accuracy in pose and contact estimation.

Conclusion: Combining local tactile observations with physical contact constraints in a factor graph framework provides more accurate and robust estimation of in-hand object pose and contacts for autonomous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

*Guo Ye,Zexi Zhang,Xu Zhao,Shang Wu,Haoran Lu,Shihan Lu,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamTacVLA enhances Vision-Language-Action models with tactile sensing and future prediction for contact-rich manipulation, achieving 95% success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack physical contact awareness, struggling with force, texture, and slip reasoning in contact-rich manipulation tasks. Existing tactile approaches use low-dimensional signals that miss high-resolution dynamics essential for fine-grained interactions.

Method: Hierarchical perception with tactile images as micro-vision, wrist-camera local vision, and third-person macro vision. Uses Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss to align tactile tokens with spatial counterparts, then finetunes with tactile world model predicting future tactile signals. Trained on hybrid dataset from digital twin and real-world experiments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines across contact-rich manipulation tasks, achieving up to 95% success rate, demonstrating superior contact physics understanding.

Conclusion: DreamTacVLA successfully grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to anticipate tactile futures, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SHIELD is a LiDAR-based drone exploration method that uses spherical-projection hybrid-frontier integration to address LiDAR point cloud quality issues and computational efficiency challenges in UAV exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based UAV exploration faces challenges: 1) LiDAR point clouds have inferior observation quality compared to depth cameras, 2) Traditional frontier methods are computationally heavy with LiDAR's wide FOV, and 3) Raycasting struggles to classify regions without point clouds as free space.

Method: SHIELD uses: 1) Observation-quality occupancy map with ray-casting for consistent point-cloud quality, 2) Hybrid frontier method to reduce computational burden and address point-cloud quality limitations, and 3) Outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy for safety and efficiency in open areas.

Result: Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD in improving exploration efficiency while maintaining flight safety.

Conclusion: SHIELD successfully addresses LiDAR-based drone exploration challenges through its integrated approach, and the work will be open-sourced to benefit the research community.

Abstract: This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.

*Takashi Yamamoto,Hiroaki Yaguchi,Shohei Kato,Hiroyuki Okada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A study explores how users perceive a service robot's dual agency (autonomous vs. operator-mediated) through a User-Robot-Operator triad, finding that different agency modes (autonomous, remote, hybrid) systematically affect user impressions like affinity and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users experience and perceive a service robot's dual agency structure - where one physical robot body can represent both onboard autonomy and operator-mediated control - and how this affects human-robot interaction in domestic tasks.

Method: Developed a prototype combining natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over robot's live camera view for remote intervention. Evaluated three modes (autonomous, remote, hybrid) in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field.

Result: Found systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, showing that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks, demonstrating that agency structure significantly influences user experience and perception.

Abstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.

Conclusion: The integrated high-fidelity simulation platform addresses current limitations in low-altitude UAV traffic simulation by providing comprehensive, realistic testing capabilities with open-source accessibility.

Abstract: Significant challenges are posed by simulation and testing in the field of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic due to the high costs associated with large-scale UAV testing and the complexity of establishing low-altitude traffic test scenarios. Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose robots need both broad generalization (from VLMs) and high-precision execution, but current VLA models struggle with this combination due to insufficient embodied reasoning and precise control trade-offs.

Method: 1) ERIQ: Large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark with 6K+ QA pairs across four reasoning dimensions to decouple reasoning from execution. 2) FACT: Flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control to discrete sequences while preserving trajectory fidelity. 3) GenieReasoner: Joint optimization of reasoning and action in unified space.

Result: ERIQ reveals strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and VLA generalization. GenieReasoner outperforms both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation by enabling systematic evaluation and bridging reasoning to precise execution.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: Social robots can serve as effective moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users by integrating perception, communication, social interaction, and formal specification capabilities, with initial proof-of-concept showing promise for pedestrian advising scenarios.

Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Conclusion: GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation, demonstrating the feasibility of scaling VLA policies to complex bimanual systems with high-DoF hands.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions.

TL;DR: RANGER is a zero-shot semantic navigation framework that uses only monocular vision, eliminating depth/pose dependencies while enabling in-context learning from short videos for quick environment adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot object navigation methods rely too heavily on precise depth/pose information (limiting real-world use) and lack in-context learning capabilities for quick adaptation to new environments.

Method: Uses 3D foundation models with keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, VLM-driven exploration value estimation, adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution - all from monocular camera only.

Result: Achieves competitive navigation success and exploration efficiency on HM3D benchmark and real-world environments, with superior in-context learning adaptability and no prior 3D mapping required.

Conclusion: RANGER demonstrates practical zero-shot semantic navigation without depth/pose dependencies, enabling real-world applicability and quick adaptation through in-context learning from minimal environmental observation.

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

Conclusion: HBO-PID provides accurate and robust trajectory tracking for UAVs by effectively addressing the challenges of underactuated, nonlinear dynamics through intelligent optimization of PID parameters.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.

TL;DR: A neural network-based method for constrained motion planning that predicts robot-obstacle distances in latent space and uses gradient information for local path optimization, reducing replanning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven constrained motion planning methods, particularly latent motion approaches based on manifold approximation, suffer from errors in manifold approximation and difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts in latent space, requiring time-consuming path validity checks and replanning.

Method: Trains a neural network to predict minimum distance between robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs, then uses learned distance gradient to calculate movement direction in latent space to move robot away from obstacles. Integrates local path optimization algorithm in latent space with path validity checking process.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates the fastest planning speed compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces replanning time by integrating learned distance prediction and gradient-based optimization in latent space with validity checking, outperforming existing methods in planning efficiency.

Abstract: Constrained motion planning is a common but challenging problem in robotic manipulation. In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL methods for UGV navigation rely on single-frame observations and simple multi-modal fusion, limiting temporal context capture and dynamic adaptability in crowded environments.

Method: Proposes DRL-TH with two key components: 1) Temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights to capture correlations between consecutive frames, and 2) Graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that uses hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features across multiple scales.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments in experiments, and successfully implemented on a real UGV with good performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DRL-TH effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by capturing temporal context and achieving balanced multi-modal representation, demonstrating superior navigation performance for UGVs in crowded environments.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SiLRI is a state-wise Lagrangian RL algorithm that leverages potentially suboptimal human interventions to accelerate robot manipulation learning without being constrained by human limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL for robot manipulation needs human interventions, but prior methods assume optimal human actions. In reality, humans are suboptimal and make mistakes. Simply mixing intervention data with RL data is inefficient, while pure imitation limits performance. The challenge is how to use noisy, suboptimal human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them.

Method: Formulates online manipulation as constrained RL optimization where constraint bounds at each state are determined by human intervention uncertainty. Introduces state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solves via min-max optimization, jointly optimizing policy and Lagrange multiplier to reach saddle point. Built on human-as-copilot teleoperation system.

Result: Reduces time to reach 90% success rate by at least 50% compared to state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL. Achieves 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle. Effectively exploits suboptimal human interventions.

Conclusion: SiLRI successfully addresses the challenge of leveraging noisy, suboptimal human interventions to accelerate robot manipulation learning without being constrained by human limitations, demonstrating significant performance improvements in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

*Camron Alexander Hirst,Chris Reale,Eric Frew*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel 3D path-following MPC guidance algorithms for fixed-wing drones, with two formulations: static path rate scheduling and dynamic optimization inspired by contouring control, tested successfully at high speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop advanced 3D path-following guidance algorithms for fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems that can handle high-curvature paths at high speeds, improving upon traditional lookahead guidance methods.

Method: Two nonlinear MPC formulations: 1) static reference path rate scheduling over MPC horizon for constant inertial speed, and 2) dynamic optimization of reference path rate inspired by model predictive contouring control for tradeoff between path progression and distance. Both operate on smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves, with control-augmented modeling and system identification of RAAVEN aircraft.

Result: Successful flight tests over high-curvature paths at ground speeds up to 36 m/s, demonstrating real-world feasibility and superior performance compared to baseline lookahead guidance law.

Conclusion: Nonlinear MPC is feasible and effective for 3D path-following guidance in fixed-wing drones, with the dynamic optimization approach providing flexible tradeoff between competing objectives of path progression and distance maintenance.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and flight test results of two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), with specific application to fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems. To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.

Motivation: Need to efficiently validate critical autonomous racing modules like high-speed overtaking and localization, which are challenging aspects of autonomous racing, through comprehensive testing and analysis.

Method: High-fidelity vehicle model as Functional Mockup Unit (FMU), scenario-based initialization with different conditions, fault injection for sensor delays/perturbations, and automated reporting pipeline running up to 3x faster than real-time locally or on GitHub CI/CD.

Result: Implemented complete simulation and reporting pipeline capable of efficiently testing critical autonomous racing modules, validating high-speed maneuvers and localization, with fault injection capabilities and automated analysis reporting.

Conclusion: The automated simulation and reporting pipeline provides an effective framework for validating autonomous racing systems, enabling efficient testing of critical modules, fault injection capabilities, and comprehensive analysis through automated reporting.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

TL;DR: CF-VLA introduces counterfactual reasoning to VLA models for autonomous driving, enabling self-reflection on planned actions before execution to improve safety and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning-augmented VLA models only describe perceptions and intentions without questioning whether planned actions are safe or appropriate, lacking self-reflection capabilities.

Method: CF-VLA generates time-segmented meta-actions summarizing driving intent, then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both meta-actions and visual context to simulate outcomes, identify unsafe behaviors, and output corrected meta-actions that guide final trajectory generation. Uses rollout-filter-label pipeline to mine high-value scenes and label counterfactual reasoning traces for training.

Result: Improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking by only enabling counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: CF-VLA transforms reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, taking a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

TL;DR: End-to-end system generates high-quality, contextually grounded 3D meshes from single RGB-D images in under 1 second for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D meshes are fundamental for robotics but current generation methods are too slow (tens of seconds) and lack contextual grounding (segmentation, scale, pose registration) needed for practical robot perception and planning.

Method: Integrated pipeline combining open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, all optimized for speed and accuracy.

Result: System produces high-quality, contextually grounded 3D meshes from single RGB-D images in under one second, enabling practical use in real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The end-to-end system makes 3D meshes a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning by solving both speed and contextual grounding challenges.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-language models enable semantic-aware fallback maneuvers for autonomous ships to detect out-of-distribution hazards and comply with IMO safety regulations within tight time constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous vessels to detect operational domain departures and execute safe fallback maneuvers within alert-to-takeover gaps, but classical autonomy stacks lack semantic understanding of complex maritime situations (e.g., diver flags, nearby fires).

Method: Semantic Lookout - a camera-only, candidate-constrained VLM fallback maneuver selector that chooses cautious actions from water-valid trajectories while maintaining continuous human authority, using a fast-slow anomaly pipeline for practical implementation.

Result: Sub-10 second models retain most awareness of slower state-of-the-art models; outperforms geometry-only baselines; increases standoff distance on fire hazard scenes; verified end-to-end operation in field tests with 40 harbor scenes.

Conclusion: VLMs can serve as practical semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with IMO regulations, motivating future work on domain-adapted hybrid autonomy combining foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor perception and short-horizon replanning.

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DISF is a novel grasp planning algorithm that integrates contact stability with geometric surface fitting, improving grasp success by optimizing rotation, translation, and gripper aperture sequentially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surface fitting-based grasp planning focuses too much on geometric alignment while ignoring contact stability, leading to unstable grasps due to poor contact point distribution.

Method: Three-step sequential optimization: (1) rotation optimization for contact normal alignment, (2) translation refinement to align gripper origin with object CoM, and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution.

Result: Validated in simulation across 15 objects in Known-shape and Observed-shape settings, with cross-platform execution on three robot-gripper platforms. Real-world validation on UR3e robot showed reduced CoM misalignment and higher grasp success compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DISF successfully integrates contact stability with geometric compatibility, translating to improved grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution by addressing limitations of traditional surface fitting approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PAM introduces a visuomotor policy with adaptive working memory to handle state ambiguity in robotics using a two-stage training approach with hierarchical feature extraction and context routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation where identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories, requiring policies to extract appropriate information from history without computational expense or overfitting.

Method: Two-stage training with hierarchical frame feature extractor for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation, context router with range-specific queries for compact representation, and auxiliary reconstruction objective to ensure effective bottleneck.

Result: PAM supports 300-frame history windows (≈10 seconds) while maintaining inference speeds above 20Hz, handles multiple state ambiguity scenarios simultaneously, and achieves stable training with minimal additional cost.

Conclusion: PAM effectively addresses state ambiguity in robotic manipulation through adaptive working memory, enabling long history windows without sacrificing inference speed or training stability.

Abstract: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/

TL;DR: HMP-DRL combines graph-based global planning with DRL local control using checkpoints and entity-aware rewards for safer, more reliable autonomous navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph planners lack reactivity for dynamic obstacles, while DRL methods lack global context for reaching distant goals. Need a hybrid approach that combines long-range pathfinding with reactive local control for safe navigation in complex human-centric environments.

Method: Hybrid framework using graph-based global planner to generate path, integrated into local DRL policy via checkpoints encoded in state space and reward function. Includes entity-aware reward structure that adjusts safety margins based on semantic type of surrounding agents.

Result: Outperforms other methods including state-of-the-art approaches in success rate, collision rate, and time to reach goal. Validated through extensive testing in realistic simulation from real-world map data.

Conclusion: Integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

Conclusion: RoboMIND 2.0 addresses the data scarcity problem in robotic manipulation research, while the MIND-2 hierarchical framework provides a solution for leveraging this data to achieve robust generalization in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

TL;DR: Lightweight anthropomorphic hand using Bowden cables with rolling-contact joints achieves high force, speed, and dexterity while reducing distal mass by relocating actuators to torso.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots need hands that combine high grasping force, rapid actuation, multiple DOFs, and lightweight design within human-like size constraints, but current designs face trade-offs requiring heavier actuators that limit payload capacity.

Method: Developed a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, combining rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation for single-motor-per-joint control with minimal cable-length deviation, and relocated actuator module to torso.

Result: Hand assembly with 236g distal mass demonstrated reliable dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force, lifting payloads over 100x its own mass, validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed antagonistic cable actuation with rolling-contact joints successfully addresses conflicting requirements for humanoid robotic hands, enabling high performance while maintaining lightweight anthropomorphic design.

Abstract: Humanoid robots toward human-level dexterity require robotic hands capable of simultaneously providing high grasping force, rapid actuation speeds, multiple degrees of freedom, and lightweight structures within human-like size constraints. Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.

Method: VLA-RAIL introduces asynchronous inference linking with two key components: 1) Trajectory Smoother using polynomial fitting to filter noise in action chunks, and 2) Chunk Fuser that ensures position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between successive action chunks.

Result: Experimental validation on dynamic simulation tasks and real-world manipulation shows VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VLA-RAIL provides a key infrastructure for large-scale deployment of VLA models by enabling smooth, continuous, and high-speed robotic action execution through asynchronous inference and advanced trajectory management.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Target search and tracking is crucial for robotic applications like search and rescue, but existing methods struggle with inaccurate prior target information, limited sensing FOV, and computational inefficiency in unknown cluttered environments.

Method: 1) Sigma point-based mutual information approximation for non-Gaussian beliefs using informative sampling; 2) Hierarchical particle structure for global route guidance and adaptive particle adjustment; 3) Reusable belief tree search with rollout evaluation reuse for online trajectory planning.

Result: Outperforms benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, more stable tracking performance, and maintains outstanding computational efficiency in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ReSPIRe provides an effective solution for target search and tracking in challenging environments by combining efficient MI approximation, adaptive particle management, and reusable planning strategies.

Abstract: Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CREPES-X is a hierarchical relative localization system for multi-robot teams that combines IR, UWB, and IMU sensors in a compact hardware design, using two-stage estimation for robust pose estimation without global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-robot relative localization methods struggle with non-line-of-sight degradation, outliers, and efficiency issues when scaling to tens of robots, especially in complex environments without shared environmental features or inertial assumptions.

Method: 1) Compact hardware design with IR LEDs, IR camera, UWB module, and IMU in a 6cm cube; 2) Two-stage hierarchical estimator: single-frame relative estimator for instant poses with closed-form solution and bearing outlier rejection, and multi-frame relative estimator using IMU pre-integration with robocentric relative kinematics and loosely/tightly-coupled optimization.

Result: System shows robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proves resilience in challenging conditions, and achieves RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets, validated through extensive simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: CREPES-X provides an effective hierarchical framework for robust, accurate, and efficient relative localization in multi-robot systems without requiring global information, addressing key challenges in complex environments.

Abstract: Relative localization is critical for cooperation in autonomous multi-robot systems. Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate complex dynamic behaviors for legged robots, achieving faster convergence and better stability than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating dynamic motions for legged robots is challenging with reinforcement learning, requiring extensive reward tuning or demonstrations. Model discrepancy makes transferring policies from simplified models to full-body dynamics difficult.

Method: 1) Pretrain policy using single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns; 2) Use continuation strategy with model homotopy to progressively transfer policy to full-body environment by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between trunk and legs.

Result: The method achieves faster convergence and superior stability during transfer compared to baseline methods, validated on dynamic tasks including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: The continuation-based learning framework with model homotopy effectively bridges the gap between simplified models and full-body dynamics, enabling efficient generation of complex dynamic behaviors for legged robots.

Abstract: Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LSRE converts sparse VLM judgments into latent space decision boundaries for real-time semantic risk assessment in autonomous driving, achieving VLM-level accuracy at 10Hz without per-frame queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world autonomous driving requires understanding complex human social rules beyond traffic laws, but VLMs are too computationally expensive for real-time deployment despite their semantic understanding capabilities.

Method: LSRE framework converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within a recurrent world model's latent space, creating a lightweight latent classifier for semantic risk assessment.

Result: LSRE achieves semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to large VLM baselines, provides earlier hazard anticipation, operates at 10Hz with low latency, and generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases.

Conclusion: Language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving by balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: Edge ML approach enables on-device microrobot locomotion control under severe compute/memory/power constraints using RL-trained compact MLP policies deployed on ultra-small SoC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust autonomous microrobot locomotion with on-device, low-latency control despite extreme compute, memory, and power limitations of sub-centimeter scale robots.

Method: Train compact FP32 MLP policy (2 hidden layers: 128, 64) via RL with massive GPU simulation and domain randomization, then apply integer quantization (Int8) for deployment on ARM Cortex-M0 SoC, with resource-aware gait scheduling based on power budgets.

Result: Successfully deployed quantized MLP policy on real-world robot, showing domain randomization improves out-of-distribution stability, and established power-to-update-frequency model for resource-constrained hardware.

Conclusion: Edge ML with RL and quantization enables practical microrobot locomotion control on ultra-constrained hardware, with domain randomization enhancing robustness and resource-aware scheduling optimizing performance within power budgets.

Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$μ$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

TL;DR: Dream2Flow bridges video generation models to robotic control using 3D object flow as an intermediate representation, enabling zero-shot manipulation of diverse objects without task-specific demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative video models can reason about plausible physical interactions, there's a gap in translating these human-led motions into executable low-level robotic actions. The challenge is bridging the "embodiment gap" between video generation and robotic control.

Method: Dream2Flow uses 3D object flow as an intermediate representation: 1) generates videos from initial images and task instructions, 2) reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos, 3) formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking, 4) converts 3D flow to low-level commands via trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning.

Result: The framework enables zero-shot manipulation of diverse object categories (rigid, articulated, deformable, granular) without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation to robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 3D object flow serves as an effective intermediate representation that bridges generative video models and robotic control, overcoming the embodiment gap and enabling zero-shot guidance for open-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: ArtiSG constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations to bridge the gap between semantic scene understanding and physical manipulation capabilities for articulated objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene graphs lack functional information for manipulation, especially for articulated objects. Current approaches suffer from visual ambiguity, constrained settings, and miss fine-grained functional elements like small handles.

Method: Uses a portable setup to collect human demonstration data for accurate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes estimation under camera ego-motion. Integrates kinematic priors into hierarchical open-vocabulary graphs and uses interaction data to discover missed functional elements.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. The constructed graph serves as reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments.

Conclusion: ArtiSG successfully bridges the gap between semantic scene understanding and physical manipulation by encoding human demonstrations into functional 3D scene graphs, enabling robots to handle diverse articulated objects in real-world settings.

Abstract: 3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.

TL;DR: A framework combining hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking for manipulating deformable linear objects in constrained environments with obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLO manipulation is challenging due to high-dimensional state space, complex deformation dynamics, and obstacles in realistic workspaces, requiring efficient planning and robust tracking.

Method: Hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking: 1) Generate spatial path set satisfying homotopic constraints for DLO keypoints, 2) Path-set-guided optimization for optimal temporal deformation sequence, 3) Neural model predictive control with data-driven deformation model for accurate tracking.

Result: The framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks, demonstrating effective performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses DLO manipulation challenges in constrained environments through combined hierarchical planning and neural tracking approaches.

Abstract: Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Result: Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Validated on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Hand-eye coordination proved critical for success in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments through modular teleoperation and the Choice Policy learning framework.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning.

### [142] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDFT, a protocol to measure epistemic robustness - how well language models maintain factual accuracy under semantic compression and adversarial fabrication, finding that robustness is orthogonal to model size/architecture and depends on verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model evaluations (like MMLU, TruthfulQA) only measure knowledge under ideal conditions, not how robustly models maintain accuracy when information degrades or under adversarial probing. There's a need to distinguish models that truly know facts from those whose verification mechanisms fail under stress.

Method: Introduced Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT) protocol to measure epistemic robustness. Proposed a two-system cognitive model with Semantic System (generates text) and Epistemic Verifier (validates facts). Evaluated 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations).

Result: Epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms: neither parameter count (r=0.083) nor architectural type (r=0.153) significantly predicts robustness. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817). Flagship models show brittleness despite scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance.

Conclusion: Epistemic robustness emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. DDFT provides theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications, challenging assumptions about model size-reliability relationship.

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

TL;DR: SPARK is a multi-agent LLM framework for personalized search using specialized persona-based agents that coordinate to deliver context-aware retrieval and emergent personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search systems struggle with static profiles and monolithic pipelines that can't capture users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs. There's a need for systems that can model the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

Method: SPARK uses coordinated persona-based LLM agents with formalized persona spaces (role, expertise, task context, domain). A Persona Coordinator dynamically interprets queries to activate relevant specialized agents. Each agent performs independent retrieval-augmented generation with dedicated memory stores and reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration uses structured communication protocols including shared memory, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer.

Result: The framework yields testable predictions about coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution. It incorporates adaptive learning for continuous persona refinement and demonstrates how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors with minimal coordination rules.

Conclusion: SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems by integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, enabling systems to better capture the complexity of human information-seeking behavior through distributed, coordinated agent architectures.

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROAD is a novel prompt optimization framework that uses multi-agent debugging instead of labeled datasets, achieving significant performance improvements in both academic benchmarks and production systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APO methods require large labeled datasets which are unavailable during cold-start agent development, while real-world scenarios only provide messy production logs and evolving failure modes.

Method: ROAD uses a specialized multi-agent architecture (Analyzer for root-cause analysis, Optimizer for pattern aggregation, Coach for strategy integration) to convert unstructured failure logs into structured Decision Tree Protocols, treating optimization as dynamic debugging rather than stochastic search.

Result: ROAD achieved 5.6% increase in success rate (73.6% to 79.2%) and 3.8% increase in search accuracy within three iterations, plus 19% improvement on complex retail reasoning tasks, demonstrating high sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Mimicking human engineering loops of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

*Chunhui Wan,Xunan Dai,Zhuo Wang,Minglei Li,Yanpeng Wang,Yinan Mao,Yu Lan,Zhiwen Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow is a self-evolving agent framework that integrates LLMs into evolutionary search via a "Plan-Execute-Summarize" paradigm and hybrid evolutionary memory, achieving state-of-the-art solution quality with 60% better efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evolutionary approaches for LLM self-improvement lack structured reasoning, suffer from premature convergence, and inefficiently explore high-dimensional code spaces, hindering the transition from static LLMs to self-improving agents.

Method: LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm and incorporates a hybrid evolutionary memory system combining Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection to balance exploration-exploitation trade-off and maintain diverse behavioral niches.

Result: Extensive evaluations on AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions show LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions.

Conclusion: LoongFlow represents a substantial advancement in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead by effectively mapping evolutionary search to reasoning-heavy processes.

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

### [148] [CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113)
*Jiaxin Hu,Tao Wang,Bingsan Yang,Hongrun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogRec combines LLMs with Soar cognitive architecture to create an interpretable recommender agent that learns online through LLM-guided rule generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong preference understanding but suffer from black-box nature, hallucination, and poor online learning. Cognitive architectures like Soar offer interpretable reasoning but require laborious knowledge acquisition. The paper aims to combine their complementary strengths.

Method: CogRec uses Soar as symbolic reasoning engine with LLM for knowledge initialization. It operates on Perception-Cognition-Action cycles, queries LLM when encountering impasses, and transforms LLM solutions into symbolic production rules via Soar's chunking mechanism for online learning.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three public datasets show CogRec achieves significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and effectiveness in addressing the long-tail problem.

Conclusion: The proposed CogRec agent successfully synergizes LLMs and cognitive architectures to create a trustworthy, interpretable recommender system with robust online learning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

TL;DR: Training-free graph-based approach for ARC-AGI-3 benchmark using vision processing and systematic state-space exploration with graph representations, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI-3 benchmark tasks require interactive reasoning where agents must infer mechanics through limited interactions, and current state-of-the-art LLMs fail to reliably solve these tasks, highlighting the need for systematic exploration approaches.

Method: Combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. Segments visual frames, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, maintains directed graph of explored states and transitions, and tracks visited states to prioritize shortest paths to untested state-action pairs.

Result: Solves median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games on ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, ranking 3rd on private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: Explicit graph-structured exploration without learning serves as strong baseline for interactive reasoning, demonstrating importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility.

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning approach (FRIPN) solves Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem efficiently, integrating fleet composition and routing decisions for near-optimal solutions in seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSMVRP is complex due to simultaneous fleet composition and routing decisions, especially challenging in large-scale, time-constrained real-world applications like vehicle rental and on-demand logistics.

Method: Formulate FSMVRP as Markov Decision Process, develop FRIPN policy network with specialized input embeddings including remaining graph embedding for vehicle employment decisions.

Result: Method achieves near-optimal solutions within seconds, shows computational efficiency and scalability advantages in large-scale, time-constrained scenarios on random and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The DRL-based approach has practical application potential and provides inspiration for extending similar techniques to other VRP variants.

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

### [152] [Constrained Language Model Policy Optimization via Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24263)
*Lijun Zhang,Lin Li,Wei Wei,Yajie Qi,Huizhong Song,Jun Wang,Yaodong Yang,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RSA is a risk-aware alignment method that uses nested risk measures to control safety risks during LM fine-tuning, addressing both excessive model shift and rare catastrophic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods (like Safe RLHF and SACPO) operate under risk-neutral paradigms that are insufficient for controlling risks from policy deviations and offer limited robustness against rare but catastrophic harmful behaviors.

Method: RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through stepwise alignment with token-level policy updates derived from nested risk measures.

Result: Experimental results show RSA achieves high helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks (low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses).

Conclusion: RSA provides a theoretically grounded risk-aware alignment approach that effectively mitigates risks from excessive model shift and suppresses rare catastrophic behaviors, improving safety and trustworthiness in LM fine-tuning.

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents operating under partial observability need better ways to align with latent world states without requiring extensive retraining or gradient-based updates.

Method: Agent maintains external structured belief over environment state, iteratively updates via action-conditioned observations, selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain using lightweight LLM-based surrogate, and uses novel reward for world alignment consistency.

Result: Outperforms inference-time scaling baselines (prompt-augmented/retrieval-enhanced LLMs) in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Conclusion: Posterior-guided belief refinement enables effective test-time adaptation for LLM agents in partially observable environments without requiring gradient updates or additional training.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI agents that can solve diverse physical tasks and generalize to unseen environments by improving planning efficiency through abstraction in learned representation spaces.

Method: Characterized JEPA-WMs (world models planning in representation space), conducted comprehensive study of model architecture, training objectives, and planning algorithms using simulated environments and real-world robotic data.

Result: Proposed model outperforms established baselines DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Planning in learned representation space (JEPA-WMs) is effective for physical task solving, with optimal combinations of architecture, training objectives, and planning algorithms yielding state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: Interactive evaluation framework for analyzing how foundation model agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments, revealing distinct roles of exploration, memory, and reasoning components in spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of spatial ability in foundation models rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding needed for reliable map-based reasoning and applications.

Method: Proposed interactive evaluation framework where agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps (roads, intersections, POIs) with local observations, then evaluated on six spatial tasks. Systematically varied exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models.

Result: Exploration affects experience acquisition but has limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. Memory representation plays central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories (sequential and graph-based) substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks like path planning. Reasoning schemes shape how stored knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. Spatial reasoning performance saturates beyond certain capability thresholds.

Conclusion: Improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone, as performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond certain capability thresholds.

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with underrepresented math competition problems, especially Geometry, with DeepSeek-V3 performing best but still making computational/logical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM math reasoning studies use the same benchmark datasets, limiting generalizability and failing to capture diverse mathematical challenges. This study aims to analyze LLM performance on underrepresented mathematics competition problems to better understand their limitations.

Method: Tested three leading LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, DeepSeek-V3) on Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. Compared LLM responses to known correct solutions and analyzed reasoning patterns across problem types and models.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 performed best across all three categories. All LLMs showed notably weak performance in Geometry. DeepSeek-V3 errors were mainly computational/logical, GPT-4o-mini had logical/approach errors, and Gemini struggled with incomplete reasoning and rushed conclusions.

Conclusion: Evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets reveals distinct error patterns and highlights ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly in Geometry, providing deeper insights into LLM limitations.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong general language capabilities but struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments, limiting applications in navigation and planning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) to build physics awareness; 2) Freeze physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within GRPO framework for multi-step planning in puzzle environments using synthesized ASCII-art dataset and environment.

Result: Method consistently outperforms baselines (generic backbone, physics-aware model, end-to-end RL models) in both Dynamic and Static environments, converges faster, exhibits more stable training, and shows meaningful improvements in spatial understanding via attention pattern analysis.

Conclusion: Decomposing spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks with physics-aware fine-tuning followed by compositional planning with LoRA adapters is effective for improving LLM spatial reasoning, enabling better performance in structured environments with faster convergence and stable training.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities.

TL;DR: RLMs enable LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts via recursive self-calling, handling inputs 100x beyond context windows with better quality and comparable cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited context windows that restrict their ability to process arbitrarily long prompts, creating a need for inference-time scaling solutions.

Method: Propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs) - an inference strategy where LLMs treat long prompts as external environments, programmatically examining, decomposing, and recursively calling themselves over prompt snippets.

Result: RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows, dramatically outperform base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, with comparable or cheaper cost per query.

Conclusion: RLMs provide an effective general inference strategy for processing arbitrarily long prompts, offering superior performance and scalability while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well individually but lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings, needing better coordination for complex workflows.

Method: Reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as Dec-POMDP, adopts CTDE, introduces GRPO for joint policy optimization with global signals, and uses simplified joint reward balancing task quality, speed, and coordination cost.

Result: 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in collaborative writing, and 74.6% test pass rate in coding, consistently outperforming strong multi-agent LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows by enabling effective multi-agent coordination through RL-augmented LLMs with global optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent frameworks have high configuration costs (extensive manual effort for tool integration/prompt engineering) and static capabilities (struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning).

Method: Proposes Youtu-Agent with structured configuration system decoupling execution environments, toolkits, and context management.

Conclusion: Youtu-Agent effectively addresses configuration costs and static capability limitations through automated generation and continuous evolution, demonstrating strong performance across multiple benchmarks and practical applications.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

*Pengcheng Xia,Yixiang Huang,Chengjin Qin,Chengliang Liu*

TL;DR: Multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis achieves better generalization under unseen working conditions by decoupling modality/domain features and fusing multi-modal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault diagnosis methods suffer performance decline under unseen working conditions, domain adaptation relies on target domain samples, and single-modal approaches overlook complementary multi-modal information for better generalization.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement framework to decouple modality-invariant/specific features and domain-invariant/specific representations, plus cross-domain mixed fusion strategy and triple-modal fusion mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on induction motor fault diagnosis show the method consistently outperforms advanced methods under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions, with ablation studies verifying each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in fault diagnosis by leveraging multi-modal information and domain adaptation without target domain samples, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BatteryAgent: A hierarchical LLM-based framework for interpretable multi-type battery fault diagnosis that combines physical features with AI reasoning, outperforming black-box deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for battery fault diagnosis lack interpretability (black-box nature) and are limited to binary classification, preventing root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations.

Method: Three-layer framework: (1) Physical Perception Layer with 10 mechanism-based electrochemical features, (2) Detection and Attribution Layer using Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP for feature contribution analysis, (3) Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer with LLM as agent core that bridges numerical SHAP attributions with mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.986, effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and extends binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis.

Conclusion: BatteryAgent enables a paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" by providing interpretable, comprehensive fault analysis with root causes and maintenance suggestions, advancing battery safety management.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

*Emmanuel Fashae,Michael Burke,Leimin Tian,Lingheng Meng,Pamela Carreno-Medrano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces four interpretable constructs for object arrangement preferences and validates them through a questionnaire study, then integrates them into an MCTS planner for robotic rearrangement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems use latent preference models from human demonstrations that lack interpretability, making it hard to understand what factors guide human decisions in object arrangement.

Method: 1) Designed and validated a self-report questionnaire measuring four constructs (spatial practicality, habitual convenience, semantic coherence, commonsense appropriateness) through a 63-participant online study; 2) Integrated these constructs into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner for robotic rearrangement.

Result: The questionnaire study confirmed the psychological distinctiveness of the four constructs and their explanatory power across kitchen and living room scenarios. The MCTS planner guided by participant-derived preferences generated reasonable arrangements that closely aligned with human-generated arrangements.

Conclusion: The work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and demonstrates how it can be operationalized for robot planning, moving beyond black-box latent models to more transparent preference modeling.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

### [166] [GenZ: Foundational models as latent variable generators within traditional statistical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24834)
*Marko Jojic,Nebojsa Jojic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenZ is a hybrid model combining LLMs with statistical modeling to discover interpretable semantic features that capture dataset-specific patterns, outperforming pure LLM baselines on house price prediction and movie recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have broad domain knowledge but fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. There's a need to bridge foundational models with statistical modeling to discover interpretable features that reflect actual data patterns rather than just general domain knowledge.

Method: Uses an iterative process contrasting groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors to discover semantic feature descriptions. Formulated as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. Prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships.

Result: On house price prediction: 12% median relative error vs 38% for GPT-5 baseline. On Netflix movie embeddings: predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity from semantic descriptions alone, matching performance that would require ~4000 user ratings in traditional collaborative filtering.

Conclusion: GenZ successfully bridges foundational models and statistical modeling, discovering dataset-specific semantic features that outperform pure LLM approaches. The method reveals patterns (architectural details for housing, franchise membership for movies) that diverge from the model's general domain knowledge, demonstrating the value of combining statistical error analysis with LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

*Koki Suenaga,Tomohiro Furuta,Satoshi Ono*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a constraint extraction method using templates to automatically generate work schedules for long-term care facilities by identifying facility-specific constraints while excluding exceptional cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term care facilities have varying conditions between facilities, requiring interviews with managers to design facility-specific constraint conditions for shift scheduling. Existing methods lack mechanisms to handle exceptional constraints.

Method: Uses constraint templates to extract combinations of various components like shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. Templates can extract diverse constraints by adjusting parameters (days, staff count, focus on patterns/frequency) and incorporate mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints.

Result: Experiments showed the method successfully created schedules satisfying all hard constraints and reduced soft constraint violations by avoiding extraction of exceptional constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed constraint extraction method with template-based approach and exceptional constraint exclusion mechanisms effectively generates work schedules tailored to specific long-term care facility requirements.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering.

Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

TL;DR: Iterative deployment of LLMs with user-curated data from previous models leads to significant improvements in planning skills and emergent generalization, effectively implementing implicit reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how iterative deployment of LLMs with user-curated data affects model properties and planning capabilities, and to explore the connection between this deployment pattern and reinforcement learning.

Method: Iteratively deploy LLMs where each new model is fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from previous models' deployments. Test this mechanism on various planning domains and analyze the theoretical connection to reinforcement learning.

Result: Substantial improvements in planning skills with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than initial models. Theoretical analysis shows iterative deployment effectively implements RL training with an implicit reward function.

Conclusion: Iterative deployment with user-curated data creates an implicit RL training loop with important implications for AI safety (due to undefined reward functions) and offers an alternative training regime to explicit RL through data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a specialized agentic LLM that can handle complex spatio-temporal reasoning tasks while maintaining general capabilities, addressing the need for domain-specific agents that don't sacrifice broad functionality.

Method: Three key contributions: 1) Stable tool environment with 10+ domain-specific tools for asynchronous rollout/training; 2) Hierarchical data curation framework with 1:10,000 filter ratio for high-quality queries; 3) Cascaded training recipe with seed SFT (guardian), second SFT (high certainty), and RL (low certainty) stages.

Result: STAgent shows promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining general capabilities across wide-ranging benchmarks, demonstrating effective spatio-temporal understanding without sacrificing general functionality.

Conclusion: STAgent successfully demonstrates that specialized agentic models for spatio-temporal tasks can be developed with effective tool interaction, data curation, and training strategies while preserving general LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.
