To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI).

Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights.

LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process.

However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG.

When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results.

To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images.

We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank.

Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory.

Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPIM enables sampling-based inspection planners to use neural SDFs directly, reducing memory usage by up to 70x while maintaining trajectory quality.", "motivation": "Aging infrastructure requires efficient inspection planning, but current sampling-based planners use too much memory for large complex structures.

Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces.

This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted.

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance.
