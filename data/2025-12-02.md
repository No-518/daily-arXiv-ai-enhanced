Result: Neural network provided best balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Reliable real-time gesture recognition achieved on WeBe Band, demonstrating potential for secure, fast-response medical monitoring solutions.

Conclusion: Efficient motion-based models using only triaxial accelerometer sensors can be built with AutoML feature extraction, enabling practical on-device gesture recognition for medical monitoring applications requiring low latency and reliability.

Abstract: The use of tiny devices capable of low-latency gesture recognition is gaining momentum in everyday human-computer interaction and especially in medical monitoring fields. Embedded solutions such as fall detection, rehabilitation tracking, and patient supervision require fast and efficient tracking of movements while avoiding unwanted false alarms. This study presents an efficient solution on how to build very efficient motion-based models only using triaxial accelerometer sensors. We explore the capability of the AutoML pipelines to extract the most important features from the data segments. This approach also involves training multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms using the extracted features. We use WeBe Band, a multi-sensor wearable device that is equipped with a powerful enough MCU to effectively perform gesture recognition entirely on the device. Of the models explored, we found that the neural network provided the best balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Our results also demonstrate that reliable real-time gesture recognition can be achieved in WeBe Band, with great potential for real-time medical monitoring solutions that require a secure and fast response time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal reasoning has advanced through algorithmic improvements like reinforcement learning, the data-centric foundations remain underexplored. Standardized exam questions provide a rigorous testbed for evaluating multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured visual contexts and verifiable answers.

Method: Compiled a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum-aligned diagrams, and contextual materials. Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax called QMSA (Question-Method-Solution-Answer).

Result: Achieved 78.6% accuracy on the newly released YKSUniform benchmark (1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics), only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash. This demonstrates that supervised fine-tuning with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches.

Conclusion: Data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. Carefully curated, curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance, establishing a data-centric framework for advancing open-weight vision language models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Proposes Satellite-to-Street: a dual-input U-Net framework for pixel-level damage assessment from satellite imagery using class-aware loss to handle class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual satellite imagery interpretation for post-disaster damage assessment is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. Existing deep learning models struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, leading to poor detection of highly damaged regions.

Method: Modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both local structural changes and broader contextual cues. Uses class-aware weighted loss functions to handle dominance of undamaged pixels in disaster datasets.

Result: Experiments on public disaster datasets show improved localization and classification of structural damage compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models.

Conclusion: The framework provides rapid, consistent damage maps to support (not replace) expert decision-making, enabling more efficient, data-driven disaster management.

Abstract: Accurate post-disaster damage assessment is of high importance for prioritizing emergency response; however, manual interpretation of satellite imagery is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.

### [6] [ProvRain: Rain-Adaptive Denoising and Vehicle Detection via MobileNet-UNet and Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00073)
*Aswinkumar Varathakumaran,Nirmala Paramanandham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProvRain pipeline combines MobileNet-U-Net denoising with curricula training to improve provident vehicle detection in rainy nighttime conditions, achieving significant accuracy gains over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provident vehicle detection at night faces challenges from weather noise (rain/snow) and camera conditions, which degrade detection accuracy before vehicles appear directly in camera view.

Method: Developed ProvRain pipeline using lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture with curricula training to generalize to robust weather conditions, trained on mix of synthetic and PVDN dataset data, compared against Faster RCNN baseline.

Result: 8.94% increase in accuracy and 10.25% increase in recall for vehicle detection in rainy nighttime frames; MobileNet-U-Net shows 10-15% PSNR improvement, 5-6% SSIM increase, and up to 67% reduction in perceptual error compared to transformer approaches.

Conclusion: The ProvRain pipeline effectively handles weather noise while maintaining provident vehicle detection accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods for nighttime rainy conditions.

Abstract: Provident vehicle detection has a lot of scope in the detection of vehicle during night time. The extraction of features other than the headlamps of vehicles allows us to detect oncoming vehicles before they appear directly on the camera. However, it faces multiple issues especially in the field of night vision, where a lot of noise caused due to weather conditions such as rain or snow as well as camera conditions. This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames. Similarly, the custom MobileNet-U-Net architecture that was trained also shows a 10-15\% improvement in PSNR, a 5-6\% increase in SSIM, and upto a 67\% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to other transformer approaches.

### [7] [Adapter Shield: A Unified Framework with Built-in Authentication for Preventing Unauthorized Zero-Shot Image-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00075)
*Jun Jia,Hongyi Miao,Yingjie Zhou,Wangqiu Zhou,Jianbo Zhang,Linhan Cao,Dandan Zhu,Hua Yang,Xiongkuo Min,Wei Sun,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapter Shield: A universal defense system that protects personal images from unauthorized zero-shot image generation by encrypting image embeddings and using adversarial perturbations to distort outputs for unauthorized users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot image-to-image generation enables high-fidelity replication of faces and artistic styles without model modification, creating serious intellectual property risks including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. Current methods lack effective protection against misuse.

Method: 1) Analyze how zero-shot methods use image encoders to extract embeddings fed into diffusion models via cross-attention. 2) Create reversible encryption system mapping original embeddings to encrypted representations using secret keys. 3) Design multi-target adversarial perturbation method that shifts original embeddings toward encrypted patterns. 4) Authorized users can restore authentic embeddings with decryption module and correct key.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users. Protected images produce distorted/encrypted outputs for unauthorized users.

Conclusion: Adapter Shield provides the first universal and authentication-integrated solution for defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios, balancing protection with legitimate creative use through cryptographic access control.

Abstract: With the rapid progress in diffusion models, image synthesis has advanced to the stage of zero-shot image-to-image generation, where high-fidelity replication of facial identities or artistic styles can be achieved using just one portrait or artwork, without modifying any model weights. Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models can generate realistic synthetic brightfield microscopy images that improve cell detection performance while reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks in brightfield microscopy limit deep learning progress for single cell detection, creating need for synthetic data solutions.

Method: Trained U-Net based diffusion model to generate synthetic images, created datasets with varying synthetic/real ratios, tested with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR detection models, conducted human expert survey for realism evaluation.

Result: Synthetic data improved detection accuracies at minimal cost; human experts couldn't distinguish synthetic from real images (50% accuracy); diffusion-based generation shows promise for augmenting real datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising approach for microscopy image analysis, reducing reliance on manual annotation and potentially improving cell detection model robustness.

Abstract: Accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy is crucial for biological research, yet data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks limit the progress of deep learning methods. We investigate the use of unconditional models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images and evaluate their impact on object detection performance. A U-Net based diffusion model was trained and used to create datasets with varying ratios of synthetic and real images. Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs). A human expert survey demonstrates the high realism of generated images, with experts not capable to distinguish them from real microscopy images (accuracy 50%). Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models.

### [9] [Conceptual Evaluation of Deep Visual Stereo Odometry for the MARWIN Radiation Monitoring Robot in Accelerator Tunnels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00080)
*André Dehne,Juri Zach,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) to improve autonomous navigation for the MARWIN robot in accelerator tunnels, addressing limitations of current lidar-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARWIN robot navigation in European XFEL accelerator tunnels relies on lidar-based edge detection, wheel/lidar odometry with QR-code referencing, and fuzzy control. This approach lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles, prompting exploration of more adaptable vision-based solutions.

Method: The paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as an alternative. DVSO uses stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data, with potential fusion with absolute references or other sensors for global consistency.

Result: Conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments (using European XFEL as case study) shows expected benefits: reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection. Challenges identified include low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and radiation robustness.

Conclusion: The paper defines a research agenda toward enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures using vision-based approaches, addressing current limitations while acknowledging remaining technical challenges.

Abstract: The MARWIN robot operates at the European XFEL to perform autonomous radiation monitoring in long, monotonous accelerator tunnels where conventional localization approaches struggle. Its current navigation concept combines lidar-based edge detection, wheel/lidar odometry with periodic QR-code referencing, and fuzzy control of wall distance, rotation, and longitudinal position. While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study. Expected benefits include reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection, while challenges remain in low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and robustness under radiation. The paper defines a research agenda toward enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures.

*Divendar Murtadak,Yoon Kim,Trilokya Akula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diagnostic prompting improves MLLM reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon search results, with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297, though absolute performance remains modest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP), addressing the gap in MLLM-based evaluation alignment with human judgments.

Method: Compared diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations, analyzed decision trees to understand reasoning patterns, and conducted failure case analysis.

Result: Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's κ = 0.071). Models prioritize visual design elements while humans emphasize content similarity, showing partial alignment in reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: Diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, but persistent challenges in visual perception (particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment) require continued research, refinement in prompting approaches, and larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

Abstract: This study investigates whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP). We compare diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations. Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements in predicting human complexity judgments, with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858\% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's $κ$ = 0.071). The decision tree revealed that models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6\% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity, suggesting partial alignment in reasoning patterns. Failure case analysis reveals persistent challenges in MLLM visual perception, particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment. Our findings indicate that diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, though failure cases with consistent human-MLLM disagreement require continued research and refinement in prompting approaches with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

*Venkata Siddharth Dhara,Pawan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastTextDiff is a label-efficient diffusion-based medical image segmentation model that integrates clinical text annotations via ModernBERT to reduce reliance on expensive pixel-wise labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based segmentation models require dense pixel-wise labels that are expensive, time-consuming, and need expert knowledge. There's a need for more label-efficient approaches in medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes FastTextDiff which integrates ModernBERT (trained on MIMIC-III/IV clinical notes) to link textual annotations with medical image semantics. Uses cross-modal attention between visual and textual features, benefits from FlashAttention 2, alternating attention mechanism, and 2-trillion-token corpus.

Result: ModernBERT serves as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion pipelines. FastTextDiff improves both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: The study validates ModernBERT's effectiveness in multi-modal diffusion segmentation and highlights the promise of integrating clinical text annotations for more label-efficient medical image analysis.

Abstract: In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

### [12] [Multi-modal On-Device Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation on Ultra-low-power MCUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00086)
*Davide Nadalini,Manuele Rusci,Elia Cereda,Luca Benini,Francesco Conti,Daniele Palossi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal on-device learning for monocular depth estimation on ultra-low-power IoT platforms using sparse updates to adapt to new environments with minimal energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation on ULP IoT platforms suffers accuracy drops due to domain shift when sensor data differs from training data, requiring adaptation to new environments without excessive energy consumption.

Method: Uses a multi-modal setup with a monocular camera and 8x8 depth sensor on a GAP9 MCU. Normally runs a tiny 107k-parameter μPyD-Net model. Activates depth sensor only for pseudo-label collection in new environments, then performs on-device fine-tuning with a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme to minimize memory usage.

Result: Reduces fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB (2.2x less than full update) with minimal accuracy drops (2% on KITTI, 1.5% on NYUv2). In-field tests show ODL completes in 17.8 minutes, reducing RMSE from 4.9m to 0.6m using only 3k self-labeled samples.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical on-device learning for monocular depth estimation on ULP IoT platforms, enabling adaptation to new environments with minimal energy consumption and memory overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in enabling spatially-aware applications in Ultra-low-power (ULP) Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. However, the limited number of parameters of Deep Neural Networks for the MDE task, designed for IoT nodes, results in severe accuracy drops when the sensor data observed in the field shifts significantly from the training dataset. To address this domain shift problem, we present a multi-modal On-Device Learning (ODL) technique, deployed on an IoT device integrating a Greenwaves GAP9 MicroController Unit (MCU), a 80 mW monocular camera and a 8 x 8 pixel depth sensor, consuming $\approx$300mW. In its normal operation, this setup feeds a tiny 107 k-parameter $μ$PyD-Net model with monocular images for inference. The depth sensor, usually deactivated to minimize energy consumption, is only activated alongside the camera to collect pseudo-labels when the system is placed in a new environment. Then, the fine-tuning task is performed entirely on the MCU, using the new data. To optimize our backpropagation-based on-device training, we introduce a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme, which minimizes the fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB, 2.2x less than a full update, while preserving accuracy (i.e., only 2% and 1.5% drops on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets). Our in-field tests demonstrate, for the first time, that ODL for MDE can be performed in 17.8 minutes on the IoT node, reducing the root mean squared error from 4.9 to 0.6m with only 3 k self-labeled samples, collected in a real-life deployment scenario.

Motivation: Current classroom observation methods rely on manual annotation which is resource-intensive and hard to scale, creating a need for automated systems to provide concrete feedback to teachers.

Method: Parallel modality-specific pipelines: for video analysis, evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels; for transcripts, fine-tune transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. Use techniques like per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video analysis and 0.460 for transcript analysis on a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establishes a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems, with fine-tuned models showing superior performance over prompting-based approaches.

Abstract: Observation of classroom interactions can provide concrete feedback to teachers, but current methods rely on manual annotation, which is resource-intensive and hard to scale. This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemImage converts text documents into 2D semantic images where words are pixels in HSV color space, with Hue encoding topic, Saturation encoding sentiment, and Value encoding certainty, processed by CNNs for document classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a visual representation of text documents that makes linguistic features (topic, sentiment, certainty) visible and interpretable while leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks for document classification.

Method: Represent each word as a pixel in a 2D image with rows as sentences and boundary rows between sentences. Map word embeddings to HSV color space where Hue encodes topic (with circular encoding), Saturation encodes sentiment, and Value encodes intensity/certainty. Use multi-task learning with ColorMapper network and auxiliary supervision for topic and sentiment prediction. Process with standard 2D CNNs like ResNet.

Result: Achieves competitive or better accuracy than strong baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) on multi-label and single-label document classification benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm importance of multi-channel HSV representation and dynamic boundary rows. Visualizations show clear patterns for topic shifts and sentiment changes.

Conclusion: SemImage provides an effective, interpretable visual representation of text documents that enables competitive document classification performance while making linguistic features visible to both humans and machines through semantic imagery.

Abstract: We propose SemImage, a novel method for representing a text document as a two-dimensional semantic image to be processed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleViT, a teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer, improves wildfire forecasting up to 4 months ahead by integrating local fire drivers, global fields, and teleconnection indices through multi-scale fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term wildfire forecasting (weeks to months ahead) is challenging but crucial for resource allocation and fuel management. While short-term predictions rely on local weather, long-term forecasting requires accounting for Earth's interconnectedness through global patterns and teleconnections.

Method: TeleViT uses an asymmetric tokenization strategy to create heterogeneous tokens from (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. These tokens are processed jointly by a transformer encoder, with a decoder preserving spatial structure by mapping local tokens to prediction patches.

Result: TeleViT outperforms U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times (up to 4 months) on the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021). At 4-month lead, TeleViT maintains AUPRC 0.601-0.603 vs. ViT 0.582 and U-Net 0.578. Best performance in seasonally consistent regimes like African savannas, lower in boreal/arid regions.

Conclusion: Architectures that explicitly encode large-scale Earth-system context (like TeleViT) can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales, with predictions relying mainly on local tokens while global fields and indices provide coarse contextual information.

Abstract: Forecasting wildfires weeks to months in advance is difficult, yet crucial for planning fuel treatments and allocating resources. While short-term predictions typically rely on local weather conditions, long-term forecasting requires accounting for the Earth's interconnectedness, including global patterns and teleconnections. We introduce TeleViT, a Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer that integrates (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. This multi-scale fusion is achieved through an asymmetric tokenization strategy that produces heterogeneous tokens processed jointly by a transformer encoder, followed by a decoder that preserves spatial structure by mapping local tokens to their corresponding prediction patches.
  Using the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021, 8-day resolution), TeleViT improves AUPRC performance over U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times, including horizons up to four months. At zero lead, TeleViT with indices and global inputs reaches AUPRC 0.630 (ViT 0.617, U-Net 0.620), at 16x8day lead (around 4 months), TeleViT variants using global input maintain 0.601-0.603 (ViT 0.582, U-Net 0.578), while surpassing the climatology (0.572) at all lead times. Regional results show the highest skill in seasonally consistent fire regimes, such as African savannas, and lower skill in boreal and arid regions. Attention and attribution analyses indicate that predictions rely mainly on local tokens, with global fields and indices contributing coarse contextual information. These findings suggest that architectures explicitly encoding large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.

*Karam Mawas,Mehdi Maboudi,Pedro Achanccaray,Markus Gerke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated quality control method for 3D concrete printing filaments that works with both extrusion-based and shotcrete techniques, using various sensors and applicable to fresh or cured materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AEC industry needs sustainable construction methods, and 3D concrete printing requires precise quality control of filaments/layers since they define the printed structure's geometry.

Method: Developed an automated QC procedure for filaments in both extrusion-based and SC3DP methods, with a sensor-agnostic workflow (works with cameras, structured light systems, or laser scanners) applicable to fresh or cured materials.

Result: Created a versatile quality control system that enables both online (during printing) and post-printing quality assessment for 3D concrete printing.

Conclusion: The proposed automated QC method provides flexible, sensor-independent quality control for 3D concrete printing filaments, supporting both real-time monitoring and post-construction evaluation.

Abstract: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is constantly evolving to meet the demand for sustainable and effective design and construction of the built environment. In the literature, two primary deposition techniques for large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP) have been described, namely extrusion-based (Contour Crafting-CC) and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP) methods. The deposition methods use a digitally controlled nozzle to print material layer by layer. The continuous flow of concrete material used to create the printed structure is called a filament or layer. As these filaments are the essential structure defining the printed object, the filaments' geometry quality control is crucial. This paper presents an automated procedure for quality control (QC) of filaments in extrusion-based and SC3DP printing methods. The paper also describes a workflow that is independent of the sensor used for data acquisition, such as a camera, a structured light system (SLS) or a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This method can be used with materials in either the fresh or cured state. Thus, it can be used for online and post-printing QC.

TL;DR: CoAtNet-Tiny outperforms VGG16 and ViT-B/16 in classifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls using actigraphy-derived images, showing higher accuracy and stability across folds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different image-based deep learning methods (VGG16, ViT-B/16, CoAtNet-Tiny) for identifying mental health conditions (depression, schizophrenia, healthy controls) from daily actigraphy records converted to images.

Method: Converted wrist-worn activity signals from Psykose and Depresjon datasets into 30×48 images, evaluated three models (VGG16, ViT-B/16, CoAtNet-Tiny) using three-fold subject-wise cross-validation.

Result: CoAtNet-Tiny achieved highest average accuracy and most stable performance across folds, with strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, especially for underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. VGG16 showed steady improvement but lower accuracy, while ViT-B/16 had variable performance across folds.

Conclusion: CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on actigraphy images, suggesting hybrid CNN-transformer designs may be particularly suitable for mental health classification using actigraphy-derived images.

Abstract: This work examines how three different image-based methods, VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny, perform in identifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls using daily actigraphy records. Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT combines deep learning and classical ML to detect and grade PV panel surface faults using only visible-light images, eliminating need for expensive multi-modal sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal imaging approaches for solar PV fault detection are logistically and economically challenging for routine deployment, especially for resource-limited installations. There's a need for affordable, scalable solutions using only visible band imagery.

Method: TinyViT pipeline integrates Transformer-based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression to process consumer-grade color camera images, classify seven nuanced surface faults, and generate severity grades for maintenance triage.

Result: The system achieves competitive accuracy and interpretability on real-world datasets for both classification and regression tasks, validating the approach without relying on electroluminescence or IR sensors.

Conclusion: The method enables affordable, scalable solar health monitoring with universal field accessibility by using only visible imagery, advancing the state of solar PV maintenance for resource-limited installations.

Abstract: Sustained operation of solar photovoltaic assets hinges on accurate detection and prioritization of surface faults across vast, geographically distributed modules. While multi modal imaging strategies are popular, they introduce logistical and economic barriers for routine farm level deployment. This work demonstrates that deep learning and classical machine learning may be judiciously combined to achieve robust surface anomaly categorization and severity estimation from planar visible band imagery alone. We introduce TinyViT which is a compact pipeline integrating Transformer based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression. The system ingests consumer grade color camera mosaics of PV panels, classifies seven nuanced surface faults, and generates actionable severity grades for maintenance triage. By eliminating reliance on electroluminescence or IR sensors, our method enables affordable, scalable upkeep for resource limited installations, and advances the state of solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility. Experiments on real public world datasets validate both classification and regression sub modules, achieving accuracy and interpretability competitive with specialized approaches.

*Ruo-Syuan Mei,Sixian Jia,Guangze Li,Soo Yeon Lee,Brian Musser,William Keller,Sreten Zakula,Jorge Arinez,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid synthetic data generation framework enables zero-shot learning for industrial quality inspection without manual annotation, achieving high detection and classification accuracy on real parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world manufacturing faces data constraints: expensive labeled data collection, rare defective samples causing class imbalance, and limited adoption of ML-based quality inspection due to these challenges.

Method: Hybrid SDG framework combining simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing. Two-stage architecture with YOLOv8n for detection and MobileNetV3-small for classification trained exclusively on synthetic data.

Result: Achieves mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, 90.1% balanced accuracy on 300 real industrial parts. Outperforms few-shot baselines (90-91% vs 50% accuracy under severe imbalance).

Conclusion: The proposed SDG-based approach enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing, demonstrating practical viability for industrial applications.

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is transforming industrial quality inspection. Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.

### [20] [Analysis of Incursive Breast Cancer in Mammograms Using YOLO, Explainability, and Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00129)
*Jayan Adhikari,Prativa Joshi,Susish Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning breast cancer detection systems fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs like other imaging modalities. This paper integrates ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures to reject non-mammographic images before detection, achieving 99.77% OOD accuracy and high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammograms are unreliable when presented with OOD inputs like CT, MRI, or X-ray images from different equipment, leading to misdiagnosis and false alarms. There's a need for robust systems that can handle diverse clinical data.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: 1) ResNet50-based OOD filtering using cosine similarity to create an in-domain gallery that rigidly rejects non-mammographic inputs before processing, 2) YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for breast cancer detection. ResNet50 was selected after evaluating 12 CNN architectures.

Result: OOD detection achieves 99.77% general accuracy with 100% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. The joint framework achieves high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. OOD filtering prevents false alarms on OOD inputs while maintaining high accuracy on mammographic data.

Conclusion: The integrated OOD filtering and detection framework provides a fundamental foundation for deploying reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity, addressing the critical reliability problem of current models when faced with out-of-distribution inputs.

Abstract: Deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammographic images have significant reliability problems when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs such as other imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray) or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and misdiagnosis. The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data. The present study offers a fundamental foundation for the deployment of reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity.

*Fadi Dornaika,Danyang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGCOAMix is a novel CutMix-based data augmentation method that uses superpixel attention and grid blending to better preserve local discriminative features and object parts, outperforming existing methods on classification and weakly supervised object location tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CutMix methods focus too much on global semantics, losing discriminative local context and object part information. They also suffer from inefficiency due to double forward propagation or reliance on pre-trained networks for label consistency.

Method: Proposes LGCOAMix, a superpixel-based grid blending method that uses superpixel attention to learn local features from discriminative regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts, efficiently handling label mixing without external networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art CutMix methods on various benchmark datasets for classification tasks and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011, effective for both CNN and Transformer networks.

Conclusion: LGCOAMix successfully addresses limitations of existing CutMix methods by preserving local discriminative features and object parts through superpixel attention, offering an efficient and effective data augmentation approach.

Abstract: Cutmix-based data augmentation, which uses a cut-and-paste strategy, has shown remarkable generalization capabilities in deep learning. However, existing methods primarily consider global semantics with image-level constraints, which excessively reduces attention to the discriminative local context of the class and leads to a performance improvement bottleneck. Moreover, existing methods for generating augmented samples usually involve cutting and pasting rectangular or square regions, resulting in a loss of object part information. To mitigate the problem of inconsistency between the augmented image and the generated mixed label, existing methods usually require double forward propagation or rely on an external pre-trained network for object centering, which is inefficient. To overcome the above limitations, we propose LGCOAMix, an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method for data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a label mixing strategy using a superpixel attention approach has been proposed for cutmix-based data augmentation. It is the first instance of learning local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that LGCOAMix outperforms state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks, {and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011.} We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LGCOAMix not only for CNN networks, but also for Transformer networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN for laser speckle material recognition achieves 95% accuracy on 59 material classes with 70x fewer parameters than ResNet-50, enabling edge deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe laser cutting to prevent poor cuts, machine damage, or hazardous fumes. Existing speckle-based methods use computationally expensive networks or handle limited material subsets.

Method: Proposed a lightweight convolutional neural network specifically designed for speckle patterns, minimizing parameters while maintaining discriminative power. Tested on complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes.

Result: Achieved 95.05% test accuracy with 0.951 F1-scores using only 341k parameters (~1.3 MB). Outperforms ResNet-50 with 70x fewer parameters, runs at 295 images/sec, enabling Raspberry Pi/Jetson deployment. Material family grouping yields 98-100% recall.

Conclusion: Compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbone networks for speckle-based material classification, advancing material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

Abstract: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe and effective laser cutting, as misidentification can lead to poor cut quality, machine damage, or the release of hazardous fumes. Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

TL;DR: ICVision is an AI system that uses vision-language models to classify EEG ICA components by interpreting dashboard visualizations like experts do, achieving better performance than conventional classifiers while providing explainable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG ICA component classifiers rely on handcrafted features and lack the visual reasoning capabilities that human experts use when interpreting EEG data. There's a need for AI systems that can see and reason about neurophysiological data like trained neurologists.

Method: ICVision uses GPT-4 Vision to directly interpret ICA dashboard visualizations (topography, time series, power spectra, ERP plots) and classify components into six categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, other noise). It provides both confidence scores and human-like explanations.

Result: Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel. Over 97% of outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by experts, and it preserved clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: ICVision represents a paradigm shift toward AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in neurophysiology, enabling globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows. It's part of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform.

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene understanding datasets lack rich semantic annotations needed for nuanced visual-language tasks, limiting their utility for real-world AI assistance applications.

Method: Automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal LLMs to generate dense captions for scene elements, plus scenario-based question generation integrating object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context.

Result: Significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines.

Conclusion: DenseScan bridges geometric detail with semantic richness, broadening downstream task capabilities and catalyzing new research avenues in 3D scene understanding for robotics, AR, and real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D understanding is a key capability for real-world AI assistance. High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond.

TL;DR: RHC enables free-view rendering and relighting of dynamic humans from sparse RGB videos using a transformer-based network that predicts relit appearance in a single pass, avoiding costly OLAT capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical OLAT-based human relighting requires capturing multiple lighting conditions which is time-consuming and impractical for dynamic humans. There's a need for efficient single-pass relighting that works with sparse-view video input.

Method: Uses transformer-based RelightNet with physics-informed features (geometry, albedo, shading, camera view) from coarse mesh proxy. Trained on multi-view lightstage data with alternating random environment maps and uniformly lit frames. Predicts relit appearance as texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to mesh.

Result: Superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Enables free-view rendering and relighting of full-body dynamic humans from sparse-view RGB videos.

Conclusion: RHC provides an efficient single-pass solution for human relighting that learns to compute the rendering equation implicitly, overcoming limitations of traditional OLAT-based methods while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: We present Relightable Holoported Characters (RHC), a novel person-specific method for free-view rendering and relighting of full-body and highly dynamic humans solely observed from sparse-view RGB videos at inference. In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/RHC/

*Yuzhen Hu,Saurabh Prasad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDiff adapts ImageNet-pretrained diffusion models to multiple remote sensing modalities (HSI, SAR) with minimal labeled data using parameter-efficient adaptation and pseudo-RGB anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse annotations constrain multimodal remote sensing applications; existing supervised methods like MSFMamba are limited by labeled data availability, while adapting ImageNet-pretrained models to heterogeneous modalities without large datasets remains challenging.

Method: UniDiff framework adapts single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model using FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation (~5% parameters), and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Demonstrated on two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets, showing that unsupervised adaptation effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

Conclusion: UniDiff enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations by adapting pre-trained diffusion models to multiple sensing modalities with minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: Sparse annotations fundamentally constrain multimodal remote sensing: even recent state-of-the-art supervised methods such as MSFMamba are limited by the availability of labeled data, restricting their practical deployment despite architectural advances. ImageNet-pretrained models provide rich visual representations, but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without large labeled datasets remains challenging. We propose UniDiff, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts a single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data. UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of approximately 5% of parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. This design enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations. Our results with two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that unsupervised adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cine MRI only provides 2D slice images, limiting comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiology in both healthy and pathological conditions. Need for 3D reconstruction from 2D data.

Method: HeartFormer: Multi-class point cloud completion network with two key components: 1) Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) for initial coarse point cloud with global and substructure features, and 2) Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet) for progressive refinement using semantic-geometry representations.

Result: Creates HeartCompv1 dataset (17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes/point-clouds). Extensive experiments show HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, generalizable performance, consistently surpassing SOTA methods on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank datasets.

Conclusion: HeartFormer provides first geometric deep learning framework for 3D cardiac reconstruction from cine MRI, addressing limitations of 2D imaging with novel multi-class point cloud completion approach and establishing benchmark dataset for the field.

Abstract: We present the first geometric deep learning framework based on point cloud representation for 3D four-chamber cardiac reconstruction from cine MRI data. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in conventional cine MRI, which typically provides only 2D slice images of the heart, thereby restricting a comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{HeartFormer}, a novel point cloud completion network that extends traditional single-class point cloud completion to the multi-class. HeartFormer consists of two key components: a Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) and a Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet). SA-DSTNet generates an initial coarse point cloud with both global geometry features and substructure geometry features. Guided by these semantic-geometry representations, SA-GFRTNet progressively refines the coarse output, effectively leveraging both global and substructure geometric priors to produce high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reconstructions. We further construct \textbf{HeartCompv1}, the first publicly available large-scale dataset with 17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes and point-clouds, to establish a general benchmark for this emerging research direction. Extensive cross-domain experiments on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank demonstrate that HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Jun Wang,Peirong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USB is the first unified framework for bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images using paired diffusion modeling and consistency guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paired pathological-healthy brain data is extremely scarce due to clinical constraints, limiting existing methods to domain-specific approaches that treat pathological and healthy image modeling separately rather than understanding their relationship.

Method: USB uses an end-to-end framework with paired diffusion mechanism to model joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy, plus consistency guidance algorithm to preserve anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional editing.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets (healthy controls, stroke, Alzheimer's patients) demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic pathological and healthy brain images.

Conclusion: USB establishes the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, enabling scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis by bridging pathological and healthy brain modeling.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between pathological and healthy brain structures is fundamental to neuroimaging, connecting disease diagnosis and detection with modeling, prediction, and treatment planning. However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing applications like disaster detection require real-time efficiency and lightweight models, but existing super-resolution methods struggle to balance performance with computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes HIMOSA framework with content-aware sparse attention mechanism to leverage inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery, plus hierarchical window expansion to exploit multi-scale repetitive patterns while reducing computational complexity through attention sparsity adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets show state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HIMOSA effectively addresses the performance-efficiency trade-off in remote sensing image super-resolution through innovative sparse attention and hierarchical processing techniques.

Abstract: In remote sensing applications, such as disaster detection and response, real-time efficiency and model lightweighting are of critical importance. Consequently, existing remote sensing image super-resolution methods often face a trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery, named HIMOSA. Specifically, HIMOSA leverages the inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery and introduces a content-aware sparse attention mechanism, enabling the model to achieve fast inference while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Furthermore, to effectively leverage the multi-scale repetitive patterns found in remote sensing imagery, we introduce a hierarchical window expansion and reduce the computational complexity by adjusting the sparsity of the attention. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AI system for lung cancer screening that detects and diagnoses malignancy at nodule level on CT scans, outperforming radiologists and existing AI models with high accuracy and low false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lung cancer screening depends on nodule size and growth monitoring, which inherently delays diagnosis. There's a need for more immediate and accurate malignancy assessment at the nodule level.

Method: Developed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models trained on 25,709 CT scans with 69,449 annotated nodules to perform both detection and malignancy diagnosis.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on independent cohort, with 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3% sensitivity. Outperformed radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models across all nodule sizes and stages.

Conclusion: The AI system addresses key barriers to AI adoption in lung cancer screening by providing earlier and more accurate diagnosis than current methods, particularly excelling in early-stage cancers and slow-growing nodules.

Abstract: Early detection of malignant lung nodules is critical, but its dependence on size and growth in screening inherently delays diagnosis. We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AR systems are limited by fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, unable to handle complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries for spatial understanding and relational reasoning in physical environments.

Method: A modular AR agent system with adaptive task coordination between MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools, dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations, task-adaptive region highlighting, and contextual spatial retrieval with human-in-the-loop refinement.

Result: The system enables meter-accurate 3D anchor retrieval, supports varying query complexities from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, and provides plug-and-use architecture for vision-language models without retraining.

Conclusion: The modular AR agent establishes AR systems as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding, supported by the introduced GroundedAR-Bench evaluation framework.

Abstract: Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.

TL;DR: TGSFormer: A scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion that maintains persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction without image coherence or frame caches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based methods for embodied SSC rely on random initialization within predefined bounds, causing redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Depth-guided approaches remain local and suffer from latency/memory overhead as scale increases.

Method: TGSFormer maintains persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction. Uses Dual Temporal Encoder with confidence-aware cross-attention to process current/historical Gaussian features, and Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module to merge overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations while regulating density.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity.

Conclusion: TGSFormer provides an effective solution for scalable embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion that overcomes redundancy and scalability limitations of existing Gaussian-based methods through temporal persistence and compact representation.

Abstract: Embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) infers dense geometry and semantics from continuous egocentric observations. Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset distillation reformulated as Optimal Transport distance minimization for fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels, achieving 4%+ accuracy improvements on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on matching global statistics but overlook instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. There's a need for methods that preserve fine-grained distributional geometry.

Method: Reformulates dataset distillation as Optimal Transport distance minimization with three components: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling for latent distribution alignment, (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling for adaptive label distributions, and (3) OT-based logit matching for output alignment with soft-label distributions.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: Optimal Transport provides a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching that effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations, enabling superior dataset distillation performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a compact distilled dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset. Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic anomaly methods produce visually distinct anomalies that ignore anatomical structure, limiting their realism and effectiveness for training anomaly detection models.

Method: Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation, followed by Anatomy-aware Realistic Texture-based Anomaly Synthesis (ART-ASyn) framework that generates anatomically consistent lung opacity anomalies using texture-based augmentation.

Result: Generates paired samples with synthetic anomalies and precise pixel-level masks, enabling explicit segmentation supervision. Demonstrates generalizability through zero-shot anomaly segmentation on unseen datasets without target-domain annotations.

Conclusion: ART-ASyn provides a novel framework for generating realistic, anatomically consistent anomalies that enables effective training for anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, with demonstrated generalizability to unseen datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies without pixel-level annotations. Synthetic anomaly-based methods exhibit a unique capacity to introduce controllable irregularities with known masks, enabling explicit supervision during training. However, existing methods often produce synthetic anomalies that are visually distinct from real pathological patterns and ignore anatomical structure. This paper presents a novel Anatomy-aware Realistic Texture-based Anomaly Synthesis framework (ART-ASyn) for chest X-rays that generates realistic and anatomically consistent lung opacity related anomalies using texture-based augmentation guided by our proposed Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation method (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation. The generated paired samples of synthetic anomalies and their corresponding precise pixel-level anomaly mask for each normal sample enable explicit segmentation supervision. In contrast to prior work limited to one-class classification, ART-ASyn is further evaluated for zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating generalizability on an unseen dataset without target-domain annotations.

*Chenqi Zhu,Levi Burner,Yiannis Aloimonos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel visual odometry method using ruled surfaces from line features instead of point correspondences, enhanced with IMU constraints for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual odometry relies on costly and error-prone point-to-point feature correspondences. Even alternative approaches using line features or sensor fusion still heavily depend on correspondence, which limits performance and accuracy.

Method: Uses ruled surfaces formed by straight lines sweeping through image-space time as camera moves. Instead of point correspondences, employs point-to-line associations with differential updates. Combines with IMU measurements to constrain solution space dimensionality. Inspired by event cameras' edge detection capabilities.

Result: Presents a novel algorithm that reconstructs 3D scenes and estimates visual odometry from ruled surfaces, reducing computational cost and correspondence-related errors while improving accuracy through IMU constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional correspondence-based methods by leveraging geometric properties of ruled surfaces and sensor fusion, potentially enabling more robust visual odometry systems.

Abstract: Visual odometry techniques typically rely on feature extraction from a sequence of images and subsequent computation of optical flow. This point-to-point correspondence between two consecutive frames can be costly to compute and suffers from varying accuracy, which affects the odometry estimate's quality. Attempts have been made to bypass the difficulties originating from the correspondence problem by adopting line features and fusing other sensors (event camera, IMU) to improve performance, many of which still heavily rely on correspondence. If the camera observes a straight line as it moves, the image of the line sweeps a smooth surface in image-space time. It is a ruled surface and analyzing its shape gives information about odometry. Further, its estimation requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Inspired by event cameras' propensity for edge detection, this research presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct 3D scenes and visual odometry from these ruled surfaces. By constraining the surfaces with the inertia measurements from an onboard IMU sensor, the dimensionality of the solution space is greatly reduced.

Method: Created MVAD dataset with three key characteristics: genuine multimodality with three realistic video-audio forgery patterns, high perceptual quality using diverse state-of-the-art generative models, and comprehensive diversity spanning realistic/anime styles, four content categories, and four multimodal data types.

Result: MVAD dataset is introduced as the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content, addressing critical gaps in existing resources.

Conclusion: MVAD bridges a critical gap in multimodal AI-generated content detection by providing a comprehensive dataset that will facilitate the development of more effective and trustworthy detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated multimodal video-audio content has raised significant concerns regarding information security and content authenticity. Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

*Zhongqi Wang,Jie Zhang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMDET is a novel model-level detection framework that identifies backdoors in vision-language pretrained models without requiring prior knowledge of triggers, targets, or training data, achieving 89.90% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor detection methods for VLPs like CLIP require impractical prior knowledge (training data, triggers, targets, or downstream classifiers), making real-world deployment challenging.

Method: Leverages feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders where all token representations show high similarity due to attention concentration on trigger tokens. Uses gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that activate backdoor behaviors, and filters out natural backdoor features by analyzing loss landscapes.

Result: Achieves 89.90% F1 score on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models across two attack paradigms and three VLP structures. Detects backdoors in ~5 minutes on RTX 4090 GPU and shows strong robustness against adaptive attacks. Also identifies natural backdoor features in OpenAI's official CLIP model.

Conclusion: AMDET provides an effective, practical solution for backdoor detection in VLPs without requiring prior knowledge, addressing a critical security challenge in real-world deployment of vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models (VLPs) such as CLIP have achieved remarkable success, but are also highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Given a model fine-tuned by an untrusted third party, determining whether the model has been injected with a backdoor is a critical and challenging problem. Existing detection methods usually rely on prior knowledge of training dataset, backdoor triggers and targets, or downstream classifiers, which may be impractical for real-world applications. To address this, To address this challenge, we introduce Assimilation Matters in DETection (AMDET), a novel model-level detection framework that operates without any such prior knowledge. Specifically, we first reveal the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders: the representations of all tokens within a backdoor sample exhibit a high similarity. Further analysis attributes this effect to the concentration of attention weights on the trigger token. Leveraging this insight, AMDET scans a model by performing gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that capable of activating backdoor behaviors. Furthermore, we identify the natural backdoor feature in the OpenAI's official CLIP model, which are not intentionally injected but still exhibit backdoor-like behaviors. We then filter them out from real injected backdoor by analyzing their loss landscapes. Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP model structures show that AMDET detects backdoors with an F1 score of 89.90%. Besides, it achieves one complete detection in approximately 5 minutes on a RTX 4090 GPU and exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D cameras for human motion prediction are sensitive to lighting and raise privacy concerns, limiting real-world applications. Millimeter-wave radar offers robustness and privacy but suffers from noisy measurements due to specular reflections and multipath effects.

Method: Proposes mmPred, a diffusion-based framework with dual-domain historical motion representation: Time-domain Pose Refinement branch for fine details and Frequency-domain Dominant Motion branch for global trends. Uses Global Skeleton-relational Transformer as diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation.

Conclusion: mmPred successfully addresses radar-specific artifacts in human motion prediction, demonstrating the viability of radar as a robust, privacy-preserving sensing modality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Existing Human Motion Prediction (HMP) methods based on RGB-D cameras are sensitive to lighting conditions and raise privacy concerns, limiting their real-world applications such as firefighting and healthcare. Motivated by the robustness and privacy-preserving nature of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, this work introduces radar as a novel sensing modality for HMP, for the first time. Nevertheless, radar signals often suffer from specular reflections and multipath effects, resulting in noisy and temporally inconsistent measurements, such as body-part miss-detection. To address these radar-specific artifacts, we propose mmPred, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for radar-based HMP. mmPred introduces a dual-domain historical motion representation to guide the generation process, combining a Time-domain Pose Refinement (TPR) branch for learning fine-grained details and a Frequency-domain Dominant Motion (FDM) branch for capturing global motion trends and suppressing frame-level inconsistency. Furthermore, we design a Global Skeleton-relational Transformer (GST) as the diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation, enabling corrupted joints to dynamically aggregate information from others. Extensive experiments show that mmPred achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 8.6% on mmBody and 22% on mm-Fi.

### [41] [SMamDiff: Spatial Mamba for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00355)
*Junqiao Fan,Pengfei Liu,Haocong Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMamDiff: A single-stage diffusion model for human motion prediction that ensures spatial-temporal coherence using residual-DCT motion encoding and stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module, achieving SOTA results with lower latency/memory than multi-stage baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion prediction methods either produce deterministic forecasts ignoring uncertainty or use probabilistic models sacrificing kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve accuracy-diversity trade-off but rely on costly multi-stage pipelines unsuitable for edge deployment. Need for single-stage diffusion model that ensures spatial-temporal coherence.

Method: SMamDiff introduces two novel designs: 1) Residual-DCT motion encoding subtracts last observed pose before temporal DCT to reduce DC component dominance and highlight higher-frequency cues, focusing on how joints move rather than where they are. 2) Stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module processes joints in ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods on Human3.6M and HumanEva datasets while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed coherence mechanisms in SMamDiff enable effective single-stage diffusion modeling for human motion prediction, balancing accuracy and diversity while being more efficient for edge deployment compared to multi-stage approaches.

Abstract: With intelligent room-side sensing and service robots widely deployed, human motion prediction (HMP) is essential for safe, proactive assistance. However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.

### [42] [MM-DETR: An Efficient Multimodal Detection Transformer with Mamba-Driven Dual-Granularity Fusion and Frequency-Aware Modality Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00363)
*Jianhong Han,Yupei Wang,Yuan Zhang,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-DETR: A lightweight multimodal object detection framework using Mamba-based fusion with channel-wise dynamic gating and 1D selective scanning for efficient cross-modal interaction, plus modality completion and frequency-aware adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal object detection methods struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks are complex, shared backbones yield suboptimal modality-specific features, and dual-stream architectures double parameters, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Proposes MM-DETR with: 1) Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder using channel-wise dynamic gating and 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling; 2) Region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch for modality completion; 3) Lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter with spatial-frequency co-expert structure and pixel-wise router for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and generalization capability.

Conclusion: MM-DETR provides a lightweight and efficient solution for multimodal object detection that balances performance with practical deployment requirements through innovative fusion and adaptation mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing object detection aims to achieve more accurate and robust perception under challenging conditions by fusing complementary information from different modalities. However, existing approaches that rely on attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks still struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Beyond fusion complexity, extracting modality features with shared backbones yields suboptimal representations due to insufficient modality-specific modeling, whereas dual-stream architectures nearly double the parameter count, ultimately limiting practical deployment. To this end, we propose MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection. Specifically, we propose a Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder that reformulates global interaction as channel-wise dynamic gating and leverages a 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling with linear complexity. Following this design, we further reinterpret multimodal fusion as a modality completion problem. A region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch is introduced to recover modality-specific cues, supporting fine-grained fusion along a bidirectional pyramid pathway with minimal overhead. To further reduce parameter redundancy while retaining strong feature extraction capability, a lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter is inserted into the shared backbone. This adapter employs a spatial-frequency co-expert structure to capture modality-specific cues, while a pixel-wise router dynamically balances expert contributions for efficient spatial-frequency fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smaller segmentation models develop human-like coarse body representations, while larger models create overly detailed encodings, suggesting coarse representations emerge under limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether vision models trained for segmentation develop internal representations similar to human coarse body representations used for physical reasoning, and to explore how model size affects these representations.

Method: Adapted a psychophysical experiment with 50 human participants to a semantic segmentation task, testing seven segmentation networks of varying sizes to analyze their internal representations.

Result: Smaller models naturally form human-like coarse body representations, while larger models tend toward overly detailed, fine-grain encodings.

Conclusion: Coarse representations emerge under limited computational resources, and machine representations can provide a scalable approach to understanding physical reasoning in the brain.

Abstract: Human physical reasoning relies on internal "body" representations - coarse, volumetric approximations that capture an object's extent and support intuitive predictions about motion and physics. While psychophysical evidence suggests humans use such coarse representations, their internal structure remains largely unknown. Here we test whether vision models trained for segmentation develop comparable representations. We adapt a psychophysical experiment conducted with 50 human participants to a semantic segmentation task and test a family of seven segmentation networks, varying in size. We find that smaller models naturally form human-like coarse body representations, whereas larger models tend toward overly detailed, fine-grain encodings. Our results demonstrate that coarse representations can emerge under limited computational resources, and that machine representations can provide a scalable path toward understanding the structure of physical reasoning in the brain.

### [44] [THCRL: Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00368)
*Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THCRL is a novel trusted hierarchical contrastive representation learning method for multi-view clustering that addresses untrustworthy fusion through denoising mechanisms and neighbor-aware contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods suffer from untrustworthy fusion due to two main issues: 1) ignoring inherent noise within individual views, and 2) traditional contrastive learning methods focus only on same-instance cross-view similarity while neglecting structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster.

Method: THCRL consists of two key modules: 1) Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) uses UNet architecture with multiple denoising mechanisms for trustworthy multi-view fusion, and 2) Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) aligns fused representation with view-specific representation by enhancing similarity among samples in the same cluster rather than just same samples across views.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: THCRL effectively addresses the untrustworthy fusion problem in multi-view clustering through hierarchical denoising fusion and neighbor-aware contrastive learning, leading to superior clustering performance.

Abstract: Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years. It is capable of partitioning data samples into distinct groups by learning a consensus representation. However, a significant challenge remains: the problem of untrustworthy fusion. This problem primarily arises from two key factors: 1) Existing methods often ignore the presence of inherent noise within individual views; 2) In traditional MVC methods using Contrastive Learning (CL), similarity computations typically rely on different views of the same instance, while neglecting the structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster. Consequently, this leads to the wrong direction for multi-view fusion. To address this problem, we present a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL). It consists of two key modules. Specifically, we propose the Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module, which leverages the UNet architecture integrated with multiple denoising mechanisms to achieve trustworthy fusion of multi-view data. Furthermore, we present the Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. Unlike conventional strategies, AKCL enhances representation similarity among samples belonging to the same cluster, rather than merely focusing on the same sample across views, thereby reinforcing the confidence of the fused representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in deep MVC tasks.

### [45] [POLARIS: Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00369)
*Wenshuo Chen,Haosen Li,Shaofeng Liang,Lei Wang,Haozhe Jia,Kaishen Yuan,Jieming Wu,Bowen Tian,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POLARIS improves diffusion model inversion by treating guidance scale as step-wise variable to minimize noise approximation errors, boosting reconstruction quality with minimal code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Inversion-Denoising Paradigm suffers from reconstruction degradation due to approximate noise error accumulation, where noise at step t is approximated with prediction at step t-1, causing severe error buildup throughout inversion.

Method: POLARIS reformulates inversion as an error-origin problem rather than error-compensation, treats guidance scale ω as step-wise variable, and derives mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step.

Result: POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code, has negligible performance overhead, substantially mitigates noise approximation errors, and consistently improves downstream task accuracy.

Conclusion: POLARIS provides an efficient, mathematically grounded solution to the critical noise approximation error problem in diffusion model inversion, significantly enhancing reconstruction quality with minimal implementation complexity.

Abstract: The Inversion-Denoising Paradigm, which is based on diffusion models, excels in diverse image editing and restoration tasks. We revisit its mechanism and reveal a critical, overlooked factor in reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. This error stems from approximating the noise at step t with the prediction at step t-1, resulting in severe error accumulation throughout the inversion process. We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem. Rather than optimizing embeddings or latent codes to offset accumulated drift, POLARIS treats the guidance scale ω as a step-wise variable and derives a mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step. Remarkably, POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code. With negligible performance overhead, it substantially mitigates noise approximation errors and consistently improves the accuracy of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: PorePatch dataset addresses facial weak-texture matching challenges with pore-scale patches, enabling deep learning descriptor training that outperforms traditional methods in matching but shows limited advantage in 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial skin's weak-texture nature challenges local descriptor matching for facial motion analysis and 3D reconstruction. Deep learning descriptors show promise but lack pore-scale datasets for facial domain development.

Method: Proposed PorePatch dataset with Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate high-quality pore-scale image patches from high-resolution facial images. Trained existing SOTA models on this dataset and established evaluation benchmarks.

Result: SOTA model achieved FPR95 of 1.91% on matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by 20.5%. However, in 3D reconstruction task, its advantage diminished with no significant improvement over traditional descriptors.

Conclusion: Deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing facial weak-texture challenges despite improved matching performance. More work needed to bridge gap between matching and reconstruction tasks in facial domain.

Abstract: The weak-texture nature of facial skin regions presents significant challenges for local descriptor matching in applications such as facial motion analysis and 3D face reconstruction. Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.

Conclusion: EZ-SP enables efficient real-time 3D semantic segmentation with dramatic speed and parameter reductions while maintaining accuracy across diverse domains.

Abstract: Superpoint-based pipelines provide an efficient alternative to point- or voxel-based 3D semantic segmentation, but are often bottlenecked by their CPU-bound partition step. We propose a learnable, fully GPU partitioning algorithm that generates geometrically and semantically coherent superpoints 13$\times$ faster than prior methods. Our module is compact (under 60k parameters), trains in under 20 minutes with a differentiable surrogate loss, and requires no handcrafted features. Combine with a lightweight superpoint classifier, the full pipeline fits in $<$2 MB of VRAM, scales to multi-million-point scenes, and supports real-time inference. With 72$\times$ faster inference and 120$\times$ fewer parameters, EZ-SP matches the accuracy of point-based SOTA models across three domains: indoor scans (S3DIS), autonomous driving (KITTI-360), and aerial LiDAR (DALES).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too narrow to holistically assess the advanced cognitive and creative capabilities of modern image editing models, which require comprehensive evaluation of knowledge-intensive reasoning and creative composition.

Method: WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded cognitive steps (Awareness, Interpretation, Imagination) and incorporates three knowledge types (Declarative, Procedural, Metacognitive). It includes 1,220 test cases with complex tasks that challenge models at each step.

Result: The benchmark objectively reveals limitations of state-of-the-art image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: WiseEdit provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing advanced image editing capabilities, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks and enabling better understanding of model limitations in cognitive and creative tasks.

Abstract: Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon. Project Page: https://qnancy.github.io/wiseedit_project_page/.

*Jiazhen Liu,Mingkuan Feng,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAMP introduces "all-mask prediction" to resolve the trilemma in MLLMs: preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs face a trilemma when integrating segmentation: they must compromise between dialogue ability, segmentation performance, and inference speed. Embedding prediction degrades dialogue, while next-token prediction forces trade-offs between poor segmentation or slow inference.

Method: STAMP uses "all-mask prediction" that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. After generating text, it predicts entire segmentation masks in one forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches.

Result: STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks while maintaining dialogue ability and achieving exceptional inference speed.

Conclusion: The all-mask prediction paradigm resolves the segmentation trilemma in MLLMs, enabling simultaneous excellence in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.

Abstract: Integrating segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents a core trilemma: simultaneously preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference. Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed. Extensive experiments show that STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, providing a solution that excels in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.

*Lingdong Wang,Guan-Ming Su,Divya Kothandaraman,Tsung-Wei Huang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Ramesh K. Sitaraman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSCo is a semantic video compression framework that transmits only key information (text, degraded video, optional sketches/poses) and uses generative AI to reconstruct high-quality videos, achieving 2-10X better perceptual quality at low bitrates compared to traditional codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs fail at ultra-low bitrates because they prioritize pixel fidelity over human perception, leading to severe artifacts. There's a need for compression methods that align with how humans actually perceive video content.

Method: Decomposes video into three compact modalities: textual description (semantics), spatiotemporally degraded video (appearance), and optional sketches/poses (motion). Uses conditional video diffusion model for reconstruction with temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs for improved generation and compactness.

Result: Outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates, demonstrating superior video quality reconstruction from minimal transmitted information.

Conclusion: Semantic compression with generative priors is more effective than traditional pixel-based approaches for ultra-low bitrate video compression, better aligning with human perception and enabling high-quality reconstruction from compact multimodal representations.

Abstract: Traditional video codecs optimized for pixel fidelity collapse at ultra-low bitrates and produce severe artifacts. This failure arises from a fundamental misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. We propose a semantic video compression framework named DiSCo that transmits only the most meaningful information while relying on generative priors for detail synthesis. The source video is decomposed into three compact modalities: a textual description, a spatiotemporally degraded video, and optional sketches or poses that respectively capture semantic, appearance, and motion cues. A conditional video diffusion model then reconstructs high-quality, temporally coherent videos from these compact representations. Temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs are proposed to improve multimodal generation and modality compactness. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFont3D: A novel 3D Gaussian splatting framework for generating 3D artistic fonts from text prompts with precise part-level style control, outperforming existing methods in consistency, quality, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D artistic font generation (3D-AFG) is underexplored despite its potential applications in immersive 3D environments and enhancement of 2D-AFG. 3D fonts have precise semantics with structural constraints and require fine-grained part-level style control, which existing methods don't adequately address.

Method: Proposes SplatFont3D using 3D Gaussian splatting: 1) Glyph2Cloud module enhances 2D glyphs and produces 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization, 2) 3D Gaussians optimized via score distillation sampling with pretrained 2D diffusion model, 3) Dynamic component assignment strategy partitions components using geometric priors to enable part-level control while preventing drift-induced entanglement.

Result: SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency. Provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF-based approaches with faster rendering.

Conclusion: SplatFont3D successfully addresses the challenges of 3D-AFG by enabling creation of 3D artistic fonts from text prompts with precise part-level style control, offering superior performance over existing methods while being more efficient for rendering.

Abstract: Artistic font generation (AFG) can assist human designers in creating innovative artistic fonts. However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.

*Yingxuan You,Chen Zhao,Hantao Zhang,Mingda Xu,Pascal Fua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-guided 3D shape generation pipeline that integrates physical properties (like aerodynamics) into generative models to enhance realism beyond visual plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape generation methods lack knowledge of physical properties that are crucial for engineering-designed shapes (e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for cars), limiting their realism for industrial design applications.

Method: Proposes a unified physics-based pipeline with flow matching model featuring explicit physical guidance. Uses alternating updates: velocity-based update with physics-aware regularization, followed by physics-based refinement. Builds SP-VAE (shape-and-physics variational autoencoder) to jointly encode shape and physics into unified latent space.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show improved shape realism beyond mere visual plausibility through synergistic integration of physical properties.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-guided approach successfully enhances 3D shape generation for industrial design by incorporating physical validity, moving beyond purely visual realism to functional realism.

Abstract: Existing generative models for 3D shapes can synthesize high-fidelity and visually plausible shapes. For certain classes of shapes that have undergone an engineering design process, the realism of the shape is tightly coupled with the underlying physical properties, e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for automobiles. Since existing methods lack knowledge of such physics, they are unable to use this knowledge to enhance the realism of shape generation. Motivated by this, we propose a unified physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline, with a focus on industrial design applications. Specifically, we introduce a new flow matching model with explicit physical guidance, consisting of an alternating update process. We iteratively perform a velocity-based update and a physics-based refinement, progressively adjusting the latent code to align with the desired 3D shapes and physical properties. We further strengthen physical validity by incorporating a physics-aware regularization term into the velocity-based update step. To support such physics-guided updates, we build a shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) that jointly encodes shape and physics information into a unified latent space. The experiments on three benchmarks show that this synergistic formulation improves shape realism beyond mere visual plausibility.

TL;DR: Computer vision pipeline using existing bus CCTV to estimate passenger flows in African transit, works well in ideal conditions but degrades under real-world stressors like overcrowding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated systems fail to capture reliable passenger flow data in overcrowded sub-Saharan African public transport, creating a need for alternative solutions using available infrastructure.

Method: Combines YOLOv12 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR-based timestamping, and telematics-based stop classification to recover bus origin-destination flows from existing onboard CCTV.

Result: High accuracy under ideal conditions (95% recall, 91% precision, 93% F1) with OD matrices matching manual tallies, but performance degrades sharply under real-world stressors like overcrowding (40% undercount) and monochrome video (17% recall drop).

Conclusion: The baseline pipeline shows promise but reveals deployment-specific failure modes, motivating the need for more robust, deployment-focused Re-ID methods tailored to sub-Saharan African transit conditions.

Abstract: Public transport in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often operates in overcrowded conditions where existing automated systems fail to capture reliable passenger flow data. Leveraging onboard CCTV already deployed for security, we present a baseline pipeline that combines YOLOv12 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR-based timestamping, and telematics-based stop classification to recover bus origin--destination (OD) flows. On annotated CCTV segments from Nairobi and Kigali buses, the system attains high counting accuracy under low-density, well-lit conditions (recall $\approx$95\%, precision $\approx$91\%, F1 $\approx$93\%). It produces OD matrices that closely match manual tallies. Under realistic stressors such as overcrowding, color-to-monochrome shifts, posture variation, and non-standard door use, performance degrades sharply (e.g., $\sim$40\% undercount in peak-hour boarding and a $\sim$17 percentage-point drop in recall for monochrome segments), revealing deployment-specific failure modes and motivating more robust, deployment-focused Re-ID methods for SSA transit.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonRewards: A physics-grounded post-training framework using verifiable rewards (optical flow for velocity, appearance features for mass) to enforce Newtonian physics in video generation, improving physical plausibility across motion primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models produce visually compelling clips but often violate basic physical laws (objects float, inconsistent accelerations, unrealistic collisions), revealing a gap between visual realism and physical realism.

Method: Proposes NewtonRewards framework that extracts measurable proxies from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow as velocity proxy and appearance features as mass proxy. Enforces Newtonian structure through two rewards: Newtonian kinematic constraint for constant-acceleration dynamics and mass conservation reward to prevent degenerate solutions.

Result: Evaluated on NewtonBench-60K benchmark with five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, ramp sliding down/up). Consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior methods. Maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction.

Conclusion: Physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation, bridging the gap between visual and physical realism without relying on human or VLM feedback.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet often violate basic physical laws-objects float, accelerations drift, and collisions behave inconsistently-revealing a persistent gap between visual realism and physical realism. We propose $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on $\textit{verifiable rewards}$. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ extracts $\textit{measurable proxies}$ from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, $\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$. Across all primitives in visual and physics metrics, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior post-training methods. It further maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction. Our results show that physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation.

*Jiachuan Peng,Kyle Lam,Jianing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pneumonia classifier trained solely on synthetic chest X-ray images generated by Google's Nano Banana AI achieved strong performance on real-world datasets, demonstrating feasibility of synthetic data for medical AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of using synthetic medical imaging data generated by advanced AI models for training diagnostic classifiers, addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns in medical AI development.

Method: Trained a pneumonia classifier exclusively on synthetic chest X-ray images generated by Google's Nano Banana AI model, then evaluated on two real-world CXR datasets (RSNA Pneumonia Detection and Chest X-Ray datasets).

Result: The classifier achieved AUROC of 0.923 and AUPR of 0.900 on RSNA dataset (14,863 CXRs), and AUROC of 0.824 and AUPR of 0.913 on Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs), demonstrating strong performance despite being trained only on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical imaging data shows promise for AI development but requires careful prompt design, post-processing, validation, regulatory approval, and ethical oversight before clinical translation.

Abstract: We trained a classifier with synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images generated by Nano Banana, the latest AI model for image generation and editing, released by Google. When directly applied to real-world CXRs having only been trained with synthetic data, the classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.919 - 0.927), and an AUPR of 0.900 (95% CI: 0.894 - 0.907) in recognizing pneumonia in the 2018 RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset (14,863 CXRs), and an AUROC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.810 - 0.836), and an AUPR of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.904 - 0.922) in the Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs). These external validation results on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and suggest potential for synthetic data in medical AI development. Nonetheless, several limitations remain at present, including challenges in prompt design for controlling the diversity of synthetic CXR data and the requirement for post-processing to ensure alignment with real-world data. However, the growing sophistication and accessibility of medical intelligence will necessitate substantial validation, regulatory approval, and ethical oversight prior to clinical translation.

*Hang Xu,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FR-TTS introduces a filling-based reward method to enable effective test-time scaling for next-token prediction by estimating future trajectories of incomplete sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling works well for image generation but fails in next-token prediction due to low correlation between intermediate sequence rewards and final output rewards, making intermediate samples poor indicators for pruning decisions.

Method: Proposes Filling-Based Reward (FR) that estimates future trajectories by applying reasonable filling schemes to complete intermediate sequences, then develops FR-TTS with efficient filling scheme search and diversity reward with dynamic weighting.

Result: FR shows high correlation between intermediate and final sample rewards, and FR-TTS outperforms multiple established benchmarks and various reward models in experimental validation.

Conclusion: FR-TTS successfully enables test-time scaling for next-token prediction by solving the intermediate reward correlation problem through intelligent sequence completion and balanced evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has become a prevalent technique in image generation, significantly boosting output quality by expanding the number of parallel samples and filtering them using pre-trained reward models. However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

Motivation: Automated personality and soft skill assessment from multimodal behavioral data is challenging due to limited datasets and methods that fail to capture geometric structure inherent in human traits.

Method: Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF): geometric deep learning framework modeling behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds with geometry-specific expert networks and adaptive routing mechanism.

Conclusion: The RecruitView dataset and CRMF framework provide effective solutions for automated personality assessment by capturing geometric structures of human traits through multimodal behavioral data analysis.

Abstract: Automated personality and soft skill assessment from multimodal behavioral data remains challenging due to limited datasets and methods that fail to capture geometric structure inherent in human traits. We introduce RecruitView, a dataset of 2,011 naturalistic video interview clips from 300+ participants with 27,000 pairwise comparative judgments across 12 dimensions: Big Five personality traits, overall personality score, and six interview performance metrics. To leverage this data, we propose Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF), a geometric deep learning framework that explicitly models behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds. CRMF employs geometry-specific expert networks to capture hierarchical trait structures, directional behavioral patterns, and continuous performance variations simultaneously. An adaptive routing mechanism dynamically weights expert contributions based on input characteristics. Through principled tangent space fusion, CRMF achieves superior performance while training 40-50% fewer trainable parameters than large multimodal models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRMF substantially outperforms the selected baselines, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in Spearman correlation and 6.0% in concordance index.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalAffect is the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis, modeling AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level causal hierarchy with counterfactual interventions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring annotated datasets or handcrafted priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in facial affect analysis lack structured reasoning about latent dependencies between Action Units (AUs) and expressions, and rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations directly from data.

Method: CausalAffect uses a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy integrating population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures, plus a feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism to enforce true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations.

Result: The framework recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks in both AU detection and expression recognition.

Conclusion: CausalAffect establishes a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior analysis, advancing the field without requiring jointly annotated datasets or handcrafted causal priors.

Abstract: Understanding human affect from facial behavior requires not only accurate recognition but also structured reasoning over the latent dependencies that drive muscle activations and their expressive outcomes. Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior. All trained models and source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Junyan Ye,Leiqi Zhu,Yuncheng Guo,Dongzhi Jiang,Zilong Huang,Yifan Zhang,Zhiyuan Yan,Haohuan Fu,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealGen is a photorealistic text-to-image framework that uses LLM prompt optimization, diffusion models, and a novel "Detector Reward" mechanism to reduce AI artifacts and improve realism, outperforming existing models on photorealism metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advanced image generation models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image achieve good text-to-image consistency but still produce "fake" images with AI artifacts (overly smooth skin, oily facial sheens), failing to achieve the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation.

Method: RealGen integrates an LLM for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. It introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism that quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors, then uses GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline.

Result: RealGen significantly outperforms general models (GPT-Image-1, Qwen-Image) and specialized photorealistic models (FLUX-Krea) in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics. The proposed RealBench benchmark provides automated photorealism assessment that aligns well with real user experience.

Conclusion: RealGen successfully advances photorealistic text-to-image generation by addressing AI artifact issues through detector-based reward optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in photorealism while providing an effective automated evaluation framework.

Abstract: With the continuous advancement of image generation technology, advanced models such as GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image have achieved remarkable text-to-image consistency and world knowledge However, these models still fall short in photorealistic image generation. Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Context Learning with Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) for Generic Event Boundary Detection, achieving linear complexity and state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic Event Boundary Detection aims to identify moments in videos that humans perceive as event boundaries, but existing methods lack structured context and have computational limitations.

Method: Introduces Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide structured context for temporal models, calculates group similarities between frames, uses lightweight fully convolutional network for boundary detection, and applies Gaussian kernel preprocessing for ambiguous annotations.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets with better speed-accuracy trade-off and linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed Structured Context Learning with SPoS provides an effective, flexible, and efficient solution for Generic Event Boundary Detection that outperforms existing methods across multiple challenging datasets.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify moments in videos that humans perceive as event boundaries. This paper proposes a novel method for addressing this task, called Structured Context Learning, which introduces the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide a structured context for learning temporal information. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and flexible, not restricted to specific temporal models like GRU, LSTM, and Transformers. This flexibility enables our method to achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, we apply SPoS to partition the input frame sequence and provide a structured context for the subsequent temporal model. Notably, SPoS's overall computational complexity is linear with respect to the video length. We next calculate group similarities to capture differences between frames, and a lightweight fully convolutional network is utilized to determine the event boundaries based on the grouped similarity maps. To remedy the ambiguities of boundary annotations, we adapt the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TACS learns to select contextual examples that improve task performance rather than just similar ones, outperforming similarity-based retrieval across 18 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans resolve visual uncertainty by comparing images with relevant examples, but current ViTs lack the ability to identify which examples would actually improve their predictions. Similarity-based retrieval often selects examples that appear similar but don't necessarily help with the task.

Method: Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS) framework jointly trains a selector network with the task model through a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective.

Result: Across 18 datasets covering fine-grained recognition, medical image classification, and medical image segmentation, TACS consistently outperforms similarity-based retrieval, particularly in challenging or data-limited settings.

Conclusion: By aligning example selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help improve performance, moving beyond similarity-based approaches.

Abstract: Humans often resolve visual uncertainty by comparing an image with relevant examples, but ViTs lack the ability to identify which examples would improve their predictions.

TACS jointly trains a selector network with the task model through a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective. By aligning selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with coherent scene generation from single images - early methods don't generalize well, while recent large-scale 3D foundation models have issues with inaccurate object pose estimation and spatial inconsistency.

Method: Uses a hybrid instance generator combining semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation. Also employs a camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm to apply foundational pose estimation models for scene-level coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CC-FMO provides an effective zero-shot solution for single-image to 3D scene generation that addresses key challenges in object layout preservation, instance fidelity, and scene-level coherence.

Abstract: High-quality 3D scene generation from a single image is crucial for AR/VR and embodied AI applications. Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smartphone-based structured-light system uses 2D dynamic time warping to reconstruct uneven terrain from projected grid patterns for mobile rover stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost mobile rovers struggle with small terrain irregularities that are visually imperceptible but critical for locomotion stability, requiring a simple, resource-efficient sensing solution.

Method: Developed a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects grid patterns onto ground and uses topology-constrained 2D dynamic time warping algorithm for robust grid matching under perspective distortion and occlusion.

Result: Created a system simple enough for resource-limited platforms that preserves grid structure for accurate triangulation, enabling terrain sensing and general grid pattern matching applications.

Conclusion: The proposed 2D-DTW algorithm effectively addresses grid matching challenges for terrain reconstruction and has broader applications in image processing for structured grid pattern matching.

Abstract: Low-cost mobile rovers often operate on uneven terrain where small bumps or tilts are difficult to perceive visually but can significantly affect locomotion stability. To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios. This paper describes the overall system design as well as the 2D-DTW extension that emerged from this application.

Motivation: Existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, while image generation models trained on language-image corpora show strong compositionality and temporal coherence, suggesting potential for video-like robotic planning.

Method: A two-part framework using LoRA finetuning: (1) text-conditioned generation using language instruction and first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation using 2D trajectory overlay and initial frame.

Result: Experiments on Jaco Play, Bridge V2, and RT1 datasets show both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.

Conclusion: Pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional video diffusion models.

Abstract: Generating realistic robotic manipulation videos is an important step toward unifying perception, planning, and action in embodied agents. While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling.
  We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is challenging but crucial for applications like urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical preservation where dense scans are often unavailable. There's a need to update 3D scenes from sparse-view observations efficiently.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for pose estimation across timestamps, 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions, 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization that iteratively integrates historical prior information into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency. The method supports non-continuous capture, enabling scene updates with new sparse views and recovery of past scenes from limited data.

Conclusion: Cross-Temporal 3DGS is a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation, demonstrating the potential to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images that can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is a significant challenge in computer vision. Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios, creating a need for adaptive detection frameworks.

Method: Proposes SAIDO framework with two key components: Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies new scenes using VLLMs and allocates independent expert modules, and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM) that uses importance-guided gradient projection to balance plasticity and stability while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Outperforms current SOTA in continual learning tasks with 44.22% and 40.57% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate respectively, and improves average detection accuracy by 9.47% on open-world datasets.

Conclusion: SAIDO framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in AI-generated image detection through scene-aware dynamic expert allocation and importance-guided optimization, demonstrating superior performance in both continual learning and open-world scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread misuse of image generation technologies has raised security concerns, driving the development of AI-generated image detection methods. However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.

TL;DR: Hybrid approach combining 3D generative models, semantic-aware deformation, and Gaussian Splatting optimization for reconstructing dynamic multi-human, multi-object scenes from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are dynamic with complex human-object interactions, but 3D geometry modeling of such scenes remains challenging due to diverse motions, occlusions, and lack of methods for multi-human, multi-object scenarios in monocular setups.

Method: Three-part hybrid approach: 1) 3D generative models for high-fidelity meshes, 2) Semantic-aware deformation with rigid transformations for objects and LBS-based deformation for humans, 3) Gaussian Splatting optimization for refining element alignments in the scene.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HOI-M3 dataset (only dataset with multi-human, multi-object interactions), producing better surface reconstruction with maintained object structures under severe occlusion and multi-view temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses challenges of dynamic multi-human, multi-object scene reconstruction by combining generative models, semantic deformation, and GS optimization, enabling robust geometry modeling even under severe occlusions.

Abstract: Real-world human-built environments are highly dynamic, involving multiple humans and their complex interactions with surrounding objects. While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing better surface reconstruction of such scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroVolve is a generative framework that synthesizes images guided by neural activity patterns from brain regions, enabling both single-region and multi-region constraint optimization for personalized brain-driven image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on replicating category selectivity in isolated brain regions but offered limited insight into how regions interact during complex natural vision. There's a need to understand how distributed neural patterns combine to create representations and how brain regions interact during visual processing.

Method: NeuroVolve optimizes a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated by activating/deactivating single or multiple brain regions together, tracking optimization steps to reveal semantic trajectories through embedding space.

Result: Validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes satisfying complex multi-region constraints. Can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives including co-activation and decorrelation between regions.

Conclusion: NeuroVolve unifies brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation, captures subject-specific preferences for personalized brain-driven synthesis, and offers interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

Abstract: What visual information is encoded in individual brain regions, and how do distributed patterns combine to create their neural representations? Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

TL;DR: DAAAM is a real-time 4D scene understanding framework that builds hierarchical spatio-temporal scene graphs with detailed semantic descriptions while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between rich open-vocabulary descriptions and real-time performance when grounding descriptions in 3D. Applications like augmented reality and robot autonomy need both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding and semantic detail.

Method: Proposes DAAAM with an optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models using batch processing for speed. Builds hierarchical 4D scene graphs as globally consistent memory representations that interface with tool-calling agents.

Result: Achieves SOTA results: improves OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over baselines. Maintains real-time performance while producing detailed descriptions.

Conclusion: DAAAM successfully addresses the tradeoff between rich semantic descriptions and real-time performance, enabling effective 4D scene understanding for applications requiring spatio-temporal memory with both geometric and semantic detail.

Abstract: Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.
  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.

TL;DR: Yoga pose classification using skeleton representations outperforms raw images, with VGG16 + MediaPipe Pose achieving 96.09% accuracy on new Yoga-16 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Yoga's popularity brings injury risks from incorrect postures, creating need for automated classification to reduce reliance on experts. Existing work lacks systematic benchmarking and often uses only raw images or single pose extraction models.

Method: Created curated Yoga-16 dataset addressing limitations of existing datasets. Systematically evaluated three DL architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, Xception) with three input modalities: direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeletons, and YOLOv8 Pose skeletons.

Result: Skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs. Highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Provided interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM and cross-validation analysis.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based approaches are superior for yoga pose classification, with MediaPipe Pose + VGG16 combination showing best performance. Systematic benchmarking and interpretability analysis provide valuable insights for automated yoga posture assessment.

Abstract: Yoga is a popular form of exercise worldwide due to its spiritual and physical health benefits, but incorrect postures can lead to injuries. Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatireDecoder is a training-free framework using multi-agent visual cascaded decoupling and chain-of-thought reasoning with uncertainty analysis to improve visual satire comprehension in VLMs, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual satire comprehension is challenging for current vision-language models, requiring detection, nuanced meaning interpretation, and entity identification. Existing models fail to integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, biases, and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes SatireDecoder framework with: 1) multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations, and 2) chain-of-thought reasoning guided by uncertainty analysis that breaks down satire comprehension into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty.

Result: Experimental results show SatireDecoder significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations, outperforming existing baselines in comprehending visual satire.

Conclusion: SatireDecoder offers a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks, addressing the limitations of current models in visual satire comprehension through training-free, structured reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Satire, a form of artistic expression combining humor with implicit critique, holds significant social value by illuminating societal issues. Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedCT-VLM adapts CT-CLIP foundation model for medical CT imaging using LoRA, achieving significant zero-shot classification improvements with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have strong zero-shot capabilities but limited application to volumetric medical imaging; need to adapt large-scale CT models for clinical tasks efficiently.

Method: Parameter-efficient adaptation using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inserted into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38% of total) instead of full 440M parameter fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning improved mean AUROC from 61.3% to 68.9% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2% to 73.6% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1% to 36.9% (+4.8 pp) on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, especially valuable for zero-shot scenarios with scarce labeled data.

Abstract: Foundation models trained via vision-language pretraining have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse image domains, yet their application to volumetric medical imaging remains limited. We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\% of total). We evaluate on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies, where the model must align CT embeddings with unseen text prompts at inference without task-specific training. LoRA fine-tuning improves mean AUROC from 61.3\% to 68.9\% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2\% to 73.6\% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1\% to 36.9\% (+4.8 pp). These results demonstrate that parameter-efficient methods can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, Mask R-CNN) were evaluated for automated pith detection in tree cross-sections, with Swin Transformer achieving highest accuracy (0.94) and Mask R-CNN showing significant improvement with NMS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is currently manual and error-prone, creating a need for automated solutions to improve efficiency and accuracy in forestry and wood quality analysis.

Method: Used 582 labeled images with dynamic augmentation, evaluated five deep learning models (YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, Mask R-CNN), tested generalizability on oak dataset, and applied NMS to improve Mask R-CNN performance.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved highest accuracy (0.94) with excellent fine segmentation; YOLOv9 performed well for bounding boxes but struggled with boundaries; Mask R-CNN improved from 0.45 to 0.80 IoU with NMS; models showed varying performance on oak dataset generalizability.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows strong potential for automated pith detection, with model selection depending on dataset characteristics and application needs, though challenges like boundary precision and tensor mismatches require careful hyperparameter tuning and augmentation.

Abstract: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is essential for forestry and wood quality analysis but remains a manual, error-prone task. This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset. Key challenges included tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies, addressed through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation. Our results highlight deep learning's potential for tree cross-section pith detection, with model choice depending on dataset characteristics and application needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in skin lesion diagnosis: subjective methods, data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of DL models that hinder clinical trust and deployment.

Method: 1) Use DCGANs for per-class data augmentation to address class imbalance; 2) Fine-tune ResNet-50 classifier on augmented dataset for 7-class classification; 3) Integrate LIME and SHAP XAI techniques to provide transparency and verify predictions are based on clinically relevant features.

Result: Achieved 92.50% overall accuracy and 98.82% Macro-AUC, outperforming prior benchmarked architectures. Successfully validated a verifiable framework combining high performance with clinical interpretability.

Conclusion: The work presents a trustworthy CAD system that addresses key clinical challenges (imbalance, interpretability) and enables safe diagnostic deployment. Future work should focus on improving discrimination for critical categories like Melanoma NOS (F1-Score: 0.8602).

Abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis of multi-class skin lesions is hampered by subjective methods, inherent data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of Deep Learning (DL) models. This study proposes a trustworthy and highly accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to overcome these limitations. The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures. This work successfully validates a verifiable framework that combines high performance with the essential clinical interpretability required for safe diagnostic deployment. Future research should prioritize enhancing discrimination for critical categories, such as Melanoma NOS (F1-Score is 0.8602).

Motivation: Thyroid cancer prevalence is increasing globally, and accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is critical for developing AI-assisted clinical decision support systems in medical imaging.

Method: Used YOLOv5 algorithms (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge variants) for instance segmentation on ultrasound images, evaluating across two dataset versions with and without doppler images.

Result: YOLOv5-Large achieved highest performance with 91% dice score and 0.87 mAP on dataset including doppler images. Doppler images significantly improved performance across all model variants (e.g., YOLOv5-Small improved from 79% to higher scores).

Conclusion: Instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with doppler images offering significant performance improvements despite being typically excluded by physicians, suggesting potential for automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.

TL;DR: GAT-ADA: Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment for cross-domain facial expression recognition, achieving 74.39% mean accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain facial expression recognition is challenging due to severe domain shift between training and deployment data, requiring effective adaptation methods.

Method: Hybrid framework combining ResNet-50 backbone with batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model inter-sample relations, plus adversarial learning (GRL) and statistical alignment (CORAL, MMD) for domain adaptation.

Result: Achieves 74.39% mean cross-domain accuracy across multiple datasets, with 98.0% accuracy on RAF-DB to FER2013 adaptation (36-point improvement over best baseline).

Conclusion: GAT-ADA effectively addresses domain shift in facial expression recognition by combining graph attention for sample relations with adversarial and statistical domain alignment.

Abstract: Cross-domain facial expression recognition (CD-FER) remains difficult due to severe domain shift between training and deployment data. We propose Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment (GAT-ADA), a hybrid framework that couples a ResNet-50 as backbone with a batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model inter-sample relations under shift. Each mini-batch is cast as a sparse ring graph so that attention aggregates cross-sample cues that are informative for adaptation. To align distributions, GAT-ADA combines adversarial learning via a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) with statistical alignment using CORAL and MMD. GAT-ADA is evaluated under a standard unsupervised domain adaptation protocol: training on one labeled source (RAF-DB) and adapting to multiple unlabeled targets (CK+, JAFFE, SFEW 2.0, FER2013, and ExpW). GAT-ADA attains 74.39% mean cross-domain accuracy. On RAF-DB to FER2013, it reaches 98.0% accuracy, corresponding to approximately a 36-point improvement over the best baseline we re-implemented with the same backbone and preprocessing.

### [77] [MambaScope: Coarse-to-Fine Scoping for Efficient Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00647)
*Shanhui Liu,Rui Xu,Yunke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CF-ViM is an adaptive coarse-to-fine framework for Vision Mamba that reduces computation by processing simple images at coarse resolution and only refining complex regions when needed, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba's efficiency is limited by token count, and existing token reduction methods cause information loss by uniformly applying fine-grained processing to all images regardless of complexity. Simple images don't need fine processing, while complex ones do.

Method: CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference using large patches to reduce tokens. When prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at finer resolution to recover visual details. This dynamic resolution assignment adapts computation to image complexity.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show CF-ViM outperforms both baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: CF-ViM provides an adaptive framework that efficiently processes images by allocating computation according to visual complexity, avoiding unnecessary fine-grained processing while preserving essential visual information.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that CF-ViM outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

*Kiri L. Wagstaff*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers create more realistic multi-digit writer benchmarks using NIST data to better evaluate real-world number recognition systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world number recognition involves multiple digits written by the same person (ZIP codes, checks, times), but current benchmarks focus on isolated digits, creating a gap between research and practical applications.

Method: Leverage writer information from NIST digit images to create multi-digit writer (MDW) benchmark datasets that simulate realistic scenarios where the same person writes multiple digits.

Result: Classifiers that perform well on isolated digits often fail on multi-digit recognition, revealing the need for specialized approaches. MDW benchmarks include task-specific performance metrics that better reflect real-world impact.

Conclusion: MDW benchmarks address the gap between isolated digit classification research and practical number recognition, enabling development of methods that leverage task-specific knowledge for improved real-world performance.

Abstract: Isolated digit classification has served as a motivating problem for decades of machine learning research. In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.

TL;DR: Dynamic-eDiTor: A training-free text-driven 4D scene editing framework using MM-DiT and 4DGS for consistent multi-view video editing without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven 4D scene editing is challenging due to maintaining multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time. Existing 2D diffusion methods edit frames independently, causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing.

Method: Uses Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS). Features Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for local cross-view/temporal fusion and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement.

Result: Extensive experiments on DyNeRF dataset show superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: Dynamic-eDiTor enables seamless, globally consistent text-driven 4D scene editing without additional training, directly optimizing pre-trained 4DGS representations.

Abstract: Recent progress in 4D representations, such as Dynamic NeRF and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), has enabled dynamic 4D scene reconstruction. However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationGait is the first scalable, self-supervised gait foundation model with 0.13B parameters, pretrained on 2M+ walking sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse gait tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait models are small, narrowly designed, and fail to scale or generalize. The field needs a unified foundation model that addresses scalability (why gait models don't follow scaling laws) and generalization (can one model serve diverse gait tasks studied in isolation).

Method: FoundationGait is a scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework with largest version having 0.13B parameters, pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2M walking sequences. It uses a unified framework for diverse gait tasks.

Result: Achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on challenging Gait3D dataset (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on OU-MVLP dataset (5,000+ test subjects). Performs robustly across wide spectrum of gait datasets, conditions, tasks (human ID, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, attribute estimation), and input modalities.

Conclusion: FoundationGait sets a new milestone in robust gait recognition, demonstrating that scalable foundation models can effectively address longstanding barriers in gait analysis and enable unified understanding across diverse applications.

Abstract: Gait patterns play a critical role in human identification and healthcare analytics, yet current progress remains constrained by small, narrowly designed models that fail to scale or generalize. Building a unified gait foundation model requires addressing two longstanding barriers: (a) Scalability. Why have gait models historically failed to follow scaling laws? (b) Generalization. Can one model serve the diverse gait tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation? We introduce FoundationGait, the first scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding.

*Mengzhu Xu,Hanzhi Liu,Ningkang Peng,Qianyu Chen,Canran Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFD introduces affordance-first decomposition for continual video-language learning, separating stable affordance tokens from query-routed adaptation to minimize forgetting while enabling targeted plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning approaches for video-language understanding fail to properly distinguish between what should remain stable versus what should adapt, use static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos, which violates privacy constraints.

Method: AFD maps videos to slowly varying affordance tokens forming a shared time-aligned substrate, with lightweight query-routed conflict-aware scheduler for adaptation. Uses weak alignment, teacher consistency for stabilization, and question-only replay for training.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: 51.6% avg accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA.

Conclusion: AFD provides an explicit, interpretable split between stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation, offering effective continual learning for video-language understanding under realistic memory and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Continual learning for video--language understanding is increasingly important as models face non-stationary data, domains, and query styles, yet prevailing solutions blur what should stay stable versus what should adapt, rely on static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos. We aim to explicitly specify where stability lives and where plasticity should be focused under realistic memory and privacy constraints. We introduce Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD): videos are mapped to slowly varying affordance tokens that form a shared, time-aligned substrate, while a lightweight, query-routed, conflict-aware scheduler concentrates adaptation and grows capacity only when needed. The substrate is stabilized via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and training uses question-only replay. AFD achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% average accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA. Overall, AFD offers an explicit, interpretable split between a stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajDiff is a perception annotation-free end-to-end autonomous driving framework that uses trajectory-oriented BEV conditioned diffusion to generate diverse driving trajectories from raw sensor inputs without manual perception labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems rely on costly manual perception annotations. There's a need for perception annotation-free planning paradigms to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes TrajDiff with two key components: 1) Trajectory-oriented BEV encoder that extracts TrajBEV features from raw sensor inputs without perceptual supervision, and 2) Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT) that uses ego-state and TrajBEV features to generate diverse trajectories without handcrafted motion priors.

Result: Achieves 87.5 PDMS on NAVSIM benchmark (state-of-the-art among annotation-free methods). With data scaling, improves to 88.5 PDMS, comparable to advanced perception-based approaches.

Conclusion: TrajDiff demonstrates that perception annotation-free methods can achieve competitive performance with perception-based approaches while enabling exploration of data scaling benefits, offering a cost-effective alternative for autonomous driving development.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems directly generate driving policies from raw sensor inputs. While these systems can extract effective environmental features for planning, relying on auxiliary perception tasks, developing perception annotation-free planning paradigms has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of manual perception annotation. In this work, we propose TrajDiff, a Trajectory-oriented BEV Conditioned Diffusion framework that establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving. TrajDiff requires only raw sensor inputs and future trajectory, constructing Gaussian BEV heatmap targets that inherently capture driving modalities. We design a simple yet effective trajectory-oriented BEV encoder to extract the TrajBEV feature without perceptual supervision. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT), which leverages ego-state information and the predicted TrajBEV features to directly generate diverse yet plausible trajectories, eliminating the need for handcrafted motion priors. Beyond architectural innovations, TrajDiff enables exploration of data scaling benefits in the annotation-free setting. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves 87.5 PDMS, establishing state-of-the-art performance among all annotation-free methods. With data scaling, it further improves to 88.5 PDMS, which is comparable to advanced perception-based approaches. Our code and model will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: CAR-net is a cascade refinement network for deblurring rotationally motion-blurred images in semi-blind scenarios where only noisy blur angle information is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with rotational motion blur deblurring in semi-blind scenarios where blur parameters are uncertain or noisy, requiring robust architectures that can handle parameter uncertainty while effectively restoring image details.

Method: Uses a cascade refinement network starting with frequency-domain inversion for initial estimate, then applies progressive refinement stages that predict and apply residual corrections to suppress artifacts and restore details. Includes optional angle detection module for end-to-end training with refinement modules.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency through experiments on both synthetic and real-life images, with code, models, and dataset links publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: CAR-net effectively handles rotational motion blur deblurring in semi-blind scenarios through progressive refinement and optional parameter estimation, providing a practical solution with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: We propose a new neural network architecture called CAR-net (CAscade Refinement Network) to deblur images that are subject to rotational motion blur. Our architecture is specifically designed for the semi-blind scenarios where only noisy information of the rotational motion blur angle is available. The core of our approach is progressive refinement process that starts with an initial deblurred estimate obtained from frequency-domain inversion; A series of refinement stages take the current deblurred image to predict and apply residual correction to the current estimate, progressively suppressing artifacts and restoring fine details. To handle parameter uncertainty, our architecture accommodates an optional angle detection module which can be trained end-to-end with refinement modules. We provide a detailed description of our architecture and illustrate its efficiency through experiments using both synthetic and real-life images.

TL;DR: SwiftVLA enhances compact Vision-Language-Action models with 4D understanding using a 4D visual geometry transformer, Fusion Tokens, and mask-and-reconstruct training, achieving performance comparable to much larger models while being 18x faster with 12x lower memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models are too large for practical deployment, while lightweight alternatives compromise spatiotemporal reasoning. Current methods that incorporate 3D inputs still rely on large VLMs and lack temporal understanding.

Method: Uses a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with temporal cache to extract 4D features from 2D images. Introduces Fusion Tokens trained with future prediction to generate unified representations. Employs mask-and-reconstruct strategy to train the VLM on 4D representations, allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference.

Result: Outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger. Achieves comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times in both real and simulated environments.

Conclusion: SwiftVLA successfully enhances compact models with 4D understanding while maintaining efficiency, making VLA models more practical for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential but are limited in practicality due to their large parameter counts. To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

*Chengzhi Yu,Yifan Xu,Yifan Chen,Wenyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models using on-policy data, binary hallucination classification, and iterative DPO with dynamic sample reweighting, achieving significant hallucination reduction and surpassing GPT-4V performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM hallucination mitigation methods suffer from using off-policy data and introduce additional hallucinations in training samples, which may actually enhance the model's hallucination patterns rather than reduce them.

Method: 1) Use on-policy data instead of off-policy data; 2) Train a binary hallucination classifier to ensure clean chosen samples; 3) Implement iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) with dynamic sample reweighting scheme.

Result: Reduces hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; enables LLaVA-1.5-13B to surpass GPT-4V performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs by leveraging on-policy data with clean annotations and robust iterative DPO, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4V.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have risen to be a promising approach for multimodal tasks. However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our approach reduces the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and the average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; more significantly, our method fully taps into the potential of open-source models, enabling LLaVA-1.5-13B to even surpass the performance of GPT-4V.

MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive image segmentation methods designed for natural images struggle with remote sensing imagery due to scale variations, irregular boundaries, complex backgrounds, limited annotated data, and computational overhead.

Method: Adapter-based tuning strategy preserves general representations of Vision Foundation Models while learning remote sensing-specific features. Uses hybrid attention (convolutional local modeling + Transformer global reasoning) and improved probability map modulation incorporating historical user interactions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods on six remote sensing datasets (iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban, WHUBuilding) in segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and interaction cost.

Conclusion: RS-ISRefiner is effective and generalizable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios, addressing domain-specific challenges through efficient adaptation of foundation models.

Abstract: Interactive image segmentation(IIS) plays a critical role in generating precise annotations for remote sensing imagery, where objects often exhibit scale variations, irregular boundaries and complex backgrounds. However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP casts point cloud registration as conditional generation using learned velocity fields to transport noisy points to registered scenes, achieving SOTA results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration methods rely on correspondence matching and pairwise transformations, which can be complex and suboptimal, especially for low-overlap scenarios. The authors propose a more direct approach through conditional generation.

Method: Learned continuous point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to registered scenes; uses lightweight local feature extractor with test-time rigidity enforcement; directly generates registered point cloud rather than estimating transformations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap; generalizes across scales and sensor modalities; supports downstream tasks like relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and map merging.

Conclusion: The conditional generation approach to point cloud registration provides a more direct and effective solution that outperforms traditional correspondence-based methods while supporting various practical applications.

Abstract: Point cloud registration aligns multiple unposed point clouds into a common frame, and is a core step for 3D reconstruction and robot localization. In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities. It further supports downstream tasks including relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and multi-session map merging. Source code available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/RAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-GRPO improves text-to-image model alignment by addressing two limitations of existing GRPO methods: shared credit assignment and reward-mixing, using temporal and reward-based grouping for better advantage estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO-based methods for aligning text-to-image models suffer from shared credit assignment (uniform application of trajectory-level advantages across timesteps) and reward-mixing issues (predefined weights for multi-objective rewards causing unstable gradients and conflicting updates).

Method: Proposes Multi-GRPO with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms: 1) tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search for temporal grouping to better assign credit to early denoising steps, and 2) reward-based grouping to compute advantages for each reward function independently before aggregation. Also introduces OCR-Color-10 dataset for multi-objective evaluation.

Result: Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance across single-reward PickScore-25k and multi-objective OCR-Color-10 benchmarks, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

Conclusion: Multi-GRPO addresses critical limitations of existing GRPO methods through innovative grouping mechanisms, providing better credit assignment and multi-objective optimization for text-to-image model alignment.

Abstract: Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promising potential for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models, yet existing GRPO-based methods suffer from two critical limitations. (1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

TL;DR: RLWG is a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained video world models with geometric grounding using verifiable rewards, improving spatial coherence and navigation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models lack geometric grounding despite high visual fidelity, limiting their use in navigation tasks requiring spatial coherence and long-horizon stability.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG) framework uses geometric and perceptual rewards (pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, temporal coherence) to align pretrained world models. Implemented as GrndCtrl using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reward-aligned adaptation.

Result: World models maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

Conclusion: RLWG bridges generative pretraining and grounded behavior through verifiable rewards, analogous to RLVR in language models, enabling geometrically grounded world models for navigation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

The authors aim to improve both local feature extraction (via convolution) and non-local feature extraction (via transformer) to enhance compression performance.

Method: 1) Prior-guided convolution (PGConv): Uses asymmetric convolutions to strengthen skeleton elements and difference convolutions to extract high-frequency information, with re-parameterization to reduce complexity. 2) Multi-scale gated transformer (MGT): Uses dilated window-based multi-head self-attention with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolutions with different kernel sizes to extract multi-scale features, plus a gate mechanism for enhanced non-linearity. 3) Joint MGTPCN network: Combines both components for learned image compression.

Result: Experimental results show that MGTPCN surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms with a better trade-off between performance and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed MGTPCN framework effectively improves both local and non-local feature extraction capabilities through novel PGConv and MGT components, achieving superior compression performance with a favorable complexity trade-off compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression methods have made remarkable achievements, some of which have outperformed the traditional image codec VVC. The advantages of learned image compression methods over traditional image codecs can be largely attributed to their powerful nonlinear transform coding. Convolutional layers and shifted window transformer (Swin-T) blocks are the basic units of neural networks, and their representation capabilities play an important role in nonlinear transform coding. In this paper, to improve the ability of the vanilla convolution to extract local features, we propose a novel prior-guided convolution (PGConv), where asymmetric convolutions (AConvs) and difference convolutions (DConvs) are introduced to strengthen skeleton elements and extract high-frequency information, respectively. A re-parameterization strategy is also used to reduce the computational complexity of PGConv. Moreover, to improve the ability of the Swin-T block to extract non-local features, we propose a novel multi-scale gated transformer (MGT), where dilated window-based multi-head self-attention blocks with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolution layers with different kernel sizes are used to extract multi-scale features, and a gate mechanism is introduced to enhance non-linearity. Finally, we propose a novel joint Multi-scale Gated Transformer and Prior-guided Convolutional Network (MGTPCN) for learned image compression. Experimental results show that our MGTPCN surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms with a better trade-off between performance and complexity.

*Shaowei Liu,David Yifan Yao,Saurabh Gupta,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSync is an optimization framework that synchronizes unposed, unsynchronized videos from multiple consumer cameras at millisecond accuracy using multi-view dynamics and epipolar constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People can easily record events with multiple cameras, but synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods require controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or expensive hardware.

Method: VisualSync uses multi-view dynamics optimization that leverages epipolar constraints: any moving 3D point visible in two cameras must obey epipolar constraints when properly synchronized. The framework uses off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences, then jointly minimizes epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset.

Result: Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving median synchronization error below 50 ms.

Conclusion: VisualSync provides an effective solution for synchronizing unposed, unsynchronized videos from consumer cameras with high accuracy, addressing a practical problem in multi-camera recording scenarios.

Abstract: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

### [96] [Probabilistic Modeling of Multi-rater Medical Image Segmentation for Diversity and Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00748)
*Ke Liu,Shangde Gao,Yichao Fu,Shangqi Gao,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSeg introduces a probabilistic model for multi-rater medical image segmentation that simultaneously achieves both diverse and personalized segmentation outputs by modeling expert preferences and image ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-rater segmentation models are limited to either generating diverse segmentations without expert specificity or producing personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators, failing to address both needs simultaneously.

Method: Introduces two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity, with conditional probabilistic distributions obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and lung nodule (LIDC-IDRI) datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

Conclusion: ProSeg successfully addresses the limitations of previous multi-rater segmentation models by enabling simultaneous diversification and personalization through probabilistic modeling of expert preferences and image ambiguity.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is inherently influenced by data uncertainty, arising from ambiguous boundaries in medical scans and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

TL;DR: Hybrid pipeline combining real human-verified data and virtual AI-generated data enables robust bubble detection for self-driving lab pipetting with 99%+ accuracy while reducing data collection burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-driving labs need robust models but lack sufficient annotated training data, especially negative samples for precision-critical pipetting actions.

Method: Two-track approach: 1) Real track with human-in-the-loop automated acquisition and selective verification; 2) Virtual track using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation with reliability screening.

Result: Model trained on real images achieves 99.6% accuracy; mixing real and generated data maintains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection/review workload.

Conclusion: Scalable, cost-effective strategy for visual feedback data in SDLs, offering practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.

*Shawn Li,Ryan Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Sunav Choudhary,Franck Dernoncourt,Puneet Mathur,Zhengzhong Tu,Yue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FigEdit is a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing that challenges pixel-based generative models by framing chart editing as structured transformation rather than pixel manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models fail at scientific chart editing because they treat charts as pixel arrangements rather than structured data representations governed by graphical grammar. There's a fundamental mismatch between pixel-manipulation approaches and the structured transformation required for valid chart edits.

Method: Created FigEdit benchmark with over 30,000 samples covering 10 chart types, grounded in real-world data. Organized into five progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on scientific figures, consistently failing to handle required structured transformations. Traditional evaluation metrics (SSIM, PSNR) are inadequate for capturing semantic correctness of chart edits.

Conclusion: Pixel-level manipulation has profound limitations for chart editing. FigEdit provides a robust foundation for developing structure-aware models and enables systematic progress in scientific figure editing by understanding both visual and semantic layers.

Abstract: Generative models, such as diffusion and autoregressive approaches, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in editing natural images. However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) have limitations in capturing the semantic correctness of chart edits. Our benchmark demonstrates the profound limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating future structure-aware models. By releasing \textit{FigEdit} (https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing), we aim to enable systematic progress in structure-aware figure editing, provide a common ground for fair comparison, and encourage future research on models that understand both the visual and semantic layers of scientific charts.

Conclusion: The approach sheds light on understanding and modeling the physical processes behind pixels, bridging the gap between vision and physics, with promising applications in physics-based video manipulation.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computer vision is to model motions from videos, while the representations behind motions, i.e. the invisible physical interactions that cause objects to deform and move, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos.

### [100] [The Outline of Deception: Physical Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Signs Using Edge Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00765)
*Haojie Jia,Te Hu,Haowen Li,Long Jin,Chongshi Xin,Yuchi Yao,Jiarui Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESP-Attack: A stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic signs that uses edge-aligned masks and U-Net generation to create visually concealed attacks with high success rates and cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs lack stealth - they create visually obvious perturbations in central regions that are easily detectable by humans, limiting real-world practicality. These attacks can cause misclassification in intelligent driving systems and propagate through V2X networks, creating cascading failures that disrupt traffic flow and system safety.

Method: Uses instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to traffic sign shapes. A U-Net generator crafts adversarial patches optimized through color/texture constraints and frequency domain analysis for seamless background integration. The approach focuses on less-attended edge regions rather than central areas to achieve visual concealment.

Result: Achieves over 90% attack success rate across various traffic sign classification models under limited query budgets. Demonstrates strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.

Conclusion: TESP-Attack provides a highly effective and stealthy adversarial attack method for traffic signs that addresses the visual detectability limitations of current approaches while maintaining strong attack performance and real-world practicality.

Abstract: Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.

Motivation: Existing RGB-only 3D geometry estimation methods struggle with dynamic objects and extreme illumination conditions due to limitations of conventional cameras, creating a need for more robust approaches that can handle real-world challenging scenarios.

Method: Built on MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces: 1) Retinex-inspired image enhancement module and lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; 2) Novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks, especially in challenging dynamic low-light scenes.

Conclusion: EAG3R demonstrates that augmenting pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams enables robust geometry estimation in challenging real-world conditions without requiring retraining on night-time data, advancing the field of 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded, large-scale Japanese V&L resources significantly enhance model performance. DEJIMA dataset is publicly released with commercial licenses to advance Japanese multimodal research and applications.

Abstract: This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale resources for Japanese Vision-and-Language (V&L) modeling. We present a scalable and reproducible pipeline that integrates large-scale web collection with rigorous filtering/deduplication, object-detection-driven evidence extraction, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement under grounding constraints. Using this pipeline, we build two resources: an image-caption dataset (DEJIMA-Cap) and a VQA dataset (DEJIMA-VQA), each containing 3.88M image-text pairs, far exceeding the size of existing Japanese V&L datasets. Human evaluations demonstrate that DEJIMA achieves substantially higher Japaneseness and linguistic naturalness than datasets constructed via translation or manual annotation, while maintaining factual correctness at a level comparable to human-annotated corpora. Quantitative analyses of image feature distributions further confirm that DEJIMA broadly covers diverse visual domains characteristic of Japan, complementing its linguistic and cultural representativeness. Models trained on DEJIMA exhibit consistent improvements across multiple Japanese multimodal benchmarks, confirming that culturally grounded, large-scale resources play a key role in enhancing model performance. All data sources and modules in our pipeline are licensed for commercial use, and we publicly release the resulting dataset and metadata to encourage further research and industrial applications in Japanese V&L modeling.

TL;DR: PolarGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting by using polarization cues to resolve photometric ambiguities in reflective and textureless surfaces, improving geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface reconstruction methods for 3DGS degrade in photometrically ambiguous regions like reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable photometric cues disrupt geometry estimation. Polarization provides complementary optical information that can resolve these ambiguities.

Method: Two complementary modules: 1) Polarization-guided photometric correction that identifies reflective regions via Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refines reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; 2) Polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification for textureless areas that integrates Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process for back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians.

Result: PolarGS achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods and is framework-agnostic.

Conclusion: Leveraging polarization as an optical prior effectively resolves photometric ambiguities in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling more complete and accurate surface reconstruction in challenging reflective and textureless regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in surface reconstruction for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled remarkable geometric accuracy. However, their performance degrades in photometrically ambiguous regions such as reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable cues disrupt photometric consistency and hinder accurate geometry estimation. Reflected light is often partially polarized in a manner that reveals surface orientation, making polarization an optic complement to photometric cues in resolving such ambiguities. Therefore, we propose PolarGS, an optics-aware extension of RGB-based 3DGS that leverages polarization as an optical prior to resolve photometric ambiguities and enhance reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: a polarization-guided photometric correction strategy, which ensures photometric consistency by identifying reflective regions via the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refining reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; and a polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification mechanism for textureless area geometry recovery, which integrates both Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process. This enables the back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians, leading to more complete reconstruction. PolarGS is framework-agnostic and achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CircleFlow: A high-fidelity PSF estimation framework using flow-guided edge localization and implicit neural representation for accurate camera blur characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for optical characterization and computational vision but remains challenging due to ambiguity and ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution.

Method: Uses structured capture of circle grid target to encode PSFs, leverages binary luminance prior, reconstructs sharp image via subpixel alignment guided by optical flow, models PSF as energy-constrained implicit neural representation, and jointly optimizes both in demosaicing-aware differentiable framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability for practical PSF calibration.

Conclusion: CircleFlow provides physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization, validating its effectiveness for practical applications.

Abstract: The point spread function (PSF) serves as a fundamental descriptor linking the real-world scene to the captured signal, manifesting as camera blur. Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for both optical characterization and computational vision, yet remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution. We introduce CircleFlow, a high-fidelity PSF estimation framework that employs flow-guided edge localization for precise blur characterization. CircleFlow begins with a structured capture that encodes locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs by imaging a circle grid target, while leveraging the target's binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. The latent sharp image is then reconstructed through subpixel alignment of an initialized binary structure guided by optical flow, whereas the PSF is modeled as an energy-constrained implicit neural representation. Both components are jointly optimized within a demosaicing-aware differentiable framework, ensuring physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that CircleFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability, validating its effectiveness for practical PSF calibration.

TL;DR: SpecTemp uses reinforcement learning with dual MLLMs to accelerate video understanding by having a draft model propose salient frames and a target model verify them, reducing redundant multimodal context processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current thinking-with-frames video MLLMs suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to growing redundant multimodal context, despite enabling coherent perception over extended temporal contexts.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based speculative temporal reasoning framework with dual-model design: lightweight draft MLLM proposes salient frames from dense temporal regions, powerful target MLLM verifies proposals and refines attention iteratively until convergence.

Result: Maintains competitive accuracy across multiple video understanding benchmarks while significantly accelerating inference compared to existing thinking-with-frames methods.

Conclusion: SpecTemp balances efficiency and accuracy by decoupling temporal perception from reasoning, mirroring human brain collaborative pathways, and demonstrates practical improvements for long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding is essential for human-like intelligence, enabling coherent perception and reasoning over extended temporal contexts. While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.

TL;DR: IRPO is a novel GRPO-based post-training paradigm for low-level vision tasks that addresses over-smoothing and poor generalization in image restoration through optimized data formulation and multi-component reward modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, which leads to over-smoothing and poor generalization. Post-training paradigms have shown success in high-level generation tasks but remain unexplored for low-level vision.

Method: IRPO introduces two key innovations: 1) A data formulation principle that selects underperforming samples from pre-training for optimal performance and efficiency, and 2) A reward-level criteria system with three components: General Reward for structural fidelity, Expert Reward using Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality.

Result: IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results on six in-domain and five out-of-domain low-level benchmarks, surpassing AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings across diverse degradation types.

Conclusion: IRPO successfully demonstrates the potential of post-training paradigms for low-level vision, addressing key limitations of traditional image restoration methods through systematic exploration of data formulation and reward modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training paradigms have achieved remarkable success in high-level generation tasks, yet their potential for low-level vision remains rarely explored. Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing panoramic video generation methods lack explicit motion control and struggle with large, complex motions, limiting their practical applications in virtual reality and immersive media.

Method: Exploits spherical nature of panoramas to decouple camera rotation from input optical flow, introduces spherical noise warping for loop consistency, and uses a curated large-scale motion-rich dataset with pose and flow annotations.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation has attracted growing attention due to its applications in virtual reality and immersive media. However, existing methods lack explicit motion control and struggle to generate scenes with large and complex motions. We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method in various applications, including motion transfer and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanFlow significantly outperforms prior methods in motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence.

*Neeraj Anand,Rishabh Jain,Sohan Patnaik,Balaji Krishnamurthy,Mausoom Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFRAgent is a compact instruct-BLIP-based multimodal model for mobile UI automation that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being 4x smaller than competitors, using adaptive feature renormalization to enhance image embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for mobile UI automation across industries. While VLMs enable autonomous task execution by processing on-screen content directly and using human-like actions, existing models struggle with accurate widget identification and action determination due to limited spatial information in vision features, and top models are too large with slow inference.

Method: AFRAgent uses an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture with adaptive feature renormalization - a token-level affine transformation technique that enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details to enhance image embeddings in the LLM pipeline.

Result: AFRAgent achieves superior performance on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art for smartphone automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor.

Conclusion: AFRAgent demonstrates that compact multimodal models with enhanced image embedding techniques can achieve state-of-the-art GUI automation performance, addressing both accuracy and efficiency challenges in mobile UI automation.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for mobile user interface (UI) automation, driven by its broad applications across industries. With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details. We evaluate AFRAgent on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline for smartphone automation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smol-GS learns compact 3D Gaussian Splatting representations using recursive voxel hierarchy for coordinates and splat-wise features for visual properties, achieving state-of-the-art compression with high rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create highly efficient 3D scene representations that integrate both spatial and semantic information while enabling significant compression without sacrificing flexibility for downstream applications.

Method: Uses recursive voxel hierarchy to capture splat coordinates and splat-wise features to store abstracted visual properties (color, opacity, transformation, material). Combines spatial and semantic information in compact 3D encodings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks while maintaining high rendering quality. Compresses 3D scenes by orders of magnitude without loss of flexibility.

Conclusion: Smol-GS provides efficient 3D representations that could serve as foundation for downstream tasks like navigation, planning, and broader 3D scene understanding, beyond just visual fidelity.

Abstract: We present Smol-GS, a novel method for learning compact representations for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach learns highly efficient encodings in 3D space that integrate both spatial and semantic information. The model captures the coordinates of the splats through a recursive voxel hierarchy, while splat-wise features store abstracted cues, including color, opacity, transformation, and material properties. This design allows the model to compress 3D scenes by orders of magnitude without loss of flexibility. Smol-GS achieves state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks while maintaining high rendering quality. Beyond visual fidelity, the discrete representations could potentially serve as a foundation for downstream tasks such as navigation, planning, and broader 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical foundation models require extensive fine-tuning or resource-intensive decoders, and many encoders have task-biased pretraining objectives, creating a need for strong, task-agnostic models that require minimal adaptation beyond feature extraction.

Method: Adapts Vision Transformers and DINOv2 for volumetric CT data with modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations to make the architecture depth-aware while preserving simplicity. Uses self-supervised pretraining on 105K CT volumes.

Result: Large-scale 3D pretraining yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks, establishing a powerful baseline for medical imaging research.

Conclusion: TAP-CT provides a task-agnostic CT foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning, with all pretrained models, configurations, and benchmark code released to promote transparency and reproducibility in medical imaging research.

Abstract: Existing foundation models (FMs) in the medical domain often require extensive fine-tuning or rely on training resource-intensive decoders, while many existing encoders are pretrained with objectives biased toward specific tasks. This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks. To promote transparency and reproducibility, and to establish a powerful, low-resource baseline for future research in medical imaging, we will release all pretrained models, experimental configurations, and downstream benchmark code at https://huggingface.co/fomofo/tap-ct-b-3d.

TL;DR: DeepPriorCBCT: A deep learning framework that reduces CBCT radiation dose by 83% (to 1/6 of conventional) while maintaining diagnostic quality, validated through large multicenter retrospective data and a prospective clinical trial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT-guided thoracic tumor procedures expose patients to significant radiation, increasing secondary malignancy risk. Existing low-dose CBCT methods lack validation with large multicenter datasets and prospective clinical evaluation.

Method: Three-stage deep learning framework (DeepPriorCBCT) for diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only 1/6 of conventional radiation dose. Developed and validated using 4,102 patients with 8,675 CBCT scans from 12 centers, plus a prospective cross-over trial (NCT07035977) with 138 patients.

Result: 11 physicians found reconstructed images indistinguishable from original scans. Diagnostic performance and image quality comparable to standard reconstruction. Prospective trial: 5 radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment (all P>0.05). 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure reduced to ~1/6 of conventional.

Conclusion: DeepPriorCBCT enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while significantly reducing intraoperative radiation risk, validated through both retrospective multicenter data and prospective clinical trial.

Abstract: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided puncture has become an established approach for diagnosing and treating early- to mid-stage thoracic tumours, yet the associated radiation exposure substantially elevates the risk of secondary malignancies. Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as revolutionary 3D representation but suffers from substantial data size that hinders widespread adoption. Existing feed-forward compression methods struggle with long-range spatial dependencies due to limited receptive fields and inadequate context capacity.

Method: Proposes feed-forward 3DGS compression framework with: 1) Large-scale context structure comprising thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization, 2) Fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to leverage expansive context, 3) Attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from wide range of neighboring Gaussians.

Result: Achieves 20× compression ratio for 3DGS in feed-forward inference and state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations, overcoming limitations of existing methods and making 3DGS more practical for widespread adoption.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a revolutionary 3D representation. However, its substantial data size poses a major barrier to widespread adoption. While feed-forward 3DGS compression offers a practical alternative to costly per-scene per-train compressors, existing methods struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies, due to the limited receptive field of transform coding networks and the inadequate context capacity in entropy models. In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward 3DGS compression framework that effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations. Central to our approach is a large-scale context structure that comprises thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization. We then design a fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to fully leverage this expansive context. Furthermore, we develop an attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from a wide range of neighboring Gaussians. Our method yields a $20\times$ compression ratio for 3DGS in a feed-forward inference and achieves state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

Method: Quantum-inspired geometric framework representing operators by normalized singular value spectrum on Bloch hypersphere; spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem; Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and one-shot structured pruning.

Result: Proposed metric shows superiority over magnitude and random baselines in controlled simulation; extensive experimental validation on large-scale multimodal transformers and domestic heterogeneous hardware (Huawei Ascend, Cambricon MLU, Kunlunxin) is in preparation.

Conclusion: Establishes first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability, enabling efficient deployment of multimodal intelligence on resource-constrained domestic hardware through quantum-inspired geometric analysis.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal intelligence on resource-constrained and heterogeneous domestic hardware exposes critical bottlenecks: multimodal feature heterogeneity, real-time requirements in dynamic scenarios, and hardware-specific operator redundancy. This work introduces a quantum-inspired geometric framework for neural operators that represents each operator by its normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere. We prove a tight spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem showing that vanishing Fubini--Study/Wasserstein-2 distance implies provable functional closeness, establishing the first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability. Based on this metric, we propose Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and one-shot structured pruning. Controlled simulation validates the superiority of the proposed metric over magnitude and random baselines. An extensive experimental validation on large-scale multimodal transformers and domestic heterogeneous hardware (Huawei Ascend, Cambricon MLU, Kunlunxin) hardware is deferred to an extended journal version currently in preparation.

TL;DR: Proposes "Look, Recite, Then Answer" framework to reduce hallucinations in VLMs for specialized domains by using self-generated knowledge hints and evidence alignment


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" in specialized domains like precision agriculture, where linguistic priors override visual perception due to the "Modality Gap" - visual embeddings fail to activate fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters

Method: Three-stage parameter-efficient framework: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite uses lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select most consistent label

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on AgroBench, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead

Conclusion: Modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval while keeping backbone models frozen

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture, primarily due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception. A key bottleneck is the "Modality Gap": visual embeddings fail to reliably activate the fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters. We propose "Look, Recite, Then Answer," a parameter-efficient framework that enhances VLMs via self-generated knowledge hints while keeping backbone models frozen. The framework decouples inference into three stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite employs a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label. On AgroBench, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead. This modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HanDyVQA is a new fine-grained video QA benchmark for hand-object interaction dynamics, covering manipulation and effects with 11.1K QA pairs and 10.3K segmentation masks. Current models achieve only 73% accuracy vs. human 97%, revealing challenges in spatial, motion, and part-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand-object interaction benchmarks focus either on manipulation or effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics of how human manipulations produce distinct effects on objects.

Method: Created HanDyVQA benchmark with six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, Object Parts) totaling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs and 10.3K segmentation masks for object/part-level reasoning. Evaluated recent video foundation models and analyzed performance gaps.

Result: Best-performing model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieved only 73% average accuracy, far from human performance (97%). Analysis revealed remaining challenges in spatial relationships, motion understanding, and part-level geometric reasoning. Integration of explicit HOI-related cues improved performance.

Conclusion: HanDyVQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained HOI dynamics understanding. The significant performance gap between models and humans highlights the need for better spatial, motion, and part-level reasoning in video understanding. Explicit HOI cues can help improve future models.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) inherently involves dynamics where human manipulations produce distinct spatio-temporal effects on objects. However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.

TL;DR: First training-free multilingual remote sensing image captioning using retrieval-augmented prompting with SigLIP2 encoder and language models, achieving competitive performance across 10 languages without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current remote sensing captioning: reliance on large annotated datasets, English-only focus restricting global applicability, and need for more inclusive/scalable Earth observation systems.

Method: Retrieval-augmented prompting with domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions/examples from datastore. Two variants: (1) image-blind multilingual LLM from textual prompts, (2) image-aware VLM processing prompt+image. Graph-based PageRank re-ranking improves coherence.

Result: Competitive with fully supervised English-only systems, generalizes to 10 languages. PageRank re-ranking yields up to 35% improvements. LLMs achieve stronger BLEU/CIDEr scores, VLMs produce more visually grounded captions. Direct target-language generation outperforms translation-based strategies.

Conclusion: First systematic evaluation of multilingual training-free captioning for remote sensing, advancing toward inclusive/scalable multimodal Earth observation systems without requiring large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning has advanced rapidly through encoder--decoder models, although the reliance on large annotated datasets and the focus on English restricts global applicability. To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies. Overall, our work delivers one of the first systematic evaluations of multilingual, training-free captioning for remote sensing imagery, advancing toward more inclusive and scalable multimodal Earth observation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming VideoLLMs face computational bottlenecks in real-time deployment due to redundant processing of similar frames in ViT encoding and inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling, causing latency and memory overhead.

Method: STC introduces two token-level accelerators: STC-Cacher reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and STC-Pruner compresses visual token sequences before LLM entry by preserving only the most salient tokens based on spatial and temporal relevance.

Result: STC outperforms other compression methods, retaining up to 99% accuracy on ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency by 24.5% and LLM pre-filling latency by 45.3% across four baseline streaming VideoLLMs on five benchmarks.

Conclusion: STC provides an effective plug-and-play solution for accelerating streaming VideoLLMs by addressing computational bottlenecks through hierarchical token compression, enabling more efficient real-time video understanding.

Abstract: Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of 12 foraminifera species using 2D micro-CT slices derived from 3D scans. We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning.

We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient.

TL;DR: CAE is a training-free hierarchical semantic alignment method for image clustering that combines caption-level descriptions and noun-level concepts via optimal transport to address noun ambiguity and improve clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image clustering methods that use nouns as external semantic knowledge often overlook noun ambiguity, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. There's a need to address this limitation while maintaining a training-free approach.

Method: CAE incorporates two complementary textual semantics: caption-level descriptions (fine-grained attributes) and noun-level concepts (high-level object categories). It selects relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets, constructs a semantic space aligned with image features, aligns image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport, and combines enhanced semantic and image features for clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 datasets show CAE's effectiveness, notably surpassing state-of-the-art training-free approaches with 4.2% improvement in accuracy and 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on ImageNet-1K dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical semantic alignment method effectively addresses noun ambiguity in image clustering by leveraging complementary textual semantics through optimal transport, achieving significant performance improvements without requiring training.

Abstract: Image clustering is a classic problem in computer vision, which categorizes images into different groups. Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art training-free approach with a 4.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

TL;DR: TalkingPose is a diffusion-based framework for generating long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations from single images and driving poses, overcoming computational limitations of existing methods through a feedback mechanism without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for character animation struggle with generating temporally coherent long-form content due to computational and memory constraints from training on short video segments, limiting their effectiveness for extended animations.

Method: TalkingPose uses a stable diffusion backbone to transfer expressive facial and hand movements from driving frames to target actors, with a feedback-driven mechanism for continuous motion and temporal coherence that doesn't require additional training or computational costs.

Result: The framework enables generation of animations with unlimited duration while maintaining temporal consistency, and introduces a comprehensive large-scale dataset as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.

Conclusion: TalkingPose addresses key limitations in long-form character animation generation through an efficient feedback mechanism, paving the way for extended coherent animations without computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved the realism and generalizability of character-driven animation, enabling the synthesis of high-quality motion from just a single RGB image and a set of driving poses. Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale dataset to serve as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-upright panoramas from unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks in robotic vision. IMU-based methods suffer from drift and disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative.

Method: Dual-stream angle-aware generation network with CNN branch for local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and ViT branch for global contextual cues from cubemap projections, integrated through dual-projection adaptive fusion module. Enhanced with high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on SUN360 and M3D datasets in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation. Ablation studies validate contribution of each module and highlight synergy between tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-stream network effectively addresses non-upright panorama correction in robotic vision, offering improved performance over traditional methods through synergistic multi-projection fusion.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capable of capturing a 360-degree field of view, are crucial in robotic vision, particularly in environments with sparse features. However, non-upright panoramas due to unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks. Traditional IMU-based correction methods suffer from drift and external disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative. This study presents a dual-stream angle-aware generation network that jointly estimates camera inclination angles and reconstructs upright panoramic images. The network comprises a CNN branch that extracts local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and a ViT branch that captures global contextual cues from cubemap projections. These are integrated through a dual-projection adaptive fusion module that aligns spatial features across both domains. To further enhance performance, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms to preserve 360° continuity and improve geometric sensitivity. Experiments on the SUN360 and M3D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each module and highlight the synergy between the two tasks.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two simple MLP parameter reduction strategies for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K achieve better accuracy and training stability than baseline while reducing parameters by 32.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers often show improved performance with scale, but accuracy doesn't always increase monotonically. The paper investigates whether ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K operates in an overparameterized regime where MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance.

Method: Two parameter-reduction strategies applied to MLP blocks: 1) GroupedMLP shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks, and 2) ShallowMLP halves the MLP hidden dimension. Both remove 32.7% of baseline parameters.

Result: GroupedMLP achieves 81.47% top-1 accuracy (vs baseline 81.05%) with same computational cost. ShallowMLP reaches 81.25% accuracy with 38% faster inference. Both show improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47% to 0.03-0.06%.

Conclusion: ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K operates in an overparameterized regime where MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance. Architectural constraints like parameter sharing and reduced width act as useful inductive biases, highlighting the importance of parameter allocation in Vision Transformer design.

Abstract: Although scaling laws and many empirical results suggest that increasing the size of Vision Transformers often improves performance, model accuracy and training behavior are not always monotonically increasing with scale. Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAHNet introduces local attention with locality bias and Group Transformer for point cloud registration, using Locality-Sensitive Hashing for window partitioning and Interaction Transformer for overlap region matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud descriptors focus too much on local information, lacking broader receptive fields needed for distinctive features in registration tasks.

Method: Proposes LAHNet with Group Transformer using Locality-Sensitive Hashing for non-overlapping window partitioning, cross-window strategy for expanded receptive field, and Interaction Transformer with overlap matrix for matching overlap regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show LAHNet learns robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAHNet effectively addresses the need for broader receptive fields in point cloud registration through local attention mechanisms and efficient windowing strategies.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based point cloud descriptors for point cloud registration focus on perceiving local information of point clouds to generate distinctive features. However, a reasonable and broader receptive field is essential for enhancing feature distinctiveness. In this paper, we propose a Local Attentive Hashing Network for point cloud registration, called LAHNet, which introduces a local attention mechanism with the inductive bias of locality of convolution-like operators into point cloud descriptors. Specifically, a Group Transformer is designed to capture reasonable long-range context between points. This employs a linear neighborhood search strategy, Locality-Sensitive Hashing, enabling uniformly partitioning point clouds into non-overlapping windows. Meanwhile, an efficient cross-window strategy is adopted to further expand the reasonable feature receptive field. Furthermore, building on this effective windowing strategy, we propose an Interaction Transformer to enhance the feature interactions of the overlap regions within point cloud pairs. This computes an overlap matrix to match overlap regions between point cloud pairs by representing each window as a global signal. Extensive results demonstrate that LAHNet can learn robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CycliST is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating Video Language Models' ability to reason about cyclical state transitions in synthetic videos with periodic patterns, revealing current VLMs struggle with temporal understanding and cyclic pattern detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Language Models lack robust temporal understanding and struggle with cyclical dynamics, which are fundamental to real-world processes. There's a need for better evaluation of VLMs' spatio-temporal cognition and their ability to detect and exploit periodic patterns in visual data.

Method: Created CycliST benchmark dataset with synthetic video sequences featuring cyclical patterns in object motion and visual attributes. Uses tiered evaluation system with progressive difficulty through variations in cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions. Conducted extensive experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs (both open-source and proprietary).

Result: Current VLMs struggle with cyclical dynamics (linear/orbital motion) and time-dependent visual attribute changes. Models lack reliable cyclic pattern detection, temporal understanding, and quantitative insight extraction. No single model consistently leads in performance - neither size nor architecture strongly correlates with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally across all tasks.

Conclusion: CycliST reveals significant technical gaps in current VLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities and provides a targeted challenge framework to drive development of visual reasoning models that can better understand periodic patterns, paving the way for surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

*Keita Otani,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneProp reformulates scene-graph grounding as MAP inference in an MRF, using differentiable belief propagation to jointly satisfy all constraints, achieving better performance with more complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard phrase grounding methods lack structural bias for complex relational queries, and existing scene-graph grounding methods paradoxically perform worse with more detailed queries despite having more information.

Method: Reformulates scene-graph grounding as Maximum a Posteriori inference in a Markov Random Field, using differentiable Belief Propagation for end-to-end global inference over the entire query graph.

Result: Outperforms prior work on four benchmarks, with accuracy consistently improving with query graph size/complexity, demonstrating that more relational context leads to better grounding.

Conclusion: SceneProp successfully addresses the structural deficit in grounding complex queries by treating scene-graph grounding as a global inference problem, showing that more relational information should improve rather than hinder performance.

Abstract: Grounding complex, compositional visual queries with multiple objects and relationships is a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. While standard phrase grounding methods excel at localizing single objects, they lack the structural inductive bias to parse intricate relational descriptions, often failing as queries become more descriptive. To address this structural deficit, we focus on scene-graph grounding, a powerful but less-explored formulation where the query is an explicit graph of objects and their relationships. However, existing methods for this task also struggle, paradoxically showing decreased performance as the query graph grows -- failing to leverage the very information that should make grounding easier. We introduce SceneProp, a novel method that resolves this issue by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). By performing global inference over the entire query graph, SceneProp finds the optimal assignment of image regions to nodes that jointly satisfies all constraints. This is achieved within an end-to-end framework via a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our dedicated focus on the scene-graph grounding formulation allows SceneProp to significantly outperform prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating for the first time that more relational context can, and should, lead to better grounding.

TL;DR: 3D-GS segmentation method using binary encoding for memory efficiency and progressive training for fine-grained segmentation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-GS segmentation methods have high memory overhead from category features and struggle with fine-grained segmentation due to label space congestion and lack of multi-granularity control

Method: Coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme compresses per-Gaussian features into single integers; progressive training decomposes panoptic segmentation into independent sub-tasks; fine-tunes opacity to address rendering-segmentation incompatibility

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference across multiple benchmarks

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively addresses memory efficiency and fine-grained segmentation challenges in 3D-GS, offering practical improvements for semantic tasks

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as an efficient 3D representation and a promising foundation for semantic tasks like segmentation. However, existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods typically rely on high-dimensional category features, which introduce substantial memory overhead. Moreover, fine-grained segmentation remains challenging due to label space congestion and the lack of stable multi-granularity control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, which compresses each feature into a single integer via the binary-to-decimal mapping, drastically reducing memory usage. We further design a progressive training strategy that decomposes panoptic segmentation into a series of independent sub-tasks, reducing inter-class conflicts and thereby enhancing fine-grained segmentation capability. Additionally, we fine-tune opacity during segmentation training to address the incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation, which often leads to foreground-background confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference.

TL;DR: SocialFusion: A unified framework that addresses "social degradation" in VLMs by learning minimal connections between frozen visual encoder and language model, achieving positive transfer across five social perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (VLMs) surprisingly struggle with social perception tasks despite their general capabilities, exhibiting negative transfer due to "social degradation" - where pre-training impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information.

Method: Proposes SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns minimal connections between a frozen visual encoder and language model. Investigates social degradation through two lenses: decodability (linear representation probing) and compatibility (gradient conflict analysis).

Result: SocialFusion exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance, achieving comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence, highlighting the need for more socially-aware training paradigms. SocialFusion demonstrates a promising approach to address social degradation in VLMs.

Abstract: Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.

TL;DR: DEMR introduces debiased evidential learning for moment retrieval, addressing uncertainty estimation biases through reflective flipped fusion and geom-regularizer to improve temporal-semantic robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional moment retrieval methods struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to poor alignment with complex/ambiguous moments. Deep Evidential Regression (DER) has limitations in handling modality imbalance and structural differences in uncertainty regularizers, causing high uncertainty to be incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones.

Method: Proposes Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR) with: 1) Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment, 2) query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, and 3) Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions for adaptive alignment with difficult moments.

Result: Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets (ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD) demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning the approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

Conclusion: DEMR successfully addresses uncertainty estimation biases in moment retrieval through debiased evidential learning, improving alignment with challenging moments and enhancing overall retrieval performance while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: In the domain of moment retrieval, accurately identifying temporal segments within videos based on natural language queries remains challenging. Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

*Han-Jin Lee,Han-Ju Lee,Jin-Seong Kim,Seok-Hwan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAC: A diffusion guidance method that projects adversarial gradients onto tangent spaces to preserve sample quality while maintaining attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial diffusion sampling achieves target classification but degrades sample quality due to trajectory deviations. Need to balance attack success with perceptual fidelity.

Method: Formalize degradation as path-space KL divergence, derive optimality condition for control, and propose DPAC: Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control that projects adversarial gradients onto tangent spaces defined by generative score geometry.

Result: Theoretical: DPAC minimizes path-KL, tightens Wasserstein/FID bounds, cancels O(Δt) error in discrete solvers. Empirical: On ImageNet-100, achieves lower FID and path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Conclusion: DPAC provides principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity, enabling high-quality adversarial samples through tangent space projection of gradients.

Abstract: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Motivation: Monocular internet videos offer vast, diverse human-object interaction data, but extracting accurate 4D interaction data from in-the-wild videos remains a significant unsolved challenge for training generalized robots.

Method: 4DHOISolver - a novel optimization framework that constrains ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction using sparse human-in-the-loop contact point annotations while maintaining spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility.

Result: Created Open4DHOI dataset with 144 object types and 103 actions; demonstrated RL-based agent imitation of recovered motions; benchmark showed existing 3D foundation models cannot yet predict precise human-object contact correspondences.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop strategy is currently necessary for accurate 4D HOI reconstruction, posing an open challenge for automated contact prediction while providing valuable data and framework for robot learning.

Abstract: Generalized robots must learn from diverse, large-scale human-object interactions (HOI) to operate robustly in the real world. Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

TL;DR: PhotoFramer is a multi-modal framework that provides composition guidance by generating both textual instructions and example images to help users improve poorly composed photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many casual users struggle with photo composition, but existing tools lack comprehensive guidance that combines actionable advice with visual examples.

Method: Uses a hierarchical approach (shift, zoom-in, view-change tasks) with a curated dataset from existing cropping datasets and synthesized poor images via a degradation model applied to expert photos.

Result: Textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and combining them with visual exemplars outperforms exemplar-only baselines.

Conclusion: PhotoFramer represents a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic knowledge accessible to everyday users through multi-modal guidance.

Abstract: Composition matters during the photo-taking process, yet many casual users struggle to frame well-composed images. To provide composition guidance, we introduce PhotoFramer, a multi-modal composition instruction framework. Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users. Codes, model weights, and datasets have been released in https://zhiyuanyou.github.io/photoframer.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the localized manipulation detection gap by combining local facial features with global context and LLM interpretability, offering an effective solution for multi-modal media manipulation detection.

Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: S2AM3D successfully addresses the generalization and consistency challenges in 3D part segmentation by effectively incorporating 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision and providing adjustable granularity control.

Abstract: Part-level point cloud segmentation has recently attracted significant attention in 3D computer vision. Nevertheless, existing research is constrained by two major challenges: native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, while introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views. To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.

### [135] [S$^2$-MLLM: Boosting Spatial Reasoning Capability of MLLMs for 3D Visual Grounding with Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01223)
*Beining Xu,Siting Zhu,Zhao Jin,Junxian Li,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S²-MLLM enhances 3D visual grounding in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning, eliminating inefficient point cloud reconstruction while improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with 3D spatial understanding from 2D inputs, and existing methods rely on inefficient viewpoint-dependent rendering of point clouds, limiting spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes S²-MLLM with spatial guidance strategy using feed-forward 3D reconstruction for structural awareness, and a structure-enhanced module with intra-view/inter-view attention and multi-level position encoding.

Result: Achieves superior performance, generalization, and efficiency across ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: S²-MLLM successfully enhances 3D spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit structural understanding, offering a unified solution that balances performance, generalization, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

*Zirui Zhao,Boye Niu,David Hsu,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A constraint-guided framework combining geometric reasoning with neural semantics for abstract visual composition, using AlphaGo-style search with vision-language model rewards and adversarial refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstract visual composition with geometric primitives is challenging due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, discrete feasibility constraints, and sparse solution manifolds that are ill-suited for purely statistical pixel-space generators.

Method: Constraint-guided framework combining explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. Uses AlphaGo-style search to enforce feasibility, fine-tuned vision-language model for semantic alignment scoring, policy network as heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search, and adversarial reward refinement inspired by GANs.

Result: In Tangram Assembly task, approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively addresses the challenges of abstract visual composition by combining geometric constraint satisfaction with neural semantic understanding, outperforming purely statistical methods.

Abstract: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LISA-3D is a two-stage framework that lifts 2D language-image segmentation to 3D reconstruction using geometry-aware LoRA layers and frozen SAM-3D, achieving improved accuracy with minimal parameter adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven 3D reconstruction needs mask generators that understand open-vocabulary instructions while maintaining cross-view consistency, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Retrofit LISA with geometry-aware LoRA layers for cross-view consistent masks, 2) Use frozen SAM-3D reconstructor with RGBA prompts (RGB + masks) to output Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining.

Result: Improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, adapting only 11.6M parameters. Supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories.

Conclusion: LISA-3D provides a practical, modular, and data-efficient recipe for language-guided 3D content creation with strong cross-view consistency and zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D reconstruction demands a mask generator that simultaneously understands open-vocabulary instructions and remains consistent across viewpoints. We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters. The system is modular, data-efficient, and supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories, providing a practical recipe for language-guided 3D content creation.

*Huynh Trinh Ngoc,Toan Nguyen Hai,Ba Luong Son,Long Tran Quoc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSegLatDiff is a diffusion-based framework combining VAE with latent diffusion for efficient medical image segmentation that generates multiple plausible masks with confidence maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical image segmentation produces single masks lacking uncertainty capture, while recent generative models are computationally heavy. Need for efficient methods that capture uncertainty like multiple clinicians' interpretations.

Method: Combines VAE with latent diffusion model: VAE compresses input to low-dimensional latent space (reduces noise, accelerates training), diffusion operates in compact representation. Uses weighted cross-entropy loss in VAE mask reconstruction to preserve tiny structures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). Generates diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps.

Conclusion: Provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment by capturing uncertainty and generating multiple plausible segmentations.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

*Jing He,Haodong Li,Mingzhi Sheng,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lotus-2: A two-stage deterministic framework that adapts diffusion model priors for stable, accurate monocular depth and surface normal estimation using only 59K training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular geometric property recovery is ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity. While discriminative models are limited by data scale/quality, and diffusion models have powerful world priors, their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference which requires stable, accurate predictions.

Method: Two-stage deterministic framework: 1) Core predictor uses single-step deterministic formulation with clean-data objective and lightweight local continuity module for globally coherent structures. 2) Detail sharpener performs constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold to enhance fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching.

Result: Using only 59K training samples (<1% of existing datasets), establishes new SOTA in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

Abstract: Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

TL;DR: FOD-S2R dataset bridges gap in aircraft fuel tank FOD detection with 3,114 real and 3,137 synthetic images, showing synthetic data improves real-world detection accuracy and reduces Sim2Real gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOD in aircraft fuel tanks poses critical safety risks, but existing datasets focus on external environments, lacking dedicated datasets for complex, enclosed fuel tank environments.

Method: Created FOD-S2R dataset with real images captured in controlled fuel tank replica and synthetic images generated using Unreal Engine, featuring varied FOVs, distances, lighting, colors, and object sizes.

Result: Benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection models showed that introducing synthetic data improves detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Synthetic data effectively enhances model performance and narrows the Sim2Real gap, providing valuable foundation for automated FOD detection systems in aviation maintenance.

Abstract: Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.

TL;DR: TRoVe is an automated method to discover error-inducing static feature biases in temporal vision-language models, improving bias detection by 28.6% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs may rely on static feature biases (like background or object features) rather than dynamic visual changes when making temporal predictions, leading to systematic errors that need identification before real-world deployment.

Method: TRoVe extracts candidate static features from annotated validation data and scores each feature based on (i) its effect on classification errors and (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on it for predictions.

Result: TRoVe achieved 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline in identifying error-inducing static feature biases across 101 trained temporal VLMs, and successfully surfaced previously-unknown biases in 7 off-the-shelf VLMs on 2 temporal tasks.

Conclusion: TRoVe effectively identifies static feature biases in temporal VLMs, and knowledge of these learned biases can help improve model performance at test time.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made great strides in addressing temporal understanding tasks, which involve characterizing visual changes across a sequence of images. However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

Motivation: Current aneurysm segmentation methods focus on image-based metrics but neglect practical effectiveness in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, which is critical for hemodynamic analysis.

Method: Created IAVS dataset with image-mask pairs and hemodynamic outcomes; developed two-stage evaluation benchmarks (global localization and fine-grained segmentation) with a simple two-stage framework as baseline; established standardized CFD applicability evaluation system.

Result: Comprehensive dataset with 641 3D MRA images and 587 annotations; developed evaluation benchmarks and baseline framework; created automated system for converting segmentation masks to CFD models for applicability assessment.

Conclusion: IAVS dataset addresses critical gap in aneurysm segmentation research by providing comprehensive data with CFD applicability focus, enabling development of clinically relevant techniques through standardized evaluation system.

Abstract: The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes.

Motivation: VLMs exhibit Western-centric biases that limit their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia, creating a need for inclusive model development that better serves diverse global populations.

Method: Created RICE-VL benchmark with 28,000+ human-curated VQA samples (True/False, Fill-in-Blank, open-ended) and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts. Proposed SEA-LAVE metric extension to assess textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification.

Conclusion: RICE-VL exposes VLMs' cultural comprehension limitations and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations, particularly in culturally diverse regions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedGrounder reformulates medical phrase grounding as a generalized task (GMPG) handling zero, one, or multiple scored regions per sentence, outperforming traditional REC approaches on multi-region and non-groundable phrases with fewer annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPG systems follow the REC paradigm assuming exactly one bounding box per phrase, but real radiology reports often contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, negations, and non-groundable phrases that violate this assumption.

Method: Introduced MedGrounder, a GMPG model with two-stage training: pre-training on report sentence-anatomy box alignment datasets, then fine-tuning on report sentence-human annotated box datasets.

Result: MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR, outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, and uses far fewer human box annotations.

Conclusion: MedGrounder successfully addresses limitations of traditional REC approaches for medical phrase grounding, can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining, and handles real-world report complexities.

Abstract: Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFS is a latent-space multi-path diffusion model using fuzzy rules to better handle heterogeneous image features, improve coordination between diffusion paths, and reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with image collections having significant feature differences, often failing to capture complex features and producing conflicting results. Existing multi-path approaches have inefficient coordination and high computational costs.

Method: DFS uses multiple diffusion paths each dedicated to specific image feature classes, employs rule-chain-based reasoning for dynamic steering and coordination, and introduces fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression to reduce computational costs.

Result: DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models, surpasses baselines in image quality and text-image alignment, and shows improved accuracy in comparing generated images to target references on LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO datasets.

Conclusion: DFS effectively addresses the limitations of diffusion models in handling heterogeneous image features through fuzzy rule-guided multi-path diffusion with improved coordination and reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.

TL;DR: Speed-RL uses reinforcement learning to accelerate pretrained Masked Generative Models by 3x while maintaining image quality, instead of using conventional distillation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Generative Models (MGMs) produce high-fidelity images but require many sampling steps, resulting in slow inference speed. Current acceleration methods use distillation approaches that treat acceleration as a distribution matching problem.

Method: Proposes Speed-RL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames acceleration as an RL problem. Combines quality reward (for image fidelity) with speed reward (for fewer steps) to finetune the base MGM using RL optimization.

Result: The method accelerates the base model by 3x while maintaining comparable image quality, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Speed-RL provides an effective alternative to conventional distillation methods for accelerating MGMs, achieving significant speed improvements without sacrificing image quality through a novel reinforcement learning approach.

Abstract: Masked Generative Models (MGM)s demonstrate strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method was able to accelerate the base model by a factor of 3x while maintaining comparable image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale benchmark shows deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain MRI has substantial performance variability (Dice 0.03-0.65), with reconstruction methods best for lesion segmentation but feature methods more robust to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress of deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI toward clinical translation, necessitating a standardized benchmark.

Method: Large-scale multi-center benchmark with 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2 healthy training scans, 92 validation scans, and 2,221 T1w/1,262 T2w test scans across diverse clinical cohorts. Systematic evaluation of reconstruction-based and feature-based methods under various distributional shifts.

Result: Dice segmentation performance varied widely (0.03-0.65). Reconstruction-based methods, especially diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved strongest lesion segmentation, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness to distribution shifts. Systematic biases observed: small/low-contrast lesions often missed, false positives varied with age/sex, scanner effects present. More training data yields only modest gains.

Conclusion: Current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are algorithmically limited rather than data-limited. Benchmark establishes foundation for future research, highlighting priorities: image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets for head and neck masses focus primarily on malignant lesions, overlooking other space-occupying conditions. There's a need for comprehensive datasets and benchmarks for broader head-and-neck mass segmentation.

Method: Created MasHeNe dataset with 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices with pixel-level annotations. Proposed WEMF model with tri-window enhancement for input enrichment and multi-frequency attention for skip connection fusion within a U-shaped Mamba backbone.

Result: WEMF achieved best performance on MasHeNe: Dice 70.45%, IoU 66.89%, NSD 72.33%, HD95 5.12 mm. Dataset provides benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets.

Conclusion: MasHeNe addresses the gap in head-and-neck mass datasets, WEMF shows strong performance, but the task remains challenging requiring further research. Dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Head and neck masses are space-occupying lesions that can compress the airway and esophagus and may affect nerves and blood vessels. Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/MasHeNe.git.

*Roy Velich,Arkadi Piven,David Bensaïd,Daniel Cremers,Thomas Dagès,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework that directly learns spectral bases from unstructured data without traditional operator construction or eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectral analysis requires operator selection, discretization, and eigensolvers, which are complex and make assumptions about data structure. The paper aims to create a data-driven alternative that works with unstructured data of any dimension.

Method: Train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing reconstruction error in the learned basis over a distribution of probe functions. The method learns spectral basis, sampling density, and eigenvalues simultaneously without explicit operator construction.

Result: The approach successfully learns meaningful spectral bases from point clouds on 3D surfaces and high-dimensional image manifolds, resembling Laplacian eigenfunctions without explicit operator construction.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional spectral analysis pipelines, enabling geometry processing on unstructured data in high-dimensional spaces without traditional operator assumptions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that directly learns a spectral basis for shape and manifold analysis from unstructured data, eliminating the need for traditional operator selection, discretization, and eigensolvers. Grounded in optimal-approximation theory, we train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing the reconstruction error in the learned basis over a chosen distribution of probe functions. For suitable distributions, they can be seen as an approximation of the Laplacian operator and its eigendecomposition, which are fundamental in geometry processing. Furthermore, our method recovers in a unified manner not only the spectral basis, but also the implicit metric's sampling density and the eigenvalues of the underlying operator. Notably, our unsupervised method makes no assumption on the data manifold, such as meshing or manifold dimensionality, allowing it to scale to arbitrary datasets of any dimension. On point clouds lying on surfaces in 3D and high-dimensional image manifolds, our approach yields meaningful spectral bases, that can resemble those of the Laplacian, without explicit construction of an operator. By replacing the traditional operator selection, construction, and eigendecomposition with a learning-based approach, our framework offers a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional pipelines. This opens new possibilities in geometry processing for unstructured data, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RoleMotion, a large-scale human motion dataset that encompasses a wealth of role-playing and functional motion data tailored to fit various specific scenes. Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSPE: Slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling that compresses multimodal histology and genomic data into compact, mutually distinctive slots to capture sparse prognostic events and improve cancer survival prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches struggle with efficient modeling of intra- and inter-modal interactions due to high-dimensional inputs. Critical prognostic events are sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them difficult to uncover despite being key determinants of patient outcomes.

Method: Proposes SlotSPE, a slot-based framework inspired by factorial coding. Compresses multimodal inputs (histology images and gene profiles) into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. These slots represent prognostic events and enable efficient modeling of complex interactions while allowing incorporation of biological priors.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cancer benchmarks, achieving overall improvement of 2.9%. Shows robustness under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

Conclusion: SlotSPE effectively addresses challenges in multimodal cancer survival prediction by capturing sparse prognostic events through slot-based representation, leading to improved performance, robustness, and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The integration of histology images and gene profiles has shown great promise for improving survival prediction in cancer. However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamGaze is the first benchmark evaluating MLLMs' ability to use human gaze signals for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos, revealing significant performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning but don't measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals, which is crucial for realistic applications like AR glasses that need to anticipate user intentions.

Method: Developed StreamGaze benchmark with gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks. Created a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction to produce spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs.

Result: Substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance across all StreamGaze tasks, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with gaze-based reasoning, and future models need to develop better capabilities for gaze-guided streaming video understanding. The benchmark and data will be publicly released to support continued research in this area.

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.

### [153] [OmniFD: A Unified Model for Versatile Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01128)
*Haotian Liu,Haoyu Chen,Chenhui Pan,You Hu,Guoying Zhao,Xiaobai Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFD is a unified framework that addresses four face forgery detection tasks (image/video classification, spatial/temporal localization) in a single model, reducing redundancy and improving performance through multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use task-specific models with independent architectures, causing computational redundancy and ignoring correlations across related face forgery detection tasks.

Method: Three components: (1) shared Swin Transformer encoder for unified 4D spatiotemporal representations, (2) cross-task interaction module with learnable queries for attention-based inter-task reasoning, (3) lightweight decoding heads for task-specific predictions.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks with high efficiency: 4.63% video classification improvement with image data, 63% parameter reduction, 50% training time reduction compared to task-specific models.

Conclusion: OmniFD establishes a practical, generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection by unifying images, videos, and four tasks in one framework with multi-task learning benefits.

Abstract: Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications. The source code is made available at https://github.com/haotianll/OmniFD.

*Juanxi Tian,Siyuan Li,Conghui He,Lijun Wu,Cheng Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Envision benchmark evaluates text-to-multi-image generation for causal event progression, revealing limitations of current models in spatiotemporal consistency and world knowledge internalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models focus on single-image generation, leading to overfitting to static patterns and inability to model dynamic processes over time, hindering true world knowledge internalization.

Method: Proposed Envision benchmark with 1,000 four-stage prompts across six domains, grounded in world knowledge and spatiotemporal causality, plus Envision-Score metric for multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics evaluation.

Result: Specialized T2I models excel at aesthetics but lack world knowledge; unified multimodal models show better causal narrative coherence but still lag behind closed-source models and struggle with spatiotemporal consistency.

Conclusion: Focus on single-image generation promotes static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling, limiting world knowledge internalization and multi-frame reasoning capabilities in current models.

Abstract: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

### [155] [Weakly Supervised Continuous Micro-Expression Intensity Estimation Using Temporal Deep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01145)
*Riyadh Mohammed Almushrafy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset) instead of frame-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focuses on discrete micro-expression classification, but continuous intensity evolution over time is understudied due to lack of frame-level intensity labels, making fully supervised regression impractical.

Method: Uses triangular prior to convert sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories, then trains lightweight temporal regression model (ResNet18 encoder + bidirectional GRU) to predict frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. Requires no frame-level annotation and uses consistent preprocessing pipeline.

Result: Strong temporal agreement with pseudo-intensity trajectories on SAMM (Spearman: 0.9014, Kendall: 0.7999) and CASME II (Spearman: 0.9116, Kendall: 0.8168 without apex-ranking term), outperforming frame-wise baseline. Ablation confirms temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are crucial.

Conclusion: First unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations, effectively capturing rise-apex-fall dynamics of micro-facial movements without labor-intensive frame-level labeling.

Abstract: Micro-facial expressions are brief and involuntary facial movements that reflect genuine emotional states. While most prior work focuses on classifying discrete micro-expression categories, far fewer studies address the continuous evolution of intensity over time. Progress in this direction is limited by the lack of frame-level intensity labels, which makes fully supervised regression impractical.
  We propose a unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset). A simple triangular prior converts sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories, and a lightweight temporal regression model that combines a ResNet18 encoder with a bidirectional GRU predicts frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. The method requires no frame-level annotation effort and is applied consistently across datasets through a single preprocessing and temporal alignment pipeline.
  Experiments on SAMM and CASME II show strong temporal agreement with the pseudo-intensity trajectories. On SAMM, the model reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.9014 and a Kendall correlation of 0.7999, outperforming a frame-wise baseline. On CASME II, it achieves up to 0.9116 and 0.8168, respectively, when trained without the apex-ranking term. Ablation studies confirm that temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are central to capturing the rise-apex-fall dynamics of micro-facial movements.
  To our knowledge, this is the first unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations.

*Zihua Liu,Hiroki Sakuma,Masatoshi Okutomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSRD++ is a weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the need for 3D annotations by using neural-field-based volumetric rendering with only 2D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D object detection methods heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which require labor-intensive labeling from LiDAR point clouds. There's a need for approaches that can learn from weaker supervision.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Multi-view 3D autolabeling using signed distance fields (SDFs) with instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering, decomposing SDFs into cuboid SDFs and residual distance fields, modeling dynamic objects with velocity attributes and confidence scores, and using 3D attribute initialization. 2) Using optimized 3D bounding boxes as pseudo labels to train monocular 3D detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 dataset show VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: VSRD++ successfully demonstrates that weakly supervised monocular 3D object detection is feasible by leveraging neural-field-based volumetric rendering with only 2D supervision, eliminating the need for expensive 3D annotations while achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: TabletopGen: Training-free framework for generating diverse, interactive 3D tabletop scenes from reference images, with novel pose/scale alignment and collision-free assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text/image-driven 3D scene generation methods focus on large-scale scenes and struggle with high-density layouts and complex spatial relations of tabletop scenes needed for embodied AI and robotic manipulation.

Method: Reference image input (can be from text-to-image model) → instance segmentation/completion → per-instance 3D reconstruction → canonical coordinate alignment → novel two-stage pose/scale estimation (Differentiable Rotation Optimizer + Top-view Spatial Alignment) → collision-free assembly into simulation-ready scene.

Result: State-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility; generates realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity.

Conclusion: TabletopGen enables high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D tabletop scene generation essential for embodied AI applications like robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D simulated tabletop scenes is essential for embodied AI--especially for robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis. However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.

*Yangbangyan Jiang,Qianqian Xu,Huiyang Shao,Zhiyong Yang,Shilong Bao,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel minimax reformulations for partial AUC optimization with vanishing approximation gaps, linear computational complexity, and tight generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial AUC is crucial for imbalanced classification with decision constraints, but existing optimization methods suffer from approximation errors and scalability issues.

Method: Two instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with asymptotically vanishing gap, another unbiased with more variables; uses threshold learning and smoothing techniques.

Result: Linear per-iteration complexity, O(ε^{-1/3}) convergence rate, tight generalization bound showing O(α^{-1}n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}n_-^{-1}) dependency.

Conclusion: Proposed methods close approximation gap in PAUC optimization with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generation models degrade when extended to multiple subjects, struggling with subject consistency and text prompt adherence due to lack of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined training strategies.

Method: 1) Scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline using single-subject models; 2) Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards; 3) Refined reinforcement learning stage; 4) New benchmark with 7 subsets across 3 dimensions for evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation, with improved subject consistency and text controllability.

Conclusion: The proposed PSR framework successfully addresses multi-subject personalization challenges through scalable data generation and reinforcement learning with specialized rewards, establishing a new benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR

TL;DR: TRivia: Self-supervised fine-tuning method for table recognition using unlabeled images, achieving SOTA with TRivia-3B model


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised table recognition requires costly labeled data, creating a gap between proprietary and open-source models. Need privacy-compliant, resource-efficient approach that doesn't rely on human annotations.

Method: Self-supervised fine-tuning using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Automatically identifies effective unlabeled samples, uses QA-based reward mechanism with attention-guided question generation, and closed-loop optimization without labeled data.

Result: TRivia-3B model surpasses existing systems (Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks, becoming state-of-the-art open-source table recognition model.

Conclusion: TRivia enables VLMs to autonomously learn table recognition from unlabeled images, bridging the performance gap between proprietary and open-source models while eliminating need for costly annotations.

Abstract: Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.

TL;DR: Computer vision system measures viscosity by analyzing optical distortions in mixing fluid surfaces, achieving 0.113 MAE in log viscosity units and 81% classification accuracy with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional viscometers are invasive and require controlled lab environments that don't match real process conditions, creating a need for non-invasive, automation-ready viscosity measurement solutions.

Method: Computer vision system infers viscosity by analyzing how fixed background patterns become optically distorted as light refracts through mixing-driven, continuously deforming fluid surfaces, using multi-pattern strategy for robustness and incorporating uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m² s⁻¹ units for regression, up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction, with performance improvements using multi-pattern strategy and uncertainty quantification for reliability.

Conclusion: The stand-off computer-vision-based viscometer provides a practical, automation-ready alternative to conventional methods, enabling non-invasive viscosity measurement in real process conditions with confidence estimates.

Abstract: Viscosity measurement is essential for process monitoring and autonomous laboratory operation, yet conventional viscometers remain invasive and require controlled laboratory environments that differ substantially from real process conditions. We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Although performance declines for classes with closely clustered viscosity values, a multi-pattern strategy improves robustness by providing enriched visual cues. To ensure sensor reliability, we incorporate uncertainty quantification, enabling viscosity predictions with confidence estimates. This stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnMobileNet++ is a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture for retinal image analysis that combines dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware features, transformer blocks for global context, and retinal pretraining to achieve state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs like nnMobileNet struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns in retinal images, despite vascular features being critical for clinical diagnosis. There's a need for lightweight yet more effective architectures that can handle these complex patterns.

Method: nnMobileNet++ integrates three key components: 1) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, 2) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and 3) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. This creates a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations.

Result: Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification show that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: nnMobileNet++ demonstrates strong potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis, successfully addressing the limitations of purely convolutional architectures while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Retinal imaging is a critical, non-invasive modality for the early detection and monitoring of ocular and systemic diseases. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.

Motivation: Existing AI models for sonar image analysis over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization despite high accuracy on training data. Need to reduce background bias and improve model robustness.

Method: Two-module framework: (1) Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) extends triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias, (2) Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF) provides visual insights into what the model has forgotten and adapts LIME explainer for unlearning evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real and synthetic sonar datasets show significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses seafloor bias in sonar image analysis, improving generalization while maintaining interpretability through targeted unlearning and explainability mechanisms.

Abstract: Acoustic sonar image analysis plays a critical role in object detection and classification, with applications in both civilian and defense domains. Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentiable rendering methods (NeRF/3DGS) face challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity and limited practicality for real-time 3D reconstruction.

Method: Proposes EGG-Fusion with robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping using an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise for high-precision surface reconstruction.

Result: Achieves 0.6cm surface reconstruction error on Replica and ScanNet++ benchmarks, representing over 20% improvement in accuracy compared to SOTA GS-based methods while maintaining real-time processing at 24 FPS.

Conclusion: EGG-Fusion establishes itself as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems, effectively addressing both real-time computation and sensor noise challenges.

Abstract: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

*Thisara Rathnayaka,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBT-Former improves temporal action localization by enhancing ActionFormer with a scaled Transformer backbone, cross-scale FPN, and boundary distribution regression head for better handling of fuzzy boundaries and multi-scale context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage anchor-free models like ActionFormer struggle with precise localization of actions with ambiguous temporal boundaries and effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information in videos.

Method: Three core contributions: 1) Scaled Transformer backbone with more attention heads and expanded MLP dimension, 2) Cross-scale feature pyramid network with top-down pathway and lateral connections, 3) Novel boundary distribution regression head inspired by Generalized Focal Loss for probability distribution learning.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on ActivityNet-1.3.

Conclusion: TBT-Former advances Transformer-based architectures for temporal action localization by addressing boundary uncertainty and multi-scale feature fusion, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or "fuzzy" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCText is a training-free method for accurate visual text generation using divide-and-conquer strategy with attention masks and localized noise initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention, leading to poor text rendering accuracy.

Method: Divide-and-conquer approach: decomposes prompts, assigns text segments to regions, uses Text-Focus and Context-Expansion attention masks during denoising, plus Localized Noise Initialization.

Result: Achieves best text accuracy on single- and multi-sentence benchmarks without compromising image quality, with lowest generation latency.

Conclusion: DCText effectively solves the long/multiple text generation problem in text-to-image models through a training-free, computationally efficient divide-and-conquer approach.

Abstract: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

TL;DR: Gaussian Swaying: A surface-based aerodynamic simulation framework using 3D Gaussians that unifies simulation and rendering for realistic motion effects like swaying branches and rippling flags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic aerodynamic effects in vision and graphics (like swaying branches, rippling flags, rocking boats) with a more efficient approach than existing mesh-based or particle-based methods.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussians to model surfaces continuously, creating Gaussian patches that serve as a unified representation for both simulation (force computation) and rendering (normal-based shading).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency on synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics, demonstrating scalable realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

Conclusion: Gaussian Swaying offers an efficient, fine-grained aerodynamic simulation framework that unifies dynamics and rendering on the same representation, enabling realistic motion effects with better scalability than existing approaches.

Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuroimaging data exhibits high heterogeneity in quality (from well-structured to severely distorted scans), raising questions about whether noisy/low-quality scans can meaningfully contribute to pretraining or hinder model learning in domain foundation models.

Method: Systematically explore role of data quality level in pretraining by performing pretraining on datasets with different quality levels, then fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts.

Result: Significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations for using heterogeneous quality data in pretraining.

Conclusion: Highlights gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

Abstract: Large-scale brain imaging datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for developing domain foundation models through pretraining. However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task with IVCR-200K dataset and MLLM framework for multi-turn conversational video retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems lack meaningful interaction with users and can't meet personalization needs of over 80% of users; need multi-turn conversational retrieval.

Method: Introduces IVCR-200K dataset (bilingual, multi-turn, conversational) and proposes comprehensive MLLM-based framework supporting multiple interaction modes with explainable solutions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of both the dataset and the proposed framework for interactive video retrieval.

Conclusion: IVCR task and dataset address limitations of one-way retrieval, enabling more realistic conversational interactions between users and video retrieval systems.

Abstract: In recent years, significant developments have been made in both video retrieval and video moment retrieval tasks, which respectively retrieve complete videos or moments for a given text query. These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful "interaction" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to help users interact in several modes with more explainable solutions. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and framework.

*Pei Yang,Yepeng Liu,Kelly Peng,Yuan Gao,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenPure is a Diffusion Transformer framework that removes watermarks by decomposing images into visual and structural tokens, then using them to conditionally generate watermark-free versions while preserving content consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital watermarking is crucial for ownership proof of replicable content (AI-generated/virtual assets), but robust watermark removal is needed for various legitimate use cases. Existing methods struggle with balancing thorough watermark destruction and content consistency preservation.

Method: TokenPure reframes watermark removal as conditional generation using a Diffusion Transformer. It decomposes watermarked images into two token sets: visual tokens (texture) and structural tokens (geometry). These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process to synthesize watermark-free images, bypassing initial watermark-carrying noise entirely.

Result: TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and content consistency across comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: TokenPure successfully solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency through token-based conditional reconstruction, providing an effective framework for watermark removal while maintaining structural integrity and fine-grained consistency.

Abstract: In the digital economy era, digital watermarking serves as a critical basis for ownership proof of massive replicable content, including AI-generated and other virtual assets. Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

Conclusion: Combining ensemble learning with explainable AI enables highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment, potentially transforming stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management through data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions.

Abstract: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

*Yexin Liu,Wen-Jie Shu,Zile Huang,Haoze Zheng,Yueze Wang,Manyuan Zhang,Ser-Nam Lim,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVid is a training-free framework that improves semantic adherence in text-guided image-to-video generation by modulating attention scaling and scheduling guidance to reduce semantic negligence while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TI2V methods struggle with semantic negligence - failing to properly handle fine-grained prompt semantics involving substantial image transformations like object addition, deletion, or modification. A pilot study showed that Gaussian blur improves semantic adherence by creating clearer foreground-background separation in attention maps.

Method: AlignVid consists of two components: 1) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM) that directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and 2) Guidance Scheduling (GS) that applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. The framework also introduces OmitI2V benchmark with 367 human-annotated samples for evaluating semantic negligence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid enhances semantic fidelity in TI2V generation while limiting aesthetic degradation. The method improves adherence to fine-grained prompt semantics involving object addition, deletion, and modification scenarios.

Conclusion: AlignVid provides an effective training-free solution to address semantic negligence in TI2V generation through minimal intervention in attention mechanisms, balancing improved prompt adherence with maintained visual quality.

Abstract: Text-guided image-to-video (TI2V) generation has recently achieved remarkable progress, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and temporal coherence. However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multi-Talker systems (animating multiple subjects simultaneously) suffer from quality degradation and lack proper evaluation metrics, limiting their practical application despite offering richer interactivity and immersion.

Method: Created THQA-MT dataset with 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated talking humans from 15 methods using 400 real portraits. Developed EvalTalker framework that assesses global quality, human characteristics, identity consistency, and integrates Qwen-Sync for multimodal synchrony perception.

Result: Identified 12 common distortion types through subjective experiments. EvalTalker achieved superior correlation with subjective scores compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: THQA-MT dataset and EvalTalker framework provide robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation, addressing current quality assessment limitations.

Abstract: Speech-driven Talking Human (TH) generation, commonly known as "Talker," currently faces limitations in multi-subject driving capabilities. Extending this paradigm to "Multi-Talker," capable of animating multiple subjects simultaneously, introduces richer interactivity and stronger immersion in audiovisual communication. However, current Multi-Talkers still exhibit noticeable quality degradation caused by technical limitations, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online. Through subjective experiments, we analyze perceptual discrepancies among different Multi-Talkers and identify 12 common types of distortion. Furthermore, we introduce EvalTalker, a novel TH quality assessment framework. This framework possesses the ability to perceive global quality, human characteristics, and identity consistency, while integrating Qwen-Sync to perceive multimodal synchrony. Experimental results demonstrate that EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores, providing a robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: InternVideo-Next introduces a two-stage pretraining framework with Encoder-Predictor-Decoder architecture to bridge the gap between pixel-level reconstruction and semantic abstraction in video representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-text pretraining relies on noisy synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, while masked video modeling struggles with convergence and semantic conflicts. There's a need to better capture implicit world knowledge like object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues.

Method: Proposes Encoder-Predictor-Decoder framework with two-stage pretraining: Stage 1 uses conditional diffusion decoder with image-level semantic priors to bridge pixel fidelity with semantic abstraction; Stage 2 learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets to mitigate shortcut learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks when trained on public, unlabeled videos, providing a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

Conclusion: The proposed disentangled architecture and two-stage pretraining scheme successfully address architectural issues in video representation learning, enabling better semantic consistency while preserving details for world knowledge modeling.

Abstract: Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paragraph-level handwritten text recognition remains challenging for low-resource languages like Hindi and Urdu that lack comprehensive linguistic resources, requiring robust OCR systems for these scripts.

Method: ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture: Vision Transformer extracts visual features, Transformer decoder generates text sequences, pre-trained RoBERTa language model refines output. Uses DeiT for masked image modeling and implicit line segmentation processing paragraph images line by line.

Result: Achieved benchmark results: 96.24% on NUST-UHWR, 92.05% on PUCIT-OUHL, 94.80% on Parimal-Urdu, and 80.64% on Hindi dataset. Outperformed state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

Conclusion: BharatOCR provides an effective segmentation-free approach for paragraph-level handwritten text recognition in low-resource languages, demonstrating superior performance through combined visual feature extraction, sequence generation, and language model refinement.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenBox: A two-stage automatic annotation pipeline using 2D vision foundation models to generate high-quality 3D bounding boxes without self-training, addressing annotation costs and unseen object recognition in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised 3D object detection methods have limitations: they uniformly annotate 3D boxes, ignore objects' physical states, require multiple self-training iterations (leading to suboptimal quality and high computational cost), and struggle with annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects in autonomous driving.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Cross-modal instance alignment associates 2D image instance cues from vision foundation models with 3D point clouds; 2) Instance categorization by rigidity/motion state followed by adaptive bounding box generation using class-specific size statistics.

Result: Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset, Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baseline methods.

Conclusion: OpenBox provides a more efficient and accurate solution for automatic 3D bounding box annotation without requiring self-training, addressing key challenges in autonomous driving annotation pipelines.

Abstract: Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to pedestrian and cyclist road safety, creating a need for effective detection systems.

Method: Uses a single earbud and paired phone with novel 3D object tracking algorithm combining Kalman filter trajectory estimation and reinforcement learning-based optimal image sampling. Corrects for head movements using pitch/yaw angle estimation to align coordinate systems.

Result: Lightweight system with ultra-low power consumption (29.8 mW earbud, 702.6 mW smartphone) and accurate hazard detection with low false positive ratio (4.90%) and false negative ratio (1.47%).

Conclusion: BlinkBud provides an effective, low-power solution for detecting approaching hazards from behind, significantly improving road safety for vulnerable road users.

Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

*Sheng Liu,Tianyu Luan,Phani Nuney,Xuelu Feng,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Shape-Realism Alignment Metric (SRAM) using LLMs to evaluate 3D shape realism without ground truth, validated on new RealismGrading dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D shape evaluation requires ground truth references, but realism assessment often doesn't need reference shapes. Need for metric that aligns with human perception of realism without ground truth dependency.

Method: 1) Encode 3D meshes into language token space, 2) Use LLM as bridge between shape information and realism evaluation, 3) Design dedicated realism decoder to align LLM output with human perception, 4) Create RealismGrading dataset with human-annotated realism scores from 16 algorithms across diverse objects.

Result: Metric correlates well with human perceptions, outperforms existing methods, shows good generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects.

Conclusion: Proposed Shape-Realism Alignment Metric effectively evaluates 3D shape realism without ground truth, leveraging LLMs to bridge shape information with human perception, validated on comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: 3D generation and reconstruction techniques have been widely used in computer games, film, and other content creation areas. As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability.

TL;DR: TGE is a new 3D mesh fidelity evaluation method that jointly uses geometry and color information without rendering, outperforming existing methods on real-world distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D evaluation metrics fail to align with human perception - Chamfer Distance doesn't match human evaluation, rendering-based methods have incomplete coverage and viewpoint sensitivity, and most methods are trained on synthetic distortions creating a domain gap with real-world scenarios.

Method: Textured Geometry Evaluation (TGE) directly analyzes 3D meshes with texture without rendering, jointly using geometry and color information to calculate fidelity compared to a reference colored shape. The method is trained on a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions.

Result: TGE outperforms both rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion datasets, demonstrating better alignment with human perception of 3D shape fidelity.

Conclusion: TGE provides a more accurate and human-aligned evaluation method for textured 3D models by directly analyzing mesh geometry and color without rendering dependencies, addressing limitations of existing metrics in real-world applications.

Abstract: Textured high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for games, AR/VR, and film, but human-aligned evaluation methods still fall behind despite recent advances in 3D reconstruction and generation. Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.

TL;DR: ReInversion: A training-free, two-stage denoising method for exemplar-guided image editing that achieves SOTA performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EIE methods require expensive large-scale pre-training, while standard inversion techniques are suboptimal - leading to poor quality and inefficiency in image editing tasks.

Method: Two-stage denoising process: first conditioned on source image, then on reference image, plus Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) to constrain edits to target regions while preserving background structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead, as demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

Conclusion: ReInversion provides an effective and efficient training-free solution for exemplar-guided image editing, overcoming limitations of both pre-training approaches and standard inversion techniques.

Abstract: Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) aims to modify a source image according to a visual reference. Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead.

Conclusion: PointNet4D provides an efficient, lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings, enabling real-time processing of streaming point cloud videos while maintaining strong performance across various applications including robotics.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D environments-3D space evolving over time-is critical for robotic and interactive systems. These applications demand systems that can process streaming point cloud video in real-time, often under resource constraints, while also benefiting from past and present observations when available. However, current 4D backbone networks rely heavily on spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers, which are often computationally intensive and poorly suited to real-time applications. We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains.

*Seungho Choi,Jeahun Sung,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRAMER is a plug-and-play training scheme for diffusion-based Real-ISR that addresses high-frequency detail under-reconstruction through frequency-aware feature distillation with contrastive losses and adaptive modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for Real-ISR under-reconstruct high-frequency details due to low-frequency bias and a "low-first, high-later" hierarchy in their depth-wise processing, despite surpassing GANs in perceptual quality.

Method: FRAMER uses final-layer feature maps to teach intermediate layers via FFT-based frequency decomposition. It applies Intra Contrastive Loss for low-frequency structure stabilization and Inter Contrastive Loss for high-frequency detail sharpening, with Frequency-based Adaptive Weight and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation for adaptive signal reweighting and distillation gating.

Result: FRAMER consistently improves both distortion metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ) across U-Net and DiT backbones including Stable Diffusion 2 and 3, with ablations validating the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

Conclusion: FRAMER effectively addresses the high-frequency detail reconstruction problem in diffusion-based Real-ISR through frequency-aware feature distillation, providing a plug-and-play solution that works across different backbone architectures without changing inference.

Abstract: Real-image super-resolution (Real-ISR) seeks to recover HR images from LR inputs with mixed, unknown degradations. While diffusion models surpass GANs in perceptual quality, they under-reconstruct high-frequency (HF) details due to a low-frequency (LF) bias and a depth-wise "low-first, high-later" hierarchy. We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity. Across U-Net and DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2, 3), FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ). Ablations validate the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDiff4STR introduces Mask Diffusion Models to Scene Text Recognition with two key improvements: better training-inference alignment via six noising strategies, and a token-replacement noise mechanism to correct overconfident predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask Diffusion Models offer flexible efficiency-accuracy balance for vision-language tasks, but vanilla MDMs lag behind auto-regressive models in STR accuracy despite being more efficient. The paper aims to bridge this gap by addressing two key challenges: training-inference noising gap and overconfident predictions during inference.

Method: MDiff4STR enhances Mask Diffusion Models with two strategies: 1) Six noising strategies to better align training with inference behavior, and 2) A token-replacement noise mechanism that provides non-mask noise to encourage reconsideration of overconfident but incorrect predictions.

Result: MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models across diverse benchmarks (irregular, artistic, occluded, Chinese text), surpassing state-of-the-art auto-regressive models in accuracy while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

Conclusion: MDiff4STR successfully bridges the accuracy gap between Mask Diffusion Models and auto-regressive models for Scene Text Recognition, achieving superior accuracy with efficient inference, making it a promising approach for diverse STR scenarios.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs) for vision-language tasks, owing to their flexible balance of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs frequently make errors in complex video reasoning, but existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of their error correction capabilities, making it hard to identify weaknesses and improve performance.

Method: Created ViRectify benchmark with 30K+ instances using AI-assisted annotation with human verification. Proposed trajectory evidence-driven correction framework with step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction.

Result: GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy, showing ViRectify is challenging. Qwen2.5-VL-7B consistently outperforms 72B variants using the proposed framework. Analysis reveals systematic asymmetries in error correction across models.

Conclusion: ViRectify provides a comprehensive testbed for evaluating MLLMs' video reasoning error correction capabilities and offers a valuable data resource for reflection learning, advancing evaluation of advanced MLLMs.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.

*Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Pu Cao,Yonghao Dang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResDiT is a training-free method that enables high-resolution image synthesis with Diffusion Transformers by fixing position embedding scaling issues and adding local enhancement mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained DiTs struggle with high-resolution image synthesis, suffering from spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Existing solutions require complex pipelines with base-resolution denoising guidance, which is inefficient.

Method: ResDiT addresses two key issues: 1) PE scaling technique to correct positional encoding when extrapolating to higher resolutions, preventing layout collapse; 2) Local-enhancement mechanism using base-resolution local attention with patch-level fusion and Gaussian-weighted splicing to eliminate grid artifacts.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks including spatially controlled generation.

Conclusion: ResDiT provides an efficient, training-free solution for scaling Diffusion Transformers to high resolutions by addressing fundamental positional encoding issues and enhancing local details, outperforming complex pipeline-based approaches.

Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.

TL;DR: Clipomaly: First CLIP-based open-world anomaly segmentation method that detects unknown objects and assigns human-interpretable names without anomaly training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to assign meaningful labels to unknown regions and can't handle unconstrained unknown classes in autonomous driving scenarios. Open-vocabulary methods require fixed vocabularies and can't adapt to anomalies.

Method: Zero-shot approach leveraging CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names. Dynamically extends vocabulary at inference time without retraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Clipomaly enables robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions, making it suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

Motivation: Existing 3D human avatar animation approaches have two main problems: 1) template construction requires extensive skeletal rigging and produces artifacts for specific poses, and 2) target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), undermining animation realism.

Method: A unified learning-based framework with two phases: 1) Uses a U-Net architecture to decouple texture and pose information in a feed-forward process for fast template generation, and 2) employs a data-driven refinement technique to enhance structural integrity during deformation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with optimal balance between efficiency and quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses both template construction inefficiencies and deformation artifacts in 3D human avatar animation, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Omer Sela,Michael Chertok,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CourtMotion: A spatiotemporal framework using skeletal tracking data with Graph Neural Networks and Transformers to predict basketball events like passes, shots, and steals by analyzing both physical motion patterns and their tactical significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional position-only approaches fail to capture crucial basketball indicators like body orientation, defensive stance, and shooting preparation motions. There's a need to understand both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in game context for better event prediction.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Graph Neural Networks process skeletal tracking data to capture nuanced motion patterns, 2) Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms models player interactions. Event projection heads explicitly connect player movements to basketball events.

Result: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models. Consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks including pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition.

Conclusion: CourtMotion provides a powerful foundation for multiple downstream basketball analytics tasks by effectively modeling both physical motion patterns and their tactical purposes, significantly outperforming traditional position-only approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents CourtMotion, a spatiotemporal modeling framework for analyzing and predicting game events and plays as they develop in professional basketball. Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.

TL;DR: ChronosObserver is a training-free method for generating 3D-consistent, time-synchronized multi-view videos using World State Hyperspace and guided sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation models struggle with 3D consistency and time synchronization across multiple views, which is crucial for 4D world generation. Current approaches using data augmentation or test-time optimization have limited generalization and scalability issues.

Method: Proposes ChronosObserver with two key components: 1) World State Hyperspace to represent spatiotemporal constraints of 4D scenes, and 2) Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize diffusion sampling trajectories across multiple views using the hyperspace representation.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view video generation without requiring training or fine-tuning of diffusion models.

Conclusion: ChronosObserver provides an effective training-free solution for generating synchronized multi-view videos with 3D consistency, addressing limitations of existing approaches while maintaining scalability and generalization.

Abstract: Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.

Motivation: To develop an automated, mostly unsupervised method for extracting curves and 1D structures from images, addressing the challenge of finding optimal paths between multiple possible endpoints.

Method: Uses variational approach with energy discretization and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields; employs bi-level minimization; extends to curvature-dependent energies by lifting curves to position-orientation space with sub-Riemannian/Finslerian metrics.

Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for extracting curves between a list of possible endpoints, based on the discretization of an energy and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields. It is used to design a bi-level minimization approach to automatically extract curves and 1D structures from an image, which is mostly unsupervised.

TL;DR: ELVIS is a framework that adapts video instance segmentation models to low-light conditions using synthetic degradations and enhancement techniques, achieving +3.7AP improvement on low-light datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video instance segmentation in low-light is challenging due to noise, blur, low-contrast, lack of annotated datasets, and limitations of current synthetic pipelines. Existing VIS methods perform poorly on low-light videos even after fine-tuning.

Method: ELVIS framework includes: 1) unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline modeling spatial and temporal degradations, 2) calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net), and 3) enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features.

Result: Improves performance by up to +3.7AP on synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ELVIS enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios by addressing key challenges in synthetic data generation and degradation modeling.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) for low-light content remains highly challenging for both humans and machines alike, due to adverse imaging conditions including noise, blur and low-contrast. The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios. ELVIS comprises an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline that models both spatial and temporal degradations, a calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net) and an enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features. ELVIS improves performances by up to \textbf{+3.7AP} on the synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRCSM: A novel single-source domain generalization method for medical image segmentation that uses semantic-aware random convolution during training and intensity mapping at test-time to bridge domain gaps without target domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization for medical image segmentation, where models trained on one domain (e.g., CT) need to generalize to different domains (e.g., MR) without adaptation or access to target domain data during training.

Method: Proposes SRCSM with two key components: 1) Training-time diversification via semantic-aware random convolution that augments different image regions differently based on annotation labels, and 2) Test-time intensity mapping to make target domain images similar to source domain data.

Result: Outperforms previous DG techniques in most experiments across cross-modality and cross-center settings for abdominal, whole-heart, and prostate segmentation. Achieves state-of-the-art performance and even matches in-domain baseline performance in several settings.

Conclusion: SRCSM establishes new state-of-the-art for domain generalization in medical image segmentation, effectively bridging domain gaps without requiring target domain data, and shows promising results even in challenging cross-phase and cross-hardware settings.

Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.

TL;DR: QuantumCanvas is a multimodal benchmark dataset focusing on two-body quantum systems as fundamental units of matter, using visual representations of orbital physics to enable more physically transferable machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular and materials machine learning models lack physical transferability because they fit correlations across whole molecules/crystals rather than learning the fundamental quantum interactions between atomic pairs that govern bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling.

Method: Created a large-scale multimodal benchmark with 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties, paired with ten-channel image representations derived from orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections that encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates.

Result: Achieved mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN, with DimeNet attaining 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE. Multimodal fusion achieved 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas improved convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets like QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM.

Conclusion: QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities, unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning to address the physical transferability gap in molecular and materials machine learning.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

### [194] [FlashVGGT: Efficient and Scalable Visual Geometry Transformers with Compressed Descriptor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01540)
*Zipeng Wang,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVGGT is an efficient 3D reconstruction model that replaces VGGT's quadratic self-attention with descriptor-based cross-attention, achieving similar accuracy with 90.7% faster inference for 1,000 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models like VGGT use full self-attention over all image tokens, which suffers from poor scalability due to quadratic complexity and large token counts in long image sequences.

Method: FlashVGGT introduces a descriptor-based attention mechanism that compresses spatial information from each frame into compact descriptor tokens, then computes global attention as cross-attention between image tokens and this smaller descriptor set. It also uses a chunk-recursive mechanism for online inference over long sequences by reusing cached descriptors.

Result: FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scales efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Conclusion: FlashVGGT provides an efficient alternative to VGGT that maintains reconstruction quality while dramatically improving scalability through descriptor-based attention and chunk-recursive processing.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head and neck abscesses are serious infections requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. Accurate imaging detection and delineation are crucial for clinical decision-making, but there's a lack of comprehensive annotated datasets for developing automated segmentation models.

Method: Created AbscessHeNe dataset with 4,926 contrast-enhanced CT slices containing clinically confirmed abscesses, each with pixel-level annotations and clinical metadata. Evaluated baseline performance using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based segmentation architectures.

Result: Best model achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.39, Intersection-over-Union of 0.27, and Normalized Surface Distance of 0.67, indicating the segmentation task is challenging and requires further research.

Conclusion: AbscessHeNe provides a valuable resource for developing abscess segmentation models and future applications in content-based indexing and case retrieval. The modest baseline performance highlights the complexity of abscess segmentation and the need for continued research in this area.

Abstract: Abscesses in the head and neck represent an acute infectious process that can potentially lead to sepsis or mortality if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Accurate detection and delineation of these lesions on imaging are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical intervention. In this study, we introduce AbscessHeNe, a curated and comprehensively annotated dataset comprising 4,926 contrast-enhanced CT slices with clinically confirmed head and neck abscesses. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of robust semantic segmentation models that can accurately delineate abscess boundaries and evaluate deep neck space involvement, thereby supporting informed clinical decision-making. To establish performance baselines, we evaluate several state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. The highest-performing model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.39, Intersection-over-Union of 0.27, and Normalized Surface Distance of 0.67, indicating the challenges of this task and the need for further research. Beyond segmentation, AbscessHeNe is structured for future applications in content-based multimedia indexing and case-based retrieval. Each CT scan is linked with pixel-level annotations and clinical metadata, providing a foundation for building intelligent retrieval systems and supporting knowledge-driven clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth misalignment persists between upper and lower pad sets in oil-based mud microresistivity imagers even after velocity correction, requiring better alignment methods for accurate geological interpretation.

Method: Uses Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm with combined feature set of one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and original signal as shape descriptor to construct morphologically sensitive distance matrix for alignment.

Result: Method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling in field tests, and provides flexible framework for feature extension.

Conclusion: ShapeDTW-based depth matching with HOG1D features effectively solves depth misalignment in OBM microresistivity imaging, offering accurate alignment and adaptability for various geological features.

Abstract: In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised CIR methods require expensive triplet annotations, motivating zero-shot solutions. Existing zero-shot approaches struggle with the vision-language modality gap, needing more effective and data-efficient solutions.

Method: Proposes Fusion-Diff with: 1) multimodal fusion feature editing in joint vision-language space to narrow modality gap, 2) lightweight Control-Adapter fine-tuned on only 200K synthetic samples for data efficiency.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, CIRCO). Visualizations enhance interpretability of fused multimodal representations.

Conclusion: Fusion-Diff effectively addresses the vision-language modality gap in zero-shot CIR with high data efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance through multimodal fusion and lightweight adaptation.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables fine-grained visual search by combining a reference image with a textual modification. While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Training (TTT) shows promise for efficient sequence modeling but lacks comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines for visual applications, creating a critical gap in design principles.

Method: Systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling, distilling six practical insights, culminating in ViT³ - a pure TTT architecture with linear complexity and parallelizable computation.

Result: ViT³ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (Mamba, linear attention variants) across image classification, generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation, narrowing gap to optimized vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The study establishes design principles for effective visual TTT and provides ViT³ as a baseline to facilitate future work on efficient visual sequence modeling with linear complexity.

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has recently emerged as a promising direction for efficient sequence modeling. TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.

Motivation: Traditional CNN methods struggle with long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships in retinal vessel segmentation, which is crucial for clinical diagnosis of ophthalmic and systemic diseases.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) with Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) featuring parallel CNN and Transformer pathways interleaved with KANConv and KAT blocks. Includes Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module, attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE), and advanced SFE-GAF module with adaptive sampling for precise vessel morphology focus.

Conclusion: DB-KAUNet effectively addresses limitations of traditional CNNs by combining CNN and Transformer strengths with novel architectural components, achieving state-of-the-art performance in retinal vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of numerous ophthalmic and systemic diseases. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleBridge-Det is a novel large detection framework for tiny objects in remote sensing imagery that achieves balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny object detection in remote sensing faces challenges with extreme scale variation and density distribution, especially when dense tiny objects coexist with large objects. Existing methods struggle with balanced performance across scales, and large foundation models haven't been effectively applied to this domain due to these scale challenges.

Method: Proposes ScaleBridge-Det with two key components: 1) Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to prevent bias toward dominant scales, and 2) Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers for efficient resource allocation across scales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD benchmarks, while demonstrating superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone dataset. The framework optimizes performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs.

Conclusion: ScaleBridge-Det successfully bridges the scale gap in remote sensing object detection by introducing adaptive routing and density-guided query allocation, enabling balanced detection performance across diverse object scales and establishing the first effective large detection framework for tiny objects in this domain.

Abstract: Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

*Felix Nützel,Mischa Dombrowski,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP uses guided residual adapters with sample-wise partitioning to address gradient conflicts in long-tail text-to-image diffusion models, improving rare class generation quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with long-tail distributions (e.g., medical imaging with rare pathologies), leading to mode collapse where tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions.

Method: GRASP (Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning) uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes, then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency.

Result: On MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels, and generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability.

Conclusion: GRASP effectively addresses gradient conflicts in long-tail diffusion models through sample partitioning and residual adapters, providing lightweight, scalable solution that integrates well with existing diffusion pipelines and improves rare class generation quality and diversity.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.

TL;DR: Proposes SCAR, a method for generating realistic hand-object interaction videos using structure and contact-aware representation without 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating hand-object interaction videos face a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations, which cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. There's a need for a representation that captures physical constraints like contact and occlusion without requiring 3D annotations.

Method: Introduces a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. Uses a joint-generation paradigm with share-and-specialization strategy to generate both interaction-oriented representations and videos.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Shows strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SCAR method successfully addresses the scalability-fidelity trade-off in hand-object interaction video generation through an interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal that learns fine-grained interaction physics without 3D annotations.

Abstract: Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.

Result: Achieves 29.2% increase in character consistency and 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, with high spatial accuracy.

Conclusion: DreamingComics effectively addresses limitations in story visualization by providing layout-aware control and improved consistency through novel positional encoding and layout generation techniques.

Abstract: Current story visualization methods tend to position subjects solely by text and face challenges in maintaining artistic consistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

*Xiuli Bi,Die Xiao,Junchao Fan,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSR method addresses CLIP-based WSSS limitations by rectifying over-activation in non-target foreground and background regions through semantic and spatial mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches suffer from over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) with two components: 1) Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) for semantic-level contrastive learning to align features across modalities and reduce inter-class overlap, and 2) Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) for spatial-level filtering using superpixel-based priors during affinity propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC (79.5% mIoU) and MS COCO (50.6% mIoU), outperforming both single-stage and more complex multi-stage approaches.

Conclusion: The SSR method effectively addresses key limitations in CLIP-based WSSS by combining semantic alignment and spatial correction, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.

TL;DR: FreqEdit is a training-free framework that addresses quality degradation in multi-turn image editing by preserving high-frequency information through reference velocity field injection, adaptive spatial modulation, and path compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models work well for single edits but suffer severe quality degradation in multi-turn editing scenarios due to progressive loss of high-frequency information.

Method: Three components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine details, (2) adaptive injection strategy for spatial modulation of injection strength, and (3) path compensation mechanism to periodically recalibrate editing trajectory.

Result: FreqEdit enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations and outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in both identity preservation and instruction following.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively addresses the multi-turn editing degradation problem by preserving high-frequency information, offering a practical solution for stable iterative image editing.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing through natural language has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive visual manipulation. While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: HiconAgent is a GUI agent with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) that efficiently uses historical context through dynamic sampling and compression techniques, achieving better performance with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents need historical context for sequential navigation, but naive use of full history causes computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information.

Method: History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) with two components: Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) for variable length history during sampling, and Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) with dual branch strategy that removes history observations while keeping actions as anchors, coupled through history-enhanced alignment loss.

Result: HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46% grounding accuracy and +11.32% step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, achieves comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x speedup and 60% FLOPs reduction.

Conclusion: HiconAgent demonstrates efficient and effective utilization of historical information for GUI navigation through adaptive context sampling and compression, achieving strong performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.

### [208] [VideoScoop: A Non-Traditional Domain-Independent Framework For Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01769)
*Hafsa Billah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general-purpose Video Situation Analysis framework using both relational and graph models to detect complex situations across domains like surveillance and assisted living.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video situation analysis is either manual (error-prone, labor-intensive) or uses custom algorithms that are domain-specific and not generalizable. There's a need for automated, general-purpose VSA that works across different domains.

Method: Extract video content using state-of-the-art IVA, represent using extended relational model (R++) and graph models. Use Continuous Query Language for relational analysis and graph algorithms for complex situation detection. Create parameterized templates for domain independence.

Result: Extensive experiments across AL, CM, and SL domains show the approach is accurate, efficient, and robust with varying video lengths.

Conclusion: Proposed framework overcomes limitations of manual analysis and domain-specific algorithms, providing general-purpose VSA that works across multiple domains with good performance.

Abstract: Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.
  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.

TL;DR: Proposes learnable edge kernels integrated with learning-based rigid/non-rigid registration for medical images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image registration faces challenges with contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality variations. Traditional methods struggle with these issues, requiring improved techniques for better multi-modal alignment in clinical applications.

Method: Integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based registration. Starts with predefined edge detection kernels perturbed with random noise, then learns optimal edge features during training. Introduces four variant models each for rigid and non-rigid registration to analyze component contributions.

Result: Method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques across three setups (rigid with/without skull removal, non-rigid) on Medical University dataset and two public datasets, demonstrating superior multi-modal alignment.

Conclusion: The adaptive edge detection approach enhances medical image registration by capturing diverse structural features, showing potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis for clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extending SAM2 for Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) using two approaches: 1) SAM2 extracts object masks with parallel segmentation network for refinement, and 2) using mask features for classification then combining results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 excels at promptable object segmentation but extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) is challenging due to needs for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and tracking multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales.

Method: Two approaches: 1) SAM2 extracts unique object masks from images with parallel segmentation network for refinement, 2) predicted masks extract feature vectors fed into simple network for classification, then combine classifications and masks for final segmentation.

Result: Experiments show leveraging SAM2 enhances overall VSS performance, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

Conclusion: SAM2 can be effectively extended for Video Semantic Segmentation, with its precise boundary prediction capabilities providing significant performance improvements despite the challenges of spatial accuracy and temporal consistency requirements.

Abstract: The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

Motivation: Addressing data transmission and storage challenges from rapidly growing satellite Earth observation data by evaluating task-specific learned compression algorithms.

Method: Compared traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus learned compression (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: fire, cloud, and building detection using both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy metrics.

Result: Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery, but traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets. Joint end-to-end optimization doesn't improve performance over standalone optimization.

Conclusion: Learned compression shows strong potential for EO data compression, particularly for large multi-channel datasets, though traditional methods remain viable for certain data types; separate optimization of compression and segmentation models is sufficient.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems poses significant challenges in data transmission and storage. We evaluate the potential of task-specific learned compression algorithms in this context to reduce data volumes while retaining crucial information. In detail, we compare traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus a learned compression approach (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: Fire, cloud, and building detection. Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Additionally, joint end-to-end optimization of compression and segmentation models does not improve performance over standalone optimization.

TL;DR: New metric for evaluating human action videos combines skeletal geometry and appearance features to measure distance from real-world action distributions, outperforming existing methods by 68% on temporal challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation metrics are appearance-biased and lack temporal understanding, struggling to assess motion dynamics and anatomical plausibility in generated human action videos.

Method: Learns latent space from real-world human actions by fusing appearance-agnostic skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features, then measures distance of generated videos from this learned distribution.

Result: Achieves 68% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on new temporal benchmark, performs competitively on external benchmarks, and shows stronger correlation with human perception.

Conclusion: Establishes new standard for video generation evaluation by addressing critical limitations in current models and providing robust assessment of human action fidelity.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.

TL;DR: MILO introduces an implicit spatial world modeling paradigm with visual feedback and relative positional encoding to improve MLLMs' spatial reasoning, trained on a new geometry-aware dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual illiteracy in spatial reasoning - they learn spatial concepts only through textual symbols without connection to visual manifestations, lacking human-like spatial imagination.

Method: MILO integrates a visual generator for geometry-aware feedback to ground symbolic reasoning in perception, plus RePE (Relative Positional Encoding) for camera-pose transformations, trained on GeoGen dataset (2,241 videos, 67,827 triplets).

Result: Experiments show significant enhancement of spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering more holistic 3D space understanding.

Conclusion: The implicit spatial world modeling paradigm with visual feedback and relative encoding effectively bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and perceptual experience in MLLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate human causal thinking in AI systems by enabling models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities, not just perceive their presence

Method: Three-component training: (1) VCG-32K dataset curation (32K+ images with entity-level causal graphs), (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought for reasoning trajectory synthesis, (3) reinforcement learning with causal reward to refine reasoning policy

Result: CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery with over threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain)

Conclusion: Successfully introduces visual causal discovery task and demonstrates CauSight's effectiveness through comprehensive dataset, novel reasoning method, and significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models

Abstract: Causal thinking enables humans to understand not just what is seen, but why it happens. To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery. It requires models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities across diverse scenarios instead of merely perceiving their presence. To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain).

*Songyan Zhang,Wenhui Huang,Zhan Chen,Chua Jiahao Collister,Qihang Huang,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenREAD is an end-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that uses Chain-of-Thought annotations and LLM-based reward modeling to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage fine-tuning approaches for autonomous driving have limitations: SFT lacks reasoning generalization, and RFT is difficult to apply to open-ended scene understanding tasks due to reward quantification challenges.

Method: Proposes OpenREAD framework with: 1) Large-scale Chain-of-Thought annotations on driving datasets, 2) Using Qwen3 LLM as critic for reward modeling of open-ended reasoning quality, 3) End-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning across reasoning to trajectory planning.

Result: Extensive experiments show joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Conclusion: OpenREAD enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning across the full spectrum of autonomous driving tasks, overcoming limitations of current two-stage approaches and demonstrating superior reasoning and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

*Zeqing Wang,Keze Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers create a Physical Implausibility Detection (PID) dataset and fine-tune VLMs to detect physically impossible content in T2V-generated videos, benchmarking current models' adherence to physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While T2V models have improved in quality and scale, their ability to generate physically plausible videos remains questionable. Current VLMs struggle to identify physically impossible content, creating a need for specialized evaluation tools.

Method: Construct a PID dataset with 500 manually annotated test videos and 2,588 paired training videos. Fine-tune VLMs to detect physical implausibility and generate explanations of violated physical principles (PhyDetEx).

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs (PhyDetEx) can effectively detect physically implausible events and explain violated principles. Benchmarking shows T2V models still struggle with physical plausibility, especially open-source models.

Conclusion: Understanding and adhering to physical laws remains challenging for T2V models. The proposed PhyDetEx provides a valuable tool for evaluating physical plausibility, with dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Driven by the growing capacity and training scale, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation models have recently achieved substantial progress in video quality, length, and instruction-following capability. However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models. Our dataset, training code, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework for sports video analysis that uses specialized agents as cognitive tools to handle temporal hierarchies from micro-actions to macro-strategies, enabling adaptive pipelines for both short-term reasoning and long-term summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end models for sports video analysis struggle with temporal hierarchy, lack generalization, have high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. There's a need for a more flexible, scalable, and interpretable system.

Method: Proposes a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System where each agent functions as a specialized "cognitive tool" for specific analysis aspects. The framework uses iterative invocation and flexible composition of agents to construct adaptive pipelines for different temporal scales and tasks.

Result: Demonstrated the framework's adaptability using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

Conclusion: This work presents a paradigm shift toward a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence, overcoming limitations of existing end-to-end models through a reconfigurable multi-agent approach.

Abstract: Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransientTrack is a deep learning framework for tracking cells in multi-channel microscopy videos with transient fluorescent signals, detecting cell division and death events to build complete cell lineages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cell tracking methods are limited to videos with constant signals and don't detect key events like cell death, creating a need for better tracking in multi-channel data with fluctuating signals like circadian rhythms.

Method: Uses Transformer Networks for cell detection embeddings, performs multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, interpolates missing tracklets with Kalman Filter, and identifies mitosis and apoptosis events.

Result: Achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracks cells while capturing division and death events, and demonstrates utility in analyzing chemotherapeutic drug efficacy at single-cell level.

Conclusion: TransientTrack advances quantitative cancer cell dynamics studies by enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms through complete cell lineage tracking.

Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

Conclusion: KM-ViPE advances practical spatial intelligence for embodied AI, making it well-suited for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications by combining real-time operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and dynamic scene robustness in a single framework.

Abstract: We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face retargeting methods trained on real-world faces fail to generalize across domains, require test-time optimizations, or need carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations.

Method: Proposes efficient data augmentation strategy with dual-encoder framework to extract domain-invariant identity cues and capture domain-specific stylistic variations, then conditions diffusion model for cross-domain retargeting.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across wide range of visual domains compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: StyleYourSmile enables effective one-shot cross-domain face retargeting without requiring curated multi-style paired data, achieving better disentanglement of identity and style attributes.

Abstract: Cross-domain face retargeting requires disentangled control over identity, expressions, and domain-specific stylistic attributes. Existing methods, typically trained on real-world faces, either fail to generalize across domains, need test-time optimizations, or require fine-tuning with carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations. In this work, we introduce \textit{StyleYourSmile}, a novel one-shot cross-domain face retargeting method that eliminates the need for curated multi-style paired data. We propose an efficient data augmentation strategy alongside a dual-encoder framework, for extracting domain-invariant identity cues and capturing domain-specific stylistic variations. Leveraging these disentangled control signals, we condition a diffusion model to retarget facial expressions across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{StyleYourSmile} achieves superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across a wide range of visual domains.

### [222] [SARL: Spatially-Aware Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Visuo-Tactile Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01908)
*Gurmeher Khurana,Lan Wei,Dandan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARL is a spatially-aware self-supervised learning framework for fused visual-tactile data that preserves spatial structure through map-level objectives, outperforming existing SSL methods on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires local geometry representations. While fused visual-tactile sensors provide aligned inputs, most SSL frameworks compress spatial structure into global vectors, misaligning with manipulation needs that require spatial awareness.

Method: Proposes SARL, augmenting BYOL architecture with three map-level objectives: Saliency Alignment (SAL) for attentional focus, Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA) for part composition, and Region Affinity Matching (RAM) for geometric relations. These losses act on intermediate feature maps to maintain spatial equivariance.

Result: SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks. On edge-pose regression, achieves 0.3955 MAE (30% improvement over next-best SSL method at 0.5682 MAE), approaching supervised upper bound performance.

Conclusion: For fused visual-tactile data, structured spatial equivariance (features varying predictably with object geometry) is the most effective signal, enabling more capable robotic perception for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires representations that encode local geometry. Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-VCD is a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that reduces hallucinations in medical LVLMs without slowing inference, improving factual accuracy by 13% and hallucination accuracy by 6% across eight medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical LVLMs are vulnerable to plausible but incorrect hallucinations, and existing decoding strategies for natural images either slow inference substantially or are domain-specific, potentially causing modality misalignment.

Method: Med-VCD uses sparse visual-contrastive decoding with a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context for efficient and reliable hallucination mitigation.

Result: Evaluations across eight medical datasets (ophthalmology, radiology, pathology) show Med-VCD improves factual accuracy by 13% and hallucination accuracy by 6% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

Conclusion: Med-VCD effectively mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without inference slowdown, balancing efficiency with reliability through its sparse visual-contrastive decoding approach.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

TL;DR: AdvTraj: First online physical ID-manipulation attack against MOT systems using adversarial trajectories to transfer attacker's ID to target objects, achieving 100% success in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MOT attacks were limited - either focused on individual trackers, required attacking object detection module, were model-specific, non-robust, and only worked offline. There's a need to explore vulnerabilities in the object association phase of MOT systems.

Method: AdvTraj uses adversarial trajectories to transfer attacker's ID to targeted objects without attacking object detection. Tested in CARLA simulator with white-box attacks against SORT, and evaluated transferability to other MOT algorithms. Also characterized trajectory patterns and proposed universal adversarial maneuvers for real-world implementation.

Result: 100% attack success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, with high transferability (up to 93% success rate) against state-of-the-art MOT algorithms. Identified universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by humans in daily scenarios.

Conclusion: Reveals previously unexplored weaknesses in object association phase of MOT systems, demonstrating that adversarial trajectories can effectively manipulate ID assignments. Provides insights for enhancing robustness of tracking systems against such attacks.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Script is a plug-and-play pruning method for MLLMs that removes redundant visual tokens without retraining, achieving up to 6.8x speedup and 10x FLOP reduction while maintaining 96.88% performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens in multimodal LLMs cause excessive memory and latency issues, especially with high-resolution images/videos. Existing pruning methods ignore query relevance or have attention mechanism limitations, reducing adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: Script uses two modules: 1) graph-structured pruning to remove visually redundant tokens, and 2) query-conditioned semantic pruning to preserve query-relevant visual information. It's plug-and-play and requires no retraining.

Result: On 14 benchmarks across image/video understanding tasks, Script consistently achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than existing methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B: up to 6.8x prefill speedup, 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% original performance.

Conclusion: Script effectively addresses MLLM efficiency issues through dual pruning modules that balance redundancy removal with query relevance preservation, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for multimodal model optimization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.

TL;DR: SpriteHand is an autoregressive video generation framework that synthesizes realistic hand-object interaction videos in real-time from static object images and hand motion streams, supporting diverse object types including non-rigid and articulated entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation-based approaches rely on rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated objects like deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or living creatures.

Method: SpriteHand uses an autoregressive video generation framework with causal inference architecture for real-time synthesis. It takes static object images and hand motion video streams as input, generates hand-object interaction effects, and employs hybrid post-training to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence.

Result: The 1.3B model achieves real-time streaming generation at ~18 FPS and 640x368 resolution with ~150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, supporting over a minute of continuous output. It demonstrates superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to generative and engine-based baselines.

Conclusion: SpriteHand presents an effective solution for synthesizing versatile hand-object interaction videos across diverse object types, overcoming limitations of conventional simulation-based approaches through its autoregressive generation framework and hybrid training approach.

Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

TL;DR: SegCaptioning task translates simple bounding box prompts into diverse (caption, mask) pairs using scene graph-guided diffusion for correlated multimodal predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional controllable image understanding tasks require expensive prompt inputs (detailed text/boxes) but output limited information. Need a method that uses minimal prompts (simple bounding boxes) to generate diverse semantic interpretations with aligned captions and masks.

Method: Propose Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model (SGDiff): 1) Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor maps user prompts to scene graphs capturing intention; 2) Diffusion process with Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer predicts correlated caption-mask pairs; 3) Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss aligns visual and textual entities via inter-modal similarity.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets show SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, producing promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

Conclusion: SegCaptioning enables flexible semantic interpretation from simple prompts, and SGDiff effectively addresses the challenge of generating diverse, well-aligned caption-mask pairs through scene graph guidance and multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

TL;DR: Artemis introduces structured proposal-based reasoning with (label, bounding-box) pairs instead of linguistic reasoning for visual perception policies, achieving strong performance on grounding/detection tasks and generalization to counting/geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL frameworks use linguistic intermediate reasoning for visual perception, but this reduces performance because visual perception requires spatial and object-centric reasoning rather than unstructured linguistic reasoning.

Method: Artemis performs structured proposal-based reasoning where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing verifiable visual states, enabling explicit state tracking and direct supervision for proposal quality.

Result: Artemis achieves strong performance on grounding and detection tasks, exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks, and shows competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning, and spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAI-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Physical AI capabilities across video generation and understanding, revealing current models struggle with physical coherence and forecasting despite good visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs and video generative models' capabilities for perceiving and predicting real-world physical dynamics are not well understood, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Introduces PAI-Bench, a unified benchmark with 2,808 real-world cases across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, using task-aligned metrics for physical plausibility and domain reasoning.

Result: Video generative models show strong visual fidelity but struggle with physically coherent dynamics; multi-modal LLMs have limited forecasting and causal interpretation abilities, indicating early-stage Physical AI capabilities.

Conclusion: PAI-Bench provides a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights critical gaps in current systems that future research must address to achieve robust physical perception and prediction.

Abstract: Physical AI aims to develop models that can perceive and predict real-world dynamics; yet, the extent to which current multi-modal large language models and video generative models support these abilities is insufficiently understood. We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions.

### [233] [Improved Mean Flows: On the Challenges of Fastforward Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02012)
*Zhengyang Geng,Yiyang Lu,Zongze Wu,Eli Shechtman,J. Zico Kolter,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improved MeanFlow (iMF) enhances one-step generative modeling with better training stability through velocity reparameterization and flexible guidance via explicit conditioning, achieving 1.72 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with single function evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow's fastforward nature creates challenges: 1) training objective depends on both ground-truth fields and the network itself, causing instability, and 2) classifier-free guidance scale is fixed during training, sacrificing test-time flexibility.

Method: 1) Reformulate training objective as loss on instantaneous velocity v, reparameterized by network predicting average velocity u for more stable regression. 2) Formulate guidance as explicit conditioning variables with in-context conditioning to maintain test-time flexibility while reducing model size.

Result: iMF achieves 1.72 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with single function evaluation (1-NFE), substantially outperforming prior one-step methods and closing the gap with multi-step methods without using distillation.

Conclusion: The improved MeanFlow (iMF) method advances fastforward generative modeling as a standalone paradigm by solving key training stability and guidance flexibility issues, enabling competitive performance with single-step inference.

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUNA is a unified multimodal model that creates a single continuous visual representation space for both understanding and generation tasks, outperforming decoupled approaches and achieving SOTA results across image/video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior unified multimodal models use decoupled representations that cause format mismatches between separate encoders for understanding and generation. The authors aim to create a truly unified representation space that avoids these issues and allows end-to-end processing for both tasks.

Method: TUNA builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This creates a single representation space that enables end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks within one framework.

Result: TUNA outperforms decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks for image/video understanding, image/video generation, and image editing. Stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently improve performance across all tasks.

Conclusion: The unified representation design is effective and scalable. Joint training on both understanding and generation data allows the tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. The representation encoder quality is crucial for performance across all multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video-to-video framework that uses 3D point tracks to jointly edit camera and object motions while preserving scene context and handling occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion editing methods lack full-scene context for consistent video editing and offer limited control over fine-grained object motion, especially under complex movements.

Method: Track-conditioned V2V framework that conditions video generation on source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source/target motions, using 3D tracks for depth cues and occlusion handling.

Result: Enables diverse motion edits including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation while preserving spatiotemporal coherence.

Conclusion: The 3D track-based approach provides precise motion editing with explicit depth cues, resolving depth order and occlusions, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

Abstract: Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

*Varun Varma Thozhiyoor,Shivam Tripathi,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Anand Bhattad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generators fail to accurately represent gravity, showing objects falling at slower acceleration than real-world physics, but targeted fine-tuning with minimal data can partially correct this physical gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether video generators can serve as world models by testing their representation of fundamental physical laws like gravity, and to determine if observed physical errors are artifacts of ambiguous metric scale or genuine failures in physical understanding.

Method: Introduced a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests timing ratio t₁²/t₂² = h₁/h₂, independent of gravity constant, focal length, and scale. Used lightweight low-rank adaptors fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips to correct physical inaccuracies.

Result: Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at effectively slower acceleration (g_eff = 1.81 m/s²). Fine-tuning raised g_eff to 6.43 m/s² (65% of terrestrial gravity). The specialist adaptor generalized zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes.

Conclusion: Video generators currently violate Galileo's equivalence principle and fail to accurately represent gravity, but specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal targeted data, suggesting potential for improving physical understanding in generative models.

Abstract: Video generators are increasingly evaluated as potential world models, which requires them to encode and understand physical laws. We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated theorem proving for Euclidean geometry at IMO level remains challenging; existing approaches often rely on neural networks, but there's need for efficient CPU-based methods that can match human gold-medal performance.

Method: HAGeo uses heuristic-based method for adding auxiliary constructions in geometric deduction, building on initial findings that simple random auxiliary point strategies can achieve silver-medal performance.

Result: Solves 28 of 30 problems on IMO-30 benchmark (gold-medal level), surpassing AlphaGeometry; introduces HAGeo-409 benchmark with 409 problems and human-assessed difficulty levels for more comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: HAGeo demonstrates that heuristic-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art geometry theorem proving without neural networks, and the new benchmark sets higher standards for future research in this field.

Abstract: Automated theorem proving in Euclidean geometry, particularly for International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems, remains a major challenge and an important research focus in Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method for geometry theorem proving that runs entirely on CPUs without relying on neural network-based inference. Our initial study shows that a simple random strategy for adding auxiliary points can achieve silver-medal level human performance on IMO. Building on this, we propose HAGeo, a Heuristic-based method for adding Auxiliary constructions in Geometric deduction that solves 28 of 30 problems on the IMO-30 benchmark, achieving gold-medal level performance and surpassing AlphaGeometry, a competitive neural network-based approach, by a notable margin. To evaluate our method and existing approaches more comprehensively, we further construct HAGeo-409, a benchmark consisting of 409 geometry problems with human-assessed difficulty levels. Compared with the widely used IMO-30, our benchmark poses greater challenges and provides a more precise evaluation, setting a higher bar for geometry theorem proving.

TL;DR: A statistical framework that stitches benchmarks together to create a unified scale for comparing AI capabilities across time and benchmarks, enabling long-term trend analysis without assumptions about capability evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI benchmarks saturate quickly (within years or months), making it difficult to study long-run trends in AI capabilities. There's a need for a method to compare models across different benchmarks and time periods.

Method: Developed a statistical framework that stitches benchmarks together, placing model capabilities and benchmark difficulties on a single numerical scale. This creates a "Rosetta Stone" for cross-benchmark comparison without assuming how capabilities evolve over time or with training compute.

Result: The framework enables three key applications: 1) Measuring the speed of AI progress over time and forecasting future capabilities, 2) Estimating algorithmic efficiency improvements (finding higher but broadly consistent estimates with prior work), and 3) Detecting rapid accelerations in AI progress.

Conclusion: The statistical framework successfully addresses the benchmark saturation problem by enabling long-term comparison of AI capabilities across different benchmarks and time periods, providing valuable tools for measuring progress, forecasting capabilities, and detecting accelerations in AI development.

Abstract: Most AI benchmarks saturate within years or even months after they are introduced, making it hard to study long-run trends in AI capabilities. To address this challenge, we build a statistical framework that stitches benchmarks together, putting model capabilities and benchmark difficulties on a single numerical scale. This acts as a "Rosetta Stone", allowing us to compare models across a wide range of abilities and time, even if they are not evaluated on the same benchmarks. Moreover, this works without assuming how capabilities evolve across time or with training compute. We demonstrate three applications of this framework. First, we use it to measure the speed of AI progress over time, and to forecast future AI capabilities. Second, we estimate the rate of improvements in algorithmic efficiency, finding estimates that are higher, but broadly consistent with prior work. Finally, we find that our approach can be used to detect rapid accelerations in AI progress.

*Matt MacDermott,Qiyao Wei,Rada Djoneva,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training incentives affect how faithfully chain-of-thought reasoning reflects underlying thought processes, impacting safety monitoring effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems that output reasoning in natural language offer safety opportunities through monitoring, but training incentives may affect how faithfully chain-of-thought reflects actual reasoning processes.

Method: Introduce novel methodology measuring monitorability by whether a monitor can predict key latent variables using model's reasoning. Test effects of different training incentives (length penalties, KL regularization, adversarial optimization, direct monitorability optimization) while controlling for accuracy.

Result: No consistent effects from common incentives (length penalties, KL regularization). Adversarial optimization degrades monitor performance, while direct optimization for monitorability doesn't reliably improve it.

Conclusion: Training incentives can impact monitorability of AI reasoning, with adversarial optimization harming monitoring effectiveness, highlighting need for careful consideration of training approaches for safety-critical systems.

Abstract: AI systems that output their reasoning in natural language offer an opportunity for safety -- we can \emph{monitor} their chain of thought (CoT) for undesirable reasoning, such as the pursuit of harmful objectives. However, the extent to which CoT faithfully reflects the underlying reasoning process, and hence the extent to which it can be usefully monitored, may be influenced by certain aspects of training. We investigate how different \emph{training incentives}, applied to a reasoning model, affect its monitorability. We introduce a novel methodology for measuring monitorability according to whether a monitor can predict a key latent variable using the model's reasoning. When controlling for accuracy, we do not find evidence for consistent effects from commonly used incentives (length penalties and KL regularisation), but we find that adversarial optimisation (penalising monitor accuracy) degrades monitor performance, while direct optimisation for monitorability does not reliably lead to improvements.

TL;DR: Trification: A novel automated fact-checking framework that decomposes claims into verification actions structured as a dependency graph, enabling complete coverage and logical reasoning for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid spread of false information online necessitates automated fact-checking systems. Previous methods fail to verify every claim component and lack structured frameworks to logically connect sub-task results.

Method: Proposes Trification framework that: 1) generates comprehensive verification actions for complete claim coverage, 2) structures actions into a dependency graph modeling logical interactions, and 3) allows dynamic graph modification for adaptive verification strategies.

Result: Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate significant enhancement in fact-checking accuracy, advancing state-of-the-art in automated fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: Trification effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by ensuring complete claim verification through structured dependency graphs, providing a robust framework for automated fact-checking that adapts to verification needs.

Abstract: Technological advancement allows information to be shared in just a single click, which has enabled the rapid spread of false information. This makes automated fact-checking system necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our online media ecosystem. Previous methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of decomposing the claim into simpler sub-tasks and utilizing LLM-based multi agent system to execute them. However, those models faces two limitations: they often fail to verify every component in the claim and lack of structured framework to logically connect the results of sub-tasks for a final prediction. In this work, we propose a novel automated fact-checking framework called Trification. Our framework begins by generating a comprehensive set of verification actions to ensure complete coverage of the claim. It then structured these actions into a dependency graph to model the logical interaction between actions. Furthermore, the graph can be dynamically modified, allowing the system to adapt its verification strategy. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances fact-checking accuracy, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact-checking system.

TL;DR: PointCoT enhances MLLM chart comprehension by integrating visual grounding with chain-of-thought reasoning, using bounding boxes and chart re-rendering to connect textual reasoning with visual elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for chart comprehension rely too heavily on OCR-extracted content and suffer from numerical hallucinations when chart annotations are sparse. They lack proper visual grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, failing to localize key positions to match their reasoning.

Method: Propose PointCoT that integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning by prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations. Also introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k dataset with 19.2K chart samples featuring step-by-step CoT, bounding boxes, and re-rendered visualizations.

Result: Developed two instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, achieving +5.04% improvement on ChartBench.

Conclusion: PointCoT successfully bridges the gap between textual reasoning and visual grounding in chart comprehension, addressing fundamental limitations of current MLLMs by establishing connections between reasoning steps and visual regions through bounding boxes and chart re-rendering.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for chart comprehension. However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse. While existing methods focus on scaling instructions, they fail to address the fundamental challenge, i.e., reasoning with visual perception. In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations. Leveraging this data, we develop two instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, e.g., +5.04\% on ChartBench.

*Ruike Hu,Shulei Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lightweight RL framework bridges LLM's probabilistic generation with deterministic structured data requirements using multi-dimensional rewards and gradient-regularized optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with structured data formats due to "Structure Gap" - tension between probabilistic token generation and deterministic format requirements, causing hallucinations and malformed outputs.

Method: Proposes lightweight RL framework with multi-dimensional reward function (structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, validity) using Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) without separate critic network.

Result: Achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, outperforming zero-shot baselines (GPT-3.5) and SFT on LLaMA-3-8B, with 40% VRAM reduction vs PPO.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges structure gap, enabling LLMs to internalize constraints while maintaining efficiency, with training showing self-paced curriculum from syntactic to semantic proficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning. However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the "Structure Gap" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to "hallucinated" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of training dynamics, revealing a distinct self-paced curriculum where the model sequentially acquires syntactic proficiency before semantic accuracy. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Freakz3z/Qwen-JSON.

TL;DR: CogEvo-Edu: A hierarchical multi-agent system that treats retrieval, memory, and control as coupled cognitive evolution for adaptive STEM tutoring, outperforming static RAG approaches in DSP education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based STEM tutors rely on single models with static RAG pipelines, which struggle with complex domains like digital signal processing that require coherent long-term student modeling, heterogeneous knowledge management, and adaptive teaching strategies over extended interactions.

Method: CogEvo-Edu uses a hierarchical multi-agent system with three layers: Cognitive Perception Layer (dual memories with confidence-weighted consolidation), Knowledge Evolution Layer (spatiotemporal value-driven knowledge management), and Meta-Control Layer (hierarchical sequential decision making with dual inner-outer loop adaptation).

Result: On DSP-EduBench, CogEvo-Edu raised overall scores from 5.32 to 9.23 and improved all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and single-agent variants, using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble for evaluation.

Conclusion: Jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies through a coupled cognitive evolution approach significantly improves adaptive tutoring performance in complex STEM domains like digital signal processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational tutors in STEM education, yet most systems still rely on a single LLM with a static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline over course materials. This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies.

TL;DR: First RL framework for optimizing LLMs on subjective, personality-sensitive conversation by inferring user personality on-the-fly, outperforming proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL research focuses on objective tasks (math, code) while ignoring subjective conversation that defines human intelligence, leaving personality-sensitive dialogue as an unsolved RL problem.

Method: Proposes framework that infers user personality dynamically and optimizes model behavior toward personalized conversational preferences, with dynamic emotional intelligence evaluation suite.

Result: Echo-N1 model shows dramatic improvements in humanlike interaction quality, outperforming base version and proprietary Doubao 1.5 Character, demonstrating RL works in subjective settings.

Conclusion: Establishes new RL frontier for optimizing models on subjective, human dimensions of conversation, challenging belief that RL collapses in non-verifiable settings.

Abstract: The LLM field has spent a year perfecting RL for tasks machines already excel at, math, code, and deterministic reasoning, while completely sidestepping the domain that actually defines human intelligence: subjective, emotionally grounded, personality sensitive conversation. This space has often been regarded as inherently subjective and challenging to formalize, making it appear unsuitable for conventional RL pipelines. We show that it is not only possible and it is a solvable and transformative RL problem. We propose the first framework that infers user personality on the fly and optimizes model behavior toward personalized conversational preferences. Contrary to the widespread belief that RL collapses in non-verifiable settings, our method produces consistent, robust, and dramatic improvements in humanlike interaction quality. We also introduce the first dynamic emotional intelligence evaluation suite to quantify these gains. Our model, which is introduced as Echo-N1, behaves far above its base version and outperforming the proprietary Doubao 1.5 Character. This work establishes a new frontier for RL: optimizing models for the deeply subjective, deeply human dimensions of conversation.

*Sitong Fang,Shiyi Hou,Kaile Wang,Boyuan Chen,Donghai Hong,Jiayi Zhou,Josef Dai,Yaodong Yang,Jiaming Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper introduces MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal deception in AI systems, and proposes a debate-with-images framework to detect deceptive behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities advance, deceptive behaviors have spread from text to multimodal settings, posing serious safety risks. Current research focuses only on textual deception, leaving multimodal deception unexplored and difficult to detect due to visual-semantic ambiguity and cross-modal reasoning complexity.

Method: 1) Created MM-DeceptionBench benchmark covering six categories of deception to systematically evaluate multimodal deception. 2) Proposed "debate with images" - a multi-agent debate monitor framework that forces models to ground claims in visual evidence to improve deception detection.

Result: The debate-with-images method significantly improves deception detection, increasing agreement with human judgments across all tested models. It boosts Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o compared to existing monitoring approaches.

Conclusion: Multimodal deception represents a serious safety risk that requires specialized evaluation tools. The proposed MM-DeceptionBench benchmark and debate-with-images framework provide effective methods for monitoring and detecting deceptive behaviors in multimodal AI systems, addressing a critical gap in current AI safety research.

Abstract: Are frontier AI systems becoming more capable? Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GreenPlanner is an AI framework that automatically generates energy-efficient, regulation-compliant building floorplans while ensuring spatial-functional validity, dramatically accelerating design evaluation and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building design impacts both human well-being and carbon emissions, but current floorplan generation is manual, costly, and non-scalable. Existing automated methods often produce visually plausible but invalid layouts that violate key constraints due to lack of automated evaluation.

Method: GreenPlanner unifies design evaluation and generation through: 1) Design Feasibility Dataset for learning constraint priors, 2) Practical Design Evaluator (PDE) for predicting energy performance and spatial-functional validity, 3) Green Plan Dataset (GreenPD) created via PDE-guided filtering, and 4) GreenFlow generator trained on GreenPD with PDE feedback for controllable, regulation-aware generation.

Result: GreenPlanner accelerates evaluation by over 100,000× with >99% accuracy, completely eliminates invalid samples, and boosts design efficiency by 87% compared to professional architects.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the scalability and validity challenges in automated building design by integrating constraint-aware evaluation with generative AI, enabling efficient production of energy-compliant, functional floorplans.

Abstract: Building design directly affects human well-being and carbon emissions, yet generating spatial-functional and energy-compliant floorplans remains manual, costly, and non-scalable. Existing methods produce visually plausible layouts but frequently violate key constraints, yielding invalid results due to the absence of automated evaluation. We present GreenPlanner, an energy- and functionality-aware generative framework that unifies design evaluation and generation. It consists of a labeled Design Feasibility Dataset for learning constraint priors; a fast Practical Design Evaluator (PDE) for predicting energy performance and spatial-functional validity; a Green Plan Dataset (GreenPD) derived from PDE-guided filtering to pair user requirements with regulation-compliant layouts; and a GreenFlow generator trained on GreenPD with PDE feedback for controllable, regulation-aware generation. Experiments show that GreenPlanner accelerates evaluation by over $10^{5}\times$ with $>$99% accuracy, eliminates invalid samples, and boosts design efficiency by 87% over professional architects.

*Yuta Kobayashi,Vincent Jeanselme,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Missing data patterns significantly affect LLM performance in healthcare prediction tasks, with missingness indicators helping larger models but hurting smaller ones, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation of informative missingness in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive literature on informative missingness in data collection (especially in healthcare where decisions like diagnostic referrals create systematic missing patterns), the impact of missingness on Large Language Model performance remains unstudied, creating a gap in understanding how LLMs handle real-world incomplete data.

Method: Conducted experiments using data from Columbia University Medical Center and MIMIC-IV database to evaluate zero-shot predictive performance of LLMs. Tested explicit inclusion of missingness indicators during prompting and analyzed how different model sizes respond to these interventions.

Result: Missingness patterns significantly impact LLM zero-shot performance. Missingness indicators benefit some LLMs while hurting others, with inconsistent effects on predictive performance and calibration. Larger models tend to benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted.

Conclusion: The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of informative missingness, which is already often neglected in conventional machine learning. There is an urgent need for more transparent accounting and systematic evaluation of how representing missingness affects downstream performance in LLM applications.

Abstract: Data collection often reflects human decisions. In healthcare, for instance, a referral for a diagnostic test is influenced by the patient's health, their preferences, available resources, and the practitioner's recommendations. Despite the extensive literature on the informativeness of missingness, its implications on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been studied. Through a series of experiments on data from Columbia University Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center, and MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that patterns of missingness significantly impact zero-shot predictive performance. Notably, the explicit inclusion of missingness indicators at prompting benefits some while hurting other LLMs' zero-shot predictive performance and calibration, suggesting an inconsistent impact. The proposed aggregated analysis and theoretical insights suggest that larger models benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted. The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of missingness, often neglected even in conventional ML, even further. We conclude that there is a need for more transparent accounting and systematic evaluation of the impact of representing (informative) missingness on downstream performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training methods like GRPO only reward correctness, which doesn't align with multi-dimensional clinical needs requiring faithful and comprehensive reasoning in high-stakes medical fields.

Method: Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO) integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals to jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without human annotation, applied to train Clinical-R1-3B (3B parameters).

Result: CRPO substantially improves reasoning truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining accuracy enhancements across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRPO provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives for safer healthcare AI, highlighting potential of multi-objective verifiable RL methods for medical LLM post-training.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining and post-training reinforcement learning, demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains.

### [250] [EDIT: Early Diffusion Inference Termination for dLLMs Based on Dynamics of Training Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00670)
*He-Yen Hsieh,Hong Wang,H. T. Kung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination) is a method that adaptively stops diffusion-based LLM inference when reasoning stabilizes, using training gradient dynamics to reduce steps by 11.8-68.3% with minimal storage overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs often stabilize answers before completing all denoising steps, wasting computation. Training optimization dynamics contain valuable metadata about reasoning pathways that is typically discarded, but could be used to detect when inference can safely stop.

Method: EDIT monitors alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during SFT. It converts alignment scores to token distributions, detects convergence when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below threshold on visible tokens, and adaptively terminates inference.

Result: Reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% across reasoning benchmarks while preserving or improving accuracy in most settings, with only ~0.02% storage overhead (1.5-2 MB for all QKV modules across 32 blocks in an 8 GB model).

Conclusion: By leveraging training-gradient dynamics typically discarded, EDIT enables efficient early termination of dLLM inference, opening a new research direction for reducing inference time and cost while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) refine token generations through iterative denoising, but answers often stabilize before all steps complete. We propose EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination), an inference-time criterion that adaptively stops denoising once sufficient reasoning stability relative to training-time reasoning is detected. EDIT monitors the alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). During training, optimization dynamics generate rich metadata about parameter importance that in prior methods is typically discarded upon model release. We preserve this information as a compact representation of learned reasoning pathways. During inference, alignment scores are converted to a distribution over the tokens already unmasked at the current denoising step, and convergence is detected when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below a threshold on the matched unmasked (visible) tokens. Across reasoning benchmarks, EDIT reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% while preserving or improving accuracy in most settings, with approximately 0.02% storage overhead (about 1.5-2 MB for all QKV modules across 32 blocks in an 8 GB model). By utilizing training-gradient dynamics, our work opens a new research direction for reducing dLLM inference time and cost.

*Yifan Xu,Xichen Ye,Yifan Chen,Qiaosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FA-DPO is a robust alignment algorithm that addresses preference flipping in human feedback data by modeling instance-dependent flipping probabilities and uncertainty in judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference flipping in human feedback data corrupts annotations and necessitates more robust alignment algorithms for LLMs that can handle noisy preference pairs.

Method: Proposes Flipping-Aware DPO that models human intention and external flipping factors separately, uses instance-dependent flipping probabilities based on Bradley-Terry model, captures uncertainty via annotation features, and implements iterative optimization compatible with RLHF/DPO.

Result: The method is evaluated under multiple preference flipping scenarios and shows improved robustness compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FA-DPO provides an effective solution for handling preference flipping in human feedback data, enhancing the robustness of LLM alignment algorithms against noisy annotations.

Abstract: Quality of datasets plays an important role in large language model (LLM) alignment. In collecting human feedback, however, preference flipping is ubiquitous and causes corruption in data annotation; the issue necessitates the alignment algorithms with improved robustness against potential flipped pairs. To this end, this paper introduces a Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) algorithm tailored to preference flipping from a reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) perspective. We dissect the inherent human intention model and the preference flipping mechanism introduced by external factors as two distinct stages; in the latter, we introduce an instance-dependent flipping probability on the basis of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model. Further, by leveraging features relevant to preference annotation, we capture uncertainty in judgments and model preference flipping patterns. In practice, we design a simple yet efficient iterative optimization algorithm compatible with the original RLHF and DPO algorithms. In our experiments, we investigate the instance-dependent preference flipping model under multiple circumstances for evaluation of our proposed method, as well as other baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies that retrieval algorithms aim to align with LLMs, similar to knowledge distillation objectives. This insight leads to using distilled language models as retrieval algorithms for efficient long-context reasoning.

Method: Three-level co-design: (1) Algorithm: lightweight retrieval head based on DLM attention weights with >90% parameter reduction via pruning; (2) System: asynchronous prefetch dataflow with elastic loading to overlap KV cache retrieval with LLM computation; (3) Compilation: theoretical memory model with adaptive memory management to maximize GPU utilization.

Result: Achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge compared to Huggingface framework, with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.

Conclusion: SpeContext demonstrates that using distilled language models as retrieval algorithms enables efficient long-context reasoning through holistic algorithm-system-compilation co-design, significantly improving performance in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we point out that the objective of the retrieval algorithms is to align with the LLM, which is similar to the objective of knowledge distillation in LLMs. We analyze the similarity in information focus between the distilled language model(DLM) and the original LLM from the perspective of information theory, and thus propose a novel paradigm that leverages a DLM as the retrieval algorithm. Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the "psyche" of large reasoning models by characterizing their atomic reasoning steps through an interdisciplinary taxonomy grounded in human mental processes, enabling systematic analysis of their cognitive behaviors.

Method: Developed a comprehensive taxonomy with 5 groups and 17 categories based on human mental processes, applied it to create a labeled dataset of 277,534 reasoning steps, and proposed CAPO - an automatic annotation framework using LLMs for scalable taxonomy-based analysis.

Result: CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts than baselines; analysis reveals current post-answer "double-checks" are largely superficial and rarely lead to substantive revisions, suggesting multi-step reflection is more effective than simple self-monitoring.

Conclusion: The taxonomy, CAPO framework, and derived insights provide a principled, scalable approach to understanding and advancing LRM reasoning, with practical takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models through comprehensive multi-step reflection.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their exceptional capability in addressing complex tasks. Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.

Result: LVLMs show significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages vs English. GUI-XLI method improves GUI agents' multilingual P&R capability by 6.5% on average.

Conclusion: The work addresses multilingual GUI evaluation gaps and proposes effective intervention method to improve cross-lingual GUI perception and reasoning capabilities for broader global applications.

Abstract: With the advancement of computational resources, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive Perception and Reasoning (P&R) performance on Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks. However, although they demonstrate strong P&R capabilities in English GUI scenarios, their performance in multilingual settings has received little attention, which limits their global applications. Moreover, existing studies on GUI tasks lack fine-grained analyses, including widget functions and elements' spatial relationships, which are fundamental for more targeted improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose MPR-GUI-Bench, a Multilingual fine-grained Perception and Reasoning GUI Benchmark to evaluate GUI agents' P&R capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate that LVLMs exhibit significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages than in English. To address these gaps, we propose GUI-XLI, a GUI Cross-Lingual Intervention method that applies interventions to the hidden states at P&R capability-related layers to mitigate the gaps between English and other languages, building on previous research showing that the hidden states of different language inputs exhibit significant differences in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that our method improves GUI agents' multilingual P&R capability by 6.5% on average.

### [256] [BioPro: On Difference-Aware Gender Fairness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00807)
*Yujie Lin,Jiayao Ma,Qingguo Hu,Derek F. Wong,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioPro is a training-free framework that uses bias orthogonal projection to selectively reduce gender bias in VLMs while preserving legitimate gender distinctions, extending difference-aware fairness to multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness interventions in VLMs enforce uniform treatment across groups, failing to distinguish between contexts requiring neutrality and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and should be preserved.

Method: BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information, entirely training-free.

Result: BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit contexts, and generalizes to continuous bias variables like scene brightness.

Conclusion: BioPro provides a promising direction for achieving selective fairness in VLMs, extending difference-aware fairness to multimodal domains and offering broader applicability beyond gender bias.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherit significant social biases from their training data, notably in gender representation. Current fairness interventions often adopt a difference-unaware perspective that enforces uniform treatment across demographic groups. These approaches, however, fail to distinguish between contexts where neutrality is required and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and must be preserved. Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Med-CMR is a fine-grained medical multimodal reasoning benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs' visual understanding and multi-step reasoning capabilities across 20K+ clinical VQA pairs, revealing GPT-5 as top performer but highlighting persistent challenges in long-tail generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are entering clinical workflows but their complex medical reasoning capabilities remain unclear. Existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning needed for clinical decision-making.

Method: Created Med-CMR benchmark with: 1) Systematic capability decomposition into visual understanding (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and multi-step reasoning (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 2) 20,653 VQA pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities; 3) Two-stage human expert + model-assisted validation for clinical authenticity.

Result: Evaluated 18 SOTA MLLMs: GPT-5 performed best (57.81% MCQ accuracy, 48.70 open-ended score), outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87%, 45.98) and Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34%, 42.62). Specialized medical MLLMs didn't reliably outperform general models, and long-tail generalization was the dominant failure mode.

Conclusion: Med-CMR provides a rigorous stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, serving as a critical benchmark for future clinical AI systems despite current models' limitations in handling complex medical reasoning.

Abstract: MLLMs MLLMs are beginning to appear in clinical workflows, but their ability to perform complex medical reasoning remains unclear. We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.

TL;DR: Semantic communication + Agentic AI framework for V2X trajectory prediction, achieving 47.5% accuracy improvement in low SNR conditions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional V2X communication has high overhead/latency, and existing trajectory prediction lacks environmental perception and logical inference capabilities

Method: Integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI: V2I uses RSU agents for feature extraction and semantic analysis; V2V uses local agents with neighbor predictions; transmits compact semantic representations instead of raw data

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines across diverse communication conditions, achieving up to 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low SNR

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient information exchange and reliable contextual reasoning for V2X networks by combining semantic communication with Agentic AI

Abstract: Efficient information exchange and reliable contextual reasoning are essential for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

*Emily Howerton,Justin Lessler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Methods for estimating counterfactual error in scenario modeling to separate scenario deviation from model miscalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scenario projections are widely used for planning but rarely evaluated retrospectively. When projections differ from observations, it's hard to tell if the difference comes from scenario deviation (wrong assumptions about the world) or model miscalibration (wrong model). Model error assessment is crucial for decision-making but requires estimating error in counterfactual worlds.

Method: The paper presents and contrasts three approaches for estimating counterfactual error in scenario modeling. These methods are demonstrated and evaluated through a simulation experiment that tests their benefits and limitations.

Result: The simulation experiment reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for estimating counterfactual error. The analysis provides empirical evidence about which methods work best under different conditions.

Conclusion: The paper provides specific recommendations for estimating counterfactual error and discusses the necessary components of scenario design that make scenario projections evaluable, improving the reliability of future planning exercises.

Abstract: Counterfactual scenario modeling exercises that ask "what would happen if?" are one of the most common ways we plan for the future. Despite their ubiquity in planning and decision making, scenario projections are rarely evaluated retrospectively. Differences between projections and observations come from two sources: scenario deviation and model miscalibration. We argue the latter is most important for assessing the value of models in decision making, but requires estimating model error in counterfactual worlds. Here we present and contrast three approaches for estimating this error, and demonstrate the benefits and limitations of each in a simulation experiment. We provide recommendations for the estimation of counterfactual error and discuss the components of scenario design that are required to make scenario projections evaluable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding spaces are fundamental but opaque, with existing approaches sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or having high computational overhead for interpretability.

Method: Introduces SFS (Semantic Field Subspace) for local semantic neighborhoods, and SAFARI algorithm using Semantic Shift metric to quantify semantic evolution. Develops efficient approximation replacing costly SVD computations.

Result: Achieves 15-30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Outperforms standard classifiers in classification and nuanced tasks like political bias detection across six text/image datasets. Reveals interpretable semantic hierarchies.

Conclusion: Presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces with geometry-preserving, context-aware representations.

Abstract: Embedding spaces are fundamental to modern AI, translating raw data into high-dimensional vectors that encode rich semantic relationships. Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces.

TL;DR: MMQAKE is the first benchmark for multimodal multihop QA with knowledge editing, evaluating reasoning chains and robustness to visual rephrasing. Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework using dynamic multimodal knowledge graphs, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Knowledge Editing (MKE) benchmarks only assess final answer correctness, ignoring intermediate reasoning quality and robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions.

Method: Proposed Hybrid-DMKG: a hybrid reasoning framework using dynamic multimodal knowledge graphs (DMKG). It decomposes questions with LLMs, retrieves updated facts via multimodal encoding, and uses parallel reasoning paths (relation linking + RAG with VLMs) aggregated by a decision module.

Result: Current MKE methods struggle with consistent updates and reasoning over multimodal chains. Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing approaches on MMQAKE, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.

Conclusion: MMQAKE addresses limitations in MKE evaluation, and Hybrid-DMKG demonstrates superior performance for multimodal multihop reasoning with knowledge editing through its hybrid reasoning approach over dynamic multimodal knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Editing (MKE) extends traditional knowledge editing to settings involving both textual and visual modalities. However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.

*Cen Lu,Yung-Chen Tang,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LVLMs have critical structural vulnerabilities - removing just 4 neurons can cause catastrophic collapse, with language model components being most vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Vision-Language Models show impressive multimodal understanding, their robustness is poorly understood. The paper investigates structural vulnerabilities to identify critical neurons whose removal triggers catastrophic collapse.

Method: Proposed CAN method to detect Consistently Activated Neurons and locate critical neurons through progressive masking. Experiments conducted on LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b models.

Result: Masking only a tiny portion of language model's feed-forward networks (as few as 4 neurons) triggers catastrophic collapse. Critical neurons are predominantly in language model rather than vision components, with down-projection layer being particularly vulnerable. A consistent two-stage collapse pattern observed: initial expressive degradation followed by sudden complete collapse.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant structural vulnerabilities in LVLMs and provide important insights for safety research, highlighting the need for robustness improvements in these models.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet their robustness is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the structural vulnerabilities of LVLMs to identify any critical neurons whose removal triggers catastrophic collapse. In this context, we propose CAN, a method to detect Consistently Activated Neurons and to locate critical neurons by progressive masking. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b reveal that masking only a tiny portion of the language model's feed-forward networks (just as few as four neurons in extreme cases) suffices to trigger catastrophic collapse. Notably, critical neurons are predominantly localized in the language model rather than in the vision components, and the down-projection layer is a particularly vulnerable structure. We also observe a consistent two-stage collapse pattern: initial expressive degradation followed by sudden, complete collapse. Our findings provide important insights for safety research in LVLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes causal machine learning model for prescriptive maintenance that moves beyond prediction to identify root causes and recommend optimal interventions by simulating "what-if" scenarios using causal foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current predictive maintenance models rely on spurious correlations rather than true causal drivers, leading to misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. While failures can be predicted, there's no systematic method to understand why they occur or identify the most effective fixes.

Method: Uses a pre-trained causal foundation model as a "what-if" model to estimate effects of potential fixes. Measures causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs (like OEE) to provide data-driven ranking of actions. Evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data compared to baseline ML model.

Result: The model identifies root causes and quantifies their operational impact, providing a systematic approach to recommend optimal maintenance actions. Sets technical basis for robust prescriptive maintenance framework.

Conclusion: Enables engineers to test potential solutions in causal environment for more effective operational decisions, reducing costly downtimes by moving beyond diagnosis to active prescription of maintenance interventions.

Abstract: The transition to prescriptive maintenance in manufacturing is critically constrained by a dependence on predictive models. These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a "what-if" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to holistically assess chart grounding due to narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks.

Method: Proposes ChartAnchor benchmark with 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types from diverse real-world and augmented sources. Introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers). Uses multi-level evaluation framework integrating semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception.

Conclusion: ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding by unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlight the need for benchmarks that rigorously evaluate structured chart comprehension.Chart grounding refers to the bidirectional alignment between a chart's visual appearance and the structured semantics. This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world scenarios.Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM-generated reasoning traces in expert domains like law is challenging but essential for credibility and explainability, yet current methods lack proper evaluation frameworks for complex legal reasoning.

Method: Created LEGIT dataset (24K instances) by converting court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing arguments and court conclusions, using these as rubrics to evaluate reasoning trace coverage and correctness, validated via human expert annotations.

Result: LLMs' legal reasoning is seriously affected by both issue coverage and correctness; RAG improves overall reasoning capability while RL improves correctness but reduces coverage, showing complementary benefits.

Conclusion: LEGIT provides a reliable framework for evaluating legal reasoning traces, revealing critical limitations in LLM legal reasoning and demonstrating how different techniques (RAG vs RL) address different aspects of reasoning quality.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated reasoning traces in expert domains (e.g., law) is essential for ensuring credibility and explainability, yet remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of such reasoning tasks. We introduce LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees), a novel large-scale (24K instances) expert-level legal reasoning dataset with an emphasis on reasoning trace evaluation. We convert court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing parties' arguments and the court's conclusions, which serve as rubrics for evaluating the issue coverage and correctness of the reasoning traces. We verify the reliability of these rubrics via human expert annotations and comparison with coarse, less informative rubrics. Using the LEGIT dataset, we show that (1) LLMs' legal reasoning ability is seriously affected by both legal issue coverage and correctness, and that (2) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL with rubrics bring complementary benefits for legal reasoning abilities, where RAG improves overall reasoning capability, whereas RL improves correctness albeit with reduced coverage.

TL;DR: Med-CRAFT is a neuro-symbolic framework that automatically generates high-quality medical video reasoning benchmarks using deterministic graph traversal instead of traditional annotation or stochastic generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, logically annotated medical video datasets is a major bottleneck for MLLMs. Manual annotation is expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods suffer from hallucinations and lack logical interpretability.

Method: Med-CRAFT formalizes benchmark synthesis as deterministic graph traversal. It extracts visual primitives from raw videos, builds a Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph, and anchors query generation to valid paths within this graph, enforcing Chain-of-Thought provenance for every synthesized item.

Result: The pipeline produced M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark with fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Generated queries have complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets, and logic alignment analysis shows high correlation between graph topology and MLLM reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Med-CRAFT enables scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols for critical domains by encoding verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks through neuro-symbolic data engineering.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically annotated video datasets remains a primary bottleneck in advancing Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for the medical domain. Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.

Motivation: Real-world energy systems like remote microgrids require coordinated control under uncertainty while respecting strict operational constraints and regulations. RL needs interpretable safety guarantees to be safely deployed in critical energy transition applications.

Method: Shielded Controller Units (SCUs) - a systematic approach that decomposes the environment into hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints using prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction.

Result: RL agent equipped with SCUs achieved 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation in remote microgrid optimization, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all operational constraints.

Conclusion: SCUs provide a practical, interpretable approach for safe RL deployment in energy transition applications, enabling constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance in complex real-world systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimizing decision-making in complex systems under uncertainty, an essential challenge in real-world settings, particularly in the context of the energy transition. A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition.

### [270] [Automating the Refinement of Reinforcement Learning Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01047)
*Tanmay Ambadkar,Đorđe Žikelić,Abhinav Verma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoSpec framework automatically refines coarse logical specifications to provide better guidance for reinforcement learning, improving task solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse-grained logical specifications can fail to provide sufficient guidance for RL agents, especially when tasks are under-specified, leading to poor policy learning.

Method: AutoSpec searches for specification refinements using four procedures that modify the abstract graph of SpectRL specifications by refining existing edges or introducing new ones, maintaining soundness.

Result: AutoSpec enables solving more complex control tasks when integrated with existing RL algorithms, with experiments showing promising improvements in task solvability.

Conclusion: Automatic specification refinement via AutoSpec enhances RL performance by providing better guidance from logical specifications, making complex tasks more learnable.

Abstract: Logical specifications have been shown to help reinforcement learning algorithms in achieving complex tasks. However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.

TL;DR: SimWorld is a new Unreal Engine 5-based simulator for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in realistic physical and social environments, addressing limitations of existing simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents excel in math/coding but struggle in complex real-world physical/social environments. Existing simulators are limited: hand-crafted environments, simplified physics/social rules, and lack native LLM/VLM support.

Method: Built on Unreal Engine 5 with three core capabilities: 1) realistic open-ended world simulation with accurate physics/social dynamics and procedural generation, 2) rich multimodal interface for LLM/VLM agents, 3) diverse extensible reasoning scenarios.

Result: Deployed frontier LLM agents (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks, revealing distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models.

Conclusion: SimWorld provides a foundational platform for advancing real-world agent intelligence, open-sourced to enable broader development and evaluation of LLM/VLM agents in realistic environments.

Abstract: While LLM/VLM-powered AI agents have advanced rapidly in math, coding, and computer use, their applications in complex physical and social environments remain challenging. Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models. We open-source SimWorld and hope it becomes a foundational platform for advancing real-world agent intelligence across disciplines: https://simworld.org.

### [272] [Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01081)
*Stephen Fitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Consciousness emerges from communication and collective self-modeling in distributed computational systems, not from individual modeling alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis that consciousness is a functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception, and to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness.

Method: Use a layered computational model: cellular automaton as base reality, with networks of local predictive neural models that communicate and adapt. Study how collective self-models emerge from inter-agent alignment through noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages.

Result: Proposes that consciousness arises from communication between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in computational substrate, leading to shared models through representational dialogue.

Conclusion: Consciousness is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but emerges from collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization through communication, forming coherent self-referential representations.

Abstract: The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeDistiller automatically extracts working domain-specific code examples from GitHub repositories to enhance Automated Scientific Discovery systems, improving experiment quality and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASD systems are limited by either mutating few manually-crafted examples or relying solely on parametric knowledge, restricting their quality and reach. There's a need to automatically expand ASD capabilities without manual effort.

Method: CodeDistiller automatically distills large collections of scientific GitHub repositories into a vetted library of working domain-specific code examples, using a combination of automatic and domain-expert evaluation on 250 materials science repositories.

Result: The best model produces functional examples for 74% of repositories. ASD agents augmented with CodeDistiller-generated libraries produce more accurate, complete, and scientifically sound experiments than agents with only general materials-science code examples.

Conclusion: CodeDistiller successfully enables ASD systems to expand their capabilities by automatically extracting working domain-specific code from scientific repositories, overcoming limitations of current approaches and improving experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Automated Scientific Discovery (ASD) systems can help automatically generate and run code-based experiments, but their capabilities are limited by the code they can reliably generate from parametric knowledge alone. As a result, current systems either mutate a small number of manually-crafted experiment examples, or operate solely from parametric knowledge, limiting quality and reach. We introduce CodeDistiller, a system that automatically distills large collections of scientific Github repositories into a vetted library of working domain-specific code examples, allowing ASD agents to expand their capabilities without manual effort. Using a combination of automatic and domain-expert evaluation on 250 materials science repositories, we find the best model is capable of producing functional examples for 74% of repositories, while our downstream evaluation shows an ASD agent augmented with a CodeDistiller generated library produces more accurate, complete, and scientifically sound experiments than an agent with only general materials-science code examples.

*Daria Smirnova,Hamid Nasiri,Marta Adamska,Zhengxin Yu,Peter Garraghan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUIDE is an energy-aware model selection framework that improves AI orchestration by using quantitative performance data instead of qualitative descriptions, boosting accuracy and energy efficiency while drastically reducing selection latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based orchestrators use qualitative model descriptions that don't reflect true capabilities, leading to suboptimal model selection, reduced accuracy, and increased energy costs.

Method: Proposed GUIDE framework incorporates quantitative model performance characteristics and accounts for performance-energy trade-offs in decision-making, replacing qualitative descriptions with actual capability data.

Result: GUIDE increases accuracy by 0.90%-11.92% across tasks, achieves up to 54% energy efficiency improvement, and reduces orchestrator model selection latency from 4.51 seconds to 7.2 milliseconds.

Conclusion: Quantitative performance-aware orchestration frameworks like GUIDE significantly outperform current qualitative approaches, enabling more accurate, energy-efficient, and faster AI model selection for complex tasks.

Abstract: As modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more advanced and capable, they can leverage a wide range of tools and models to perform complex tasks. Today, the task of orchestrating these models is often performed by Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on qualitative descriptions of models for decision-making. However, the descriptions provided to these LLM-based orchestrators do not reflect true model capabilities and performance characteristics, leading to suboptimal model selection, reduced accuracy, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of LLM-based orchestration limitations and propose GUIDE, a new energy-aware model selection framework that accounts for performance-energy trade-offs by incorporating quantitative model performance characteristics in decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE increases accuracy by 0.90%-11.92% across various evaluated tasks, and achieves up to 54% energy efficiency improvement, while reducing orchestrator model selection latency from 4.51 s to 7.2 ms.

### [275] [Foundation Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01107)
*Sanjog Misra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models generate synthetic outputs that should be treated as draws from a "foundation prior" rather than real observations, reflecting both model patterns and user biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in using LLM-generated synthetic outputs as data in empirical research creates risk of conflating synthetic "facts" with real observations, requiring a principled framework.

Method: Introduces "foundation prior" concept as exponential-tilted generalized Bayesian update of user's primitive prior, with trust parameter weighting synthetic data; models subjectivity via user's anticipated distribution, prompt engineering, and trust in model.

Result: Framework shows how synthetic data and foundation priors can be incorporated into statistical/econometric workflows for refining models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting specifications.

Conclusion: Treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than empirical observations offers principled way to use foundation models while avoiding conflation of synthetic data with real facts.

Abstract: Foundation models, and in particular large language models, can generate highly informative responses, prompting growing interest in using these ''synthetic'' outputs as data in empirical research and decision-making. This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model.
  We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.

*Krishna Taduri,Shaunak Dhande,Giacinto Paolo,Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal AI methods outperform correlation-based ML in predictive maintenance by reducing false alarms 97% while maintaining high recall, achieving $1.16M annual savings (70.2% reduction).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive maintenance has extreme cost asymmetry (missed failures cost 50× more than false alarms), but conventional ML optimizes statistical accuracy metrics that don't reflect operational reality and can't distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations.

Method: Evaluated eight predictive models from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with 3.3% failure prevalence. Compared correlation-based models with causal AI approaches.

Result: Formal causal inference model (L5) achieved $1.16M annual savings (70.2% reduction), outperforming best correlation-based decision tree by ~$80K/year. Matched highest recall (87.9%) while reducing false alarms by 97% (165 to 5), with 92.1% precision and only 2.6% train-test gap.

Conclusion: Causal AI methods combined with domain knowledge yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments presents a challenging optimization problem characterized by extreme cost asymmetry, where missed failures incur costs roughly fifty times higher than false alarms. Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: fMRI2GES: A novel method for reconstructing co-speech gestures directly from fMRI recordings using dual brain decoding alignment with unpaired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous brain decoding research focused on image and language reconstruction, but decoding gestures associated with speech stimuli remains challenging due to lack of paired brain-speech-gesture data.

Method: Uses Dual Brain Decoding Alignment with fMRI-to-text and text-to-gesture models to train fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction on unpaired data, aligning outputs through self-supervision.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings and investigates how different cortical ROIs affect generation results.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, advancing neuroscience and cognitive science understanding of brain responses to speech stimuli.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain responds to external stimuli and decoding this process has been a significant challenge in neuroscience. While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \{brain, speech, gesture\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science.

TL;DR: KG-guided chain-of-thought framework generates clinically grounded explanations for EHR disease prediction using knowledge graphs and fine-tuned LLMs, outperforming baselines and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EHR prediction models provide coarse, post hoc explanations with limited value for patient-level decision making, lacking clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning.

Method: Map ICD-9 codes to PrimeKG knowledge graph, extract disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths as scaffolds for chain-of-thought generation, retain only explanations matching observed outcomes, then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B) on this supervision corpus.

Result: KG-guided models outperform classical baselines across ten diseases with AUROC 0.66-0.70 and macro-AUPR 0.40-0.47, transfer zero-shot to CRADLE cohort improving accuracy from ~0.40-0.51 to 0.72-0.77, and receive clinician preference for clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.

Conclusion: The KG-guided CoT framework provides clinically grounded, interpretable explanations for EHR disease prediction that enhance model transparency and support clinical decision making while maintaining strong predictive performance.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) support powerful clinical prediction models, but existing methods typically provide coarse, post hoc explanations that offer limited value for patient-level decision making. We introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that generates clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for visit-level disease prediction in MIMIC-III. ICD-9 codes are mapped to PrimeKG, from which disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths are extracted and used as scaffolds for CoT generation; only explanations whose conclusions match observed outcomes are retained. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate encoded reasoning processes in LLMs, addressing concerns about hidden reasoning that evades human oversight.

Method: Fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining English outputs, then evaluated logit lens analysis and developed unsupervised decoding pipeline combining logit lens with automated paraphrasing.

Result: Logit lens effectively translates encoded reasoning with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers; unsupervised pipeline achieves substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal representations.

Conclusion: Current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple encoded reasoning than previously understood, providing initial framework for evaluating interpretability against non-human-readable reasoning formats.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoMetric: Ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory PDFs into validated knowledge graphs using structure-aware segmentation, ontology-constrained LLM extraction, and two-phase validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG disclosure frameworks (SASB, TCFD, IFRS S2) require organizations to compute and report numerous metrics, but these requirements are embedded in long, unstructured PDF documents that are difficult to interpret, standardize, and audit. Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained LLM extraction produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability.

Result: Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure frameworks such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 require organizations to compute and report numerous metrics for compliance, yet these requirements are embedded in long, unstructured PDF documents that are difficult to interpret, standardize, and audit. Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based autonomous driving systems have multiple real-world risks, but lack systematic robustness evaluation. Need to assess whether VLMs are truly viable for safe autonomous driving deployment.

Method: 1) RoboDriveBench benchmark with 11 simulated corruption scenarios (6 sensor, 5 prompt) across 250 driving scenarios each. 2) RoboDriveVLM framework mapping lidar/radar into unified latent space. 3) Test-Time Adaptation method using cross-modal knowledge distillation.

Result: Benchmark reveals limitations of current VLM-based systems. RoboDriveVLM with TTA improves robustness against real-world corruptions, providing more reliable solution for autonomous driving deployment.

Conclusion: VLMs for autonomous driving need systematic robustness evaluation. RoboDriveBench enables comprehensive testing, while RoboDriveVLM with TTA offers enhanced robustness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems often leverage large language models to generate driving decisions directly based on their understanding of the current scene. However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment. Source code and datasets will be released.

*Shinji Mai,Yunpeng Zhai,Ziqian Chen,Cheng Chen,Anni Zou,Shuchang Tao,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CuES is a framework that automatically generates diverse, executable tasks from environment structure for agentic RL when no predefined tasks exist, using curiosity-driven exploration and task schema abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task scarcity is a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL - many realistic environments lack predefined training tasks, especially when tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. Existing approaches assume predefined task collections, which fails in novel environments.

Method: CuES (Curiosity-driven and Environment-grounded Synthesis) autonomously generates tasks directly from environment structure and affordances without handcrafted seeds or external corpora. It uses intrinsic curiosity for exploration, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top-down guidance and memory-based quality control.

Result: Across three environments (AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop), CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven, environment-grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn, addressing the task scarcity problem in agentic RL.

Abstract: Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

*Juan Hernandez,Diego Fernández,Manuel Cifuentes,Denis Parra,Rodrigo Toro Icarte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Never Give Up (NGU) algorithm to multi-agent environments, showing improved performance over multi-agent DQN baseline through shared replay buffers and careful tuning of intrinsic exploration signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the effective single-agent NGU algorithm (which combines episodic novelty and intrinsic motivation for sparse reward tasks) to multi-agent environments, addressing the challenge of exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Extends NGU to multi-agent settings and evaluates in simple_tag environment from PettingZoo. Investigates three design choices: (1) shared vs individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents with different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous vs common beta parameter values.

Result: NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics compared to multi-agent DQN baseline. Shared replay buffer yields best performance and stability. Novelty sharing works comparably when k=1 but degrades for larger k values. Heterogeneous beta values don't improve over small common value.

Conclusion: NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared (via shared replay buffer) and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned, with gains coming from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing.

Abstract: The Never Give Up (NGU) algorithm has proven effective in reinforcement learning tasks with sparse rewards by combining episodic novelty and intrinsic motivation. In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned.

*Saman Ahmadi,Mahdi Jalili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Energy-optimal profile search for EVs using multi-objective A* with novel dominance rules, achieving performance comparable to known-initial-energy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world EV routing often involves uncertainty in initial energy levels, requiring planning for all possible energy states rather than assuming a known initial charge.

Method: Proposes a label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search with novel profile dominance rules to avoid complex profile handling, developing four variants of this method.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world road networks with realistic energy consumption data shows the energy profile A* search achieves performance comparable to energy-optimal A* with known initial energy levels.

Conclusion: The proposed simple yet effective label-setting approach with novel dominance rules successfully addresses energy-optimal profile search for EVs without requiring complex profile management.

Abstract: We study the energy-optimal shortest path problem for electric vehicles (EVs) in large-scale road networks, where recuperated energy along downhill segments introduces negative energy costs. While traditional point-to-point pathfinding algorithms for EVs assume a known initial energy level, many real-world scenarios involving uncertainty in available energy require planning optimal paths for all possible initial energy levels, a task known as energy-optimal profile search. Existing solutions typically rely on specialized profile-merging procedures within a label-correcting framework that results in searching over complex profiles. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search, which employs a novel profile dominance rule to avoid generating and handling complex profiles. We develop four variants of our method and evaluate them on real-world road networks enriched with realistic energy consumption data. Experimental results demonstrate that our energy profile A* search achieves performance comparable to energy-optimal A* with a known initial energy level.

*Elinor Poole-Dayan,Jiayi Wu,Taylor Sorensen,Jiaxin Pei,Michiel A. Bakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for measuring viewpoint diversity in LLMs using a coverage metric (OvertonScore), validated through human studies and automated benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack diverse viewpoint representation (pluralism), and there's a need for scalable evaluation tools since repeated large-scale human studies are costly and slow.

Method: Formalized Overton pluralism as a set coverage metric (OvertonScore), conducted large-scale U.S.-representative human study (N=1209, 60 questions, 8 LLMs), and developed an automated benchmark that reproduces human judgments.

Result: Models achieved OvertonScores of 0.35-0.41 (DeepSeek V3 best), far below theoretical maximum of 1.0. Automated benchmark achieved high rank correlation with human judgments (ρ=0.88).

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for systematic progress toward more pluralistic LLMs by turning pluralistic alignment into a measurable benchmark, with automated tools providing practical proxies for scalable evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for measuring Overton pluralism in LLMs--the extent to which diverse viewpoints are represented in model outputs. We (i) formalize Overton pluralism as a set coverage metric (OvertonScore), (ii) conduct a large-scale U.S.-representative human study (N = 1209; 60 questions; 8 LLMs), and (iii) develop an automated benchmark that closely reproduces human judgments. On average, models achieve OvertonScores of 0.35--0.41, with DeepSeek V3 performing best; yet all models remain far below the theoretical maximum of 1.0, revealing substantial headroom for improvement. Because repeated large-scale human studies are costly and slow, scalable evaluation tools are essential for model development. Hence, we propose an automated benchmark that achieves high rank correlation with human judgments ($ρ=0.88$), providing a practical proxy without replacing human assessment. By turning pluralistic alignment from a normative aim into a measurable benchmark, our work establishes a foundation for systematic progress toward more pluralistic LLMs.

*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Synthetic data optimized for statistical smoothness removes human-like irregularities, accelerating model collapse. Proposed cognitive simulation approach generates text with human imperfections, validated through market stress tests showing significant risk reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data production focuses on statistical smoothness but systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text, which accelerates model collapse. There's a need for synthetic data that preserves human cognitive characteristics rather than just surface properties.

Method: Proposes Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF) with two core components: Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.

Result: CTE text shows Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment. In A-share market stress tests, strategies using CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by factor of 33.

Conclusion: Modelling human cognitive limitations rather than copying surface data enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating tools for complex iterative problems that align with human intent while minimizing the time and effort required for task/domain adaptation and human feedback capture.

Method: A flexible multi-agent LLM framework with four specialized agents (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) using reinforced dynamic prompts and systematic human feedback integration.

Result: Preliminary experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to generate state-of-the-art research papers or patents given an abstract, showing applicability to complex iterative problem-solving tasks.

Conclusion: CollabToolBuilder represents a system-level integration methodology that effectively combines multi-agent learning with human guidance for creating tools that solve complex iterative problems while aligning with human intent and processes.

Abstract: We introduce CollabToolBuilder, a flexible multiagent LLM framework with expert-in-the-loop (HITL) guidance that iteratively learns to create tools for a target goal, aligning with human intent and process, while minimizing time for task/domain adaptation effort and human feedback capture. The architecture generates and validates tools via four specialized agents (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) using a reinforced dynamic prompt and systematic human feedback integration to reinforce each agent's role toward goals and constraints. This work is best viewed as a system-level integration and methodology combining multi-agent in-context learning, HITL controls, and reusable tool capitalization for complex iterative problems such as scientific document generation. We illustrate it with preliminary experiments (e.g., generating state-of-the-art research papers or patents given an abstract) and discuss its applicability to other iterative problem-solving.

### [288] [A Selective Temporal Hamming distance to find patterns in state transition event timeseries, at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01440)
*Sylvain Marié,Pablo Knecht*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes STE-ts (state transition event timeseries) and STH (Selective Temporal Hamming distance) for analyzing discrete event systems without costly resampling, leveraging both transition timing and state durations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard analysis of discrete event systems fails to exploit their dual event/state nature - either focusing on event sequences (ignoring state durations) or categorical timeseries (requiring distorting resampling). Need a method that avoids costly resampling while capturing both transition timing and duration-in-state information.

Method: Defines STE-ts (state transition event timeseries) and proposes STH (Selective Temporal Hamming distance) that directly operates on event transitions without resampling. STH considers both transition times and durations in states, generalizing resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics.

Result: STH provides better precision and computation time compared to resampled approaches, can focus on multiple states of interest, and avoids distortion from resampling. Validated on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed STE-ts and STH framework effectively analyzes discrete event systems by leveraging their dual nature without costly resampling, offering improved performance and flexibility for large databases.

Abstract: Discrete event systems are present both in observations of nature, socio economical sciences, and industrial systems. Standard analysis approaches do not usually exploit their dual event / state nature: signals are either modeled as transition event sequences, emphasizing event order alignment, or as categorical or ordinal state timeseries, usually resampled a distorting and costly operation as the observation period and number of events grow. In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest. We validate these benefits on simulated and real-world datasets.

*Lingbo Li,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPA uses structured code-based optimization with Pareto-guided search to automate risk of bias assessment in RCTs, outperforming manual prompts in accuracy and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RoB assessment is resource-intensive and variable across reviewers, while existing LLM automation methods rely on non-reproducible manual prompts that are difficult to evaluate.

Method: Programmable RoB assessment pipeline using DSPy and GEPA module that replaces ad-hoc prompts with structured code-based optimization, using Pareto-guided search to refine LLM reasoning with inspectable execution traces.

Result: GEPA-generated prompts performed best in domains with clear methodological reporting (Random Sequence Generation), with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding. GEPA achieved highest overall accuracy, improving performance by 30-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting compared to manual prompts.

Conclusion: GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis with transparent optimization processes.

Abstract: Assessing risk of bias (RoB) in randomized controlled trials is essential for trustworthy evidence synthesis, but the process is resource-intensive and prone to variability across reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M3PO introduces multi-path collaborative reinforcement learning to overcome deterministic reasoning limitations in Chain-of-Thought, achieving SOTA performance while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Chain-of-Thought reasoning exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods using soft abstract tokens remain constrained by greedy autoregressive decoding that isolates models from alternative reasoning possibilities.

Method: Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO) - a reinforcement learning framework that uses parallel policy rollouts as diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions through a lightweight collaborative mechanism, allowing trajectories to refine reasoning with peer feedback.

Result: M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Multi-path collaborative learning shows promise for robust reasoning by overcoming deterministic limitations of conventional Chain-of-Thought approaches while preserving interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.

TL;DR: LLMs translate synthetic chemistry strategies into Python code for computer-assisted synthesis planning, enabling strategic route analysis beyond just chemical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CASP systems generate chemically valid reactions but lack strategic considerations like convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences.

Method: Leverage Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into Python functions representing strategic/tactical rules, creating verifiable code rather than simple heuristics.

Result: Achieved 75% Top-3 accuracy on natural language-based route retrieval benchmark, released USPTO-ST dataset with strategic annotations, and demonstrated chemically intuitive route clustering.

Conclusion: Bridges tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of synthesis routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.

Abstract: Modern computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) systems show promises at generating chemically valid reaction steps but struggle to incorporate strategic considerations such as convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences. We introduce a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into code. Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Aniri,Tianlong Chen,Yue Zhang,Heng Tao Shen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LEC is a method for controlling false discovery rate in LLM predictions using linear expectation constraints and calibration samples, with a two-model routing extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate unreliable answers, and existing uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, lacking statistical guarantees for error control.

Method: Proposes LEC which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem with Linear Expectation Constraints, establishes finite-sample sufficient conditions using calibration samples, and extends to two-model routing with unified FDR guarantees.

Result: LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods on QA datasets; two-model routing achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than individual models.

Conclusion: LEC provides a principled approach to FDR control for LLM predictions with statistical guarantees, and the routing mechanism enhances performance by leveraging multiple models while maintaining unified error control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.

TL;DR: Proposes CLIP-inspired method aligning language instructions with policy embeddings for efficient multi-task RL transfer


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for agents that can solve multiple language-associated tasks in same environment; leverage pre-trained language-policy pairs for efficient transfer

Method: Extends CLIP principles to RL: creates unified representation space where language instructions and corresponding policies (representing same task concept) have similar embeddings

Result: Experimental results show algorithm achieves faster transfer across tasks

Conclusion: CLIP-inspired alignment of language and policy representations enables efficient multi-task transfer in RL

Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing need to develop agents capable of solving multiple tasks within the same environment, especially when these tasks are naturally associated with language. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical event modeling faces extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous/noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the need for human-interpretable explanations, which traditional ML approaches cannot adequately address.

Method: Probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework integrating: (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning, (3) Shapley values for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention-based neural architectures for context-dependent factor weighting.

Result: Identified Germany's +107.9% discrepancy as structural tension preceding WWI (tension factor 36.43, 0.79 naval arms race correlation). For Punic Wars: 57.3% Carthage win probability at Cannae, 57.8% Rome win probability at Zama. Counterfactual analysis shows Carthaginian political support (score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1) was decisive factor rather than military capability.

Conclusion: HistoricalML provides a principled framework for historical analysis that handles sparse data, quantifies uncertainty, enables counterfactual reasoning, and delivers interpretable explanations with theoretical guarantees on estimation consistency and fairness.

Abstract: Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are integrated into high-stakes domains, there's a need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. Human evaluation is reliable but slow and costly, while single LLM judges are biased and static juries lack adaptability.

Method: Trains reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts using token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. For each data point, dynamically selects an optimal jury of the most reliable judges and aggregates their scores using reliability as weights.

Result: Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show the dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated into high-stakes domains, there is a growing need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: A sparse subset of neurons (<0.1% of total) reliably predicts hallucinations in LLMs, causally linked to over-compliance behaviors, originating from pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently generate hallucinations (plausible but factually incorrect outputs), undermining reliability. While prior work examined macroscopic perspectives, neuron-level mechanisms remain unexplored.

Method: Systematic investigation of hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) from three perspectives: identification (finding sparse neuron subsets that predict hallucinations), behavioral impact (controlled interventions to test causal links), and origins (tracing neurons back to pre-trained base models).

Result: Remarkably sparse subset of neurons (<0.1% of total) reliably predicts hallucination occurrences with strong generalization across scenarios. These neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. They originate from pre-trained base models and remain predictive for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs by understanding neuron-level origins of hallucinations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.

*Alessandro Breccia,Federica Gerace,Marco Lippi,Gabriele Sicuro,Pierluigi Contucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can learn deterministic tree sequences from iterated prime factorization of natural numbers, capturing arithmetic structure beyond empirical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models can learn deterministic mathematical structures, specifically the sequence of trees generated by iterated prime factorization of natural numbers, extending learnability beyond empirical data to arithmetic structure itself.

Method: Map integers to rooted planar trees to create sequence $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, train GPT-2 transformer from scratch on first $10^{11}$ elements, test predictive ability using next-word and masked-word prediction tasks.

Result: The model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations in the deterministic tree sequence.

Conclusion: Learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic, as LLMs can capture mathematical regularities in deterministic sequences.

Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect neuroscience principles (Free Energy Principle) to knowledge graph reasoning by using surprise minimization, where closer entities have lower surprise than distant ones.

Method: Formalizes surprise using shortest-path distance in directed graphs, creating a framework for KG-based agents where graph distance relates to message passing depth and world model trajectories.

Result: Work-in-progress study exploring whether distance-based surprise can extend recent findings that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel connection between neuroscience's Free Energy Principle and knowledge graph reasoning through surprise minimization based on graph distance, with potential extensions to syntax and tree structures.

Abstract: In this work, we propose that reasoning in knowledge graph (KG) networks can be guided by surprise minimization. Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories. This work-in-progress study explores whether distance-based surprise can extend recent work showing that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures.

*Daren Zhong,Dingcheng Huang,Clayton Greenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A chess move prediction framework using n-gram language models tailored to different skill levels, achieving up to 39.1% accuracy improvement over benchmarks with real-time computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chess engines focus on optimal moves but neglect human variability across skill levels. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a move prediction framework that accounts for behavioral patterns specific to different player skill levels.

Method: Proposes a computationally efficient framework using n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific skill levels. Players are divided into seven skill groups (novice to expert), with separate models trained on Lichess data. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks based on preceding move sequences.

Result: The model selector achieves up to 31.7% accuracy in classifying skill levels using early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework shows substantial improvements, with Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1% more accurate than benchmark accuracy. The framework is computationally efficient for real-time analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitation of traditional chess engines by incorporating skill-level-specific behavioral patterns, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements in move prediction while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time chess analysis.

Abstract: Chess, a deterministic game with perfect information, has long served as a benchmark for studying strategic decision-making and artificial intelligence. Traditional chess engines or tools for analysis primarily focus on calculating optimal moves, often neglecting the variability inherent in human chess playing, particularly across different skill levels.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel and computationally efficient move prediction framework that approaches chess move prediction as a behavioral analysis task. The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences.
  Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy. The computational efficiency of the framework further enhances its suitability for real-time chess analysis.

*Jie Meng,Jin Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are limited as general evaluators due to reliance on human-designed rules. This paper proposes a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm with automatic rule distillation and two strategies to help LLMs apply learned rules effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based evaluators struggle to generalize across diverse tasks because they depend on costly, human-designed evaluation principles that are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding. There's a need for more scalable and aligned evaluation methods.

Method: Proposes a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm with two key components: (1) Rule distillation using LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically extract scoring rules from data, and (2) Two strategies to help LLMs apply rules: Chain-of-Rule (CoR) guidance and training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach across various evaluation scenarios, showing improved alignment with data and better scalability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed rule-augmented evaluation paradigm successfully addresses limitations of current LLM-based evaluators by automatically learning rules from data and effectively integrating them with LLMs' reasoning, enabling more generalizable evaluation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used as evaluators for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, but their application to broader evaluation scenarios remains limited. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios.

*Sitao Cheng,Xunjian Yin,Ruiwen Zhou,Yuxuan Li,Xinyi Wang,Liangming Pan,William Yang Wang,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL synthesizes new reasoning strategies from atomic skills, not just amplifies existing behaviors, enabling better out-of-distribution generalization for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether RL contributes to reasoning by synthesizing new skills or merely amplifying existing behaviors, using Complementary Reasoning as a test case.

Method: Used controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, decoupled Complementary Reasoning into Parametric (internal knowledge) and Contextual (external info) atomic skills. Evaluated generalization across I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. Compared SFT vs RL approaches.

Result: SFT achieves near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapses on O.O.D. generalization (SFT Generalization Paradox). RL acts as reasoning synthesizer but requires atomic skill mastery via SFT first. RL can synthesize complex strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on complex tasks.

Conclusion: RL is a reasoning synthesizer, not just an amplifier. Decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks, challenging the view of RL as mere probability amplifier.

Abstract: The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain of Ground (CoG) is a training-free multi-step grounding framework that uses multimodal LLMs for iterative visual reasoning to improve GUI grounding accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with GUI grounding tasks involving small/visually similar targets and ambiguous real-world layouts due to limited grounding capacity and underutilized reasoning potential.

Method: CoG uses iterative visual reasoning and refinement where the model progressively reflects and adjusts hypotheses instead of making direct predictions, enabling more accurate and interpretable localization without additional training.

Result: Achieves 68.4% accuracy on ScreenSpot Pro benchmark (4.8 point improvement) and on TPanel UI dataset (420 industrial control panels with distortions), improves over Qwen3 VL 235B baseline by 6.9 points.

Conclusion: Structured iterative refinement unlocks grounding potential without additional training, demonstrating effectiveness across both real-world and digital interfaces through interpretable multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM CHESS is an evaluation framework that tests LLMs' reasoning and instruction-following abilities through extended chess gameplay, ranking over 50 models and revealing that many state-of-the-art models struggle despite simple tasks, with unique advantages over static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in LLMs through extended agentic interaction in chess, addressing limitations of static benchmarks that are prone to overfitting and memorization.

Method: Created LLM CHESS framework where models play against random opponents, evaluated using behavioral metrics (win/loss rates, move quality, legality, hallucinations, game duration). For top models, derived Elo estimates by playing against variably configured chess engines.

Result: Ranked over 50 open/closed source models, revealing clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins despite simple tasks. The framework reduces overfitting and prevents benchmark saturation.

Conclusion: LLM CHESS provides a unique dynamic evaluation that better tests reasoning generalization than static benchmarks, proving difficult even for top models. The framework, leaderboard, and game dataset are released to support future research on LLM reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework designed to probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in large language models (LLMs) through extended agentic interaction in the domain of chess. We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games.

*Agniprabha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DREAMer-VXS is a model-based RL framework for AGV exploration that learns world models from LiDAR data and trains policies in imagination, achieving 90% reduction in real-world interactions and 45% better exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-free RL for robotics suffers from sample inefficiency and brittleness, hindering real-world deployment. Need for more efficient and robust approaches that reduce environmental interactions.

Method: Combines Convolutional VAE for environment representation learning with Recurrent State-Space Model for temporal dynamics. Uses learned world model as simulator for imagination-based policy training with actor-critic optimization and composite reward (task objectives + intrinsic curiosity).

Result: 90% reduction in required environmental interactions compared to model-free SAC baselines, 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments, superior resilience to dynamic obstacles, and faster learning with more generalizable policies.

Conclusion: Model-based approach with imagination-based training enables efficient and robust AGV exploration, significantly reducing real-world interaction requirements while improving generalization and resilience.

Abstract: The paradigm of learning-based robotics holds immense promise, yet its translation to real-world applications is critically hindered by the sample inefficiency and brittleness of conventional model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles.

Abstract: With the accelerating availability of multimodal surgical data and real-time computation, Surgical Digital Twins (SDTs) have emerged as virtual counterparts that mirror, predict, and inform decisions across pre-, intra-, and postoperative care. Despite promising demonstrations, SDTs face persistent challenges: fusing heterogeneous imaging, kinematics, and physiology under strict latency budgets; balancing model fidelity with computational efficiency; ensuring robustness, interpretability, and calibrated uncertainty; and achieving interoperability, privacy, and regulatory compliance in clinical environments.

TL;DR: XFlowMP is a task-conditioned generative motion planner that uses Schrödinger bridges to generate smooth, collision-free, and dynamically-feasible robot trajectories by bridging stochastic noises with expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planning methods struggle to integrate high-level task semantics with low-level motion constraints, particularly the connection between task configurations and motion controllability. There's a need for generative planners that can produce feasible trajectories across diverse tasks while respecting dynamic constraints.

Method: XFlowMP models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows using Schrödinger bridges conditioned on task configurations. It combines conditional flow matching with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions.

Result: On RobotPointMass benchmark: 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, 39.88% lower energy consumption, and 11.72% faster short-horizon planning. On LASA Handwriting dataset: 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother trajectories, 31.97% lower energy. Successfully demonstrated on Kinova Gen3 manipulator in real-world settings.

Conclusion: XFlowMP effectively bridges high-level task semantics with low-level motion constraints through Schrödinger bridge-based generative planning, producing superior quality trajectories with better smoothness, energy efficiency, and planning speed compared to existing methods, while maintaining real-world practicality.

Abstract: Generative robotic motion planning requires not only the synthesis of smooth and collision-free trajectories but also feasibility across diverse tasks and dynamic constraints. Prior planning methods, both traditional and generative, often struggle to incorporate high-level semantics with low-level constraints, especially the nexus between task configurations and motion controllability. In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method on the Kinova Gen3 manipulator, executing planning motions and confirming its robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot learning by better leveraging abundant human demonstration videos available online.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality data for training large-scale robotic models typically relies on real robot platforms, which is labor-intensive and costly, whether via teleoperation or scripted demonstrations.

We review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape. Through this survey, we aim to provide a thorough resource that inspires further research at the intersection of VLN and robotics. We advocate that the future VLN systems should support proactive clarification, real-time feedback, and contextual reasoning through advanced natural language understanding (NLU) techniques. Additionally, decentralized decision-making frameworks with dynamic role assignment are essential for scalable, efficient multi-robot collaboration. These innovations can significantly enhance human-robot interaction (HRI) and enable real-world deployment in domains such as healthcare, logistics, and disaster response.

Recently, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) has shown promising results in some challenging autonomous navigation tasks without prior environmental information. However, these methods overlook situations where noise patterns vary across different environmental conditions, hindering safe navigation and disrupting the learning of value functions. To address the problem, we propose DRIQN to integrate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with implicit quantile networks to optimize worst-case performance under natural environmental conditions. Leveraging explicit subgroup modeling in the replay buffer, DRIQN incorporates heterogeneous noise sources and target robustness-critical scenarios. Experimental results based on the risk-sensitive environment demonstrate that DRIQN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving +13.51\% success rate, -12.28\% collision rate and +35.46\% for time saving, +27.99\% for energy saving, compared with the runner-up.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ICD-Net enhances visual-inertial SLAM by learning displacement estimates from raw inertial data with uncertainty quantification, integrated into VINS-Fusion to improve drone trajectory accuracy by over 38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-inertial SLAM systems suffer from suboptimal performance due to imperfect sensor calibration, noisy measurements, rapid motion, low illumination, and limitations of traditional inertial integration methods, especially problematic for drone applications requiring robust state estimation.

Method: ICD-Net learns to process raw inertial measurements to generate displacement estimates with uncertainty quantification, replacing analytical sensor models. The framework integrates these outputs as additional residual constraints into VINS-Fusion optimization, where predicted uncertainties appropriately weight neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms.

Result: Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences showed more than 38% improvement in mean APE (Absolute Pose Error) compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. The method works under both normal conditions and during camera inconsistency or visual degradation.

Conclusion: Neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements, demonstrating that learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the visual-inertial SLAM pipeline.

Abstract: Visual-inertial SLAM systems often exhibit suboptimal performance due to multiple confounding factors including imperfect sensor calibration, noisy measurements, rapid motion dynamics, low illumination, and the inherent limitations of traditional inertial navigation integration methods. These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.

*Yanjia Huang,Xianshun Jiang,Xiangbo Gao,Mingyang Wu,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VISTAv2 is a generative world model for Vision-and-Language Navigation that synthesizes action-conditioned future views and converts them into online value maps for planning, improving navigation performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VLN methods using image imagination lack online, action-conditioned predictions and explicit planning values, often replacing planners with brittle long-horizon objectives. There's a need for more robust and interpretable planning approaches in continuous real-world navigation.

Method: Uses an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer to synthesize short-horizon future views conditioned on past observations, candidate actions, and instructions. Aligns synthesized views with instructions via vision-language scoring, fuses multiple rollouts through a differentiable imagination-to-value head to produce an egocentric value map for planning.

Result: VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines on MP3D and RoboTHOR benchmarks. Ablations demonstrate that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical components for performance.

Conclusion: VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN by maintaining the planner while providing reachability and risk-aware guidance through online value maps generated from action-conditioned imagination.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow language instructions while acting in continuous real-world spaces. Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN.

TL;DR: CRL integrates causal discovery with RL for interpretable, data-efficient decision-making in adaptive healthcare interventions like dementia care, outperforming conventional RL in simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL struggles in adaptive healthcare due to data scarcity, need for interpretability, and complex causal patient-state dynamics, especially in applications like dementia care where decisions must be clinically meaningful and transparent.

Method: Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization, learning a DAG of causal dependencies between behavioral states and robot actions for more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

Result: CRL outperforms conventional model-free RL baselines with higher cumulative rewards, more consistent maintenance of desirable patient states, and clinically-aligned interpretable behavior; remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameters; enables lightweight LLM-based deployment without finetuning.

Conclusion: CRL demonstrates promise for human-robot interaction applications where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are crucial, particularly in healthcare interventions requiring transparent and clinically meaningful decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces significant challenges in adaptive healthcare interventions, such as dementia care, where data is scarce, decisions require interpretability, and underlying patient-state dynamic are complex and causal in nature. In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount.

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches for socially aware robot navigation, covering algorithms, neural architectures, evaluation methods, and identifying key challenges like standardization and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Socially aware navigation enables robots to move in human environments while respecting social norms. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to address the need for robots that can navigate effectively while maintaining human comfort and acceptance.

Method: Conducted a systematic survey and comparative analysis of DRL-based socially aware navigation approaches. Examined value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic RL algorithms combined with various neural network architectures (feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, transformers). Analyzed evaluation mechanisms including metrics, datasets, and simulation environments.

Result: DRL significantly improves safety and human acceptance over traditional approaches. However, the field faces challenges including non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, lack of standardized social metrics, computational limitations for scalability, and difficulties in sim-to-real transfer. Hybrid approaches show promise for future progress.

Conclusion: Future progress depends on hybrid approaches leveraging multiple methods and developing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation. Standardization of evaluation metrics and improved sim-to-real transfer are critical for advancing socially aware navigation.

Abstract: Socially aware navigation is a fast-evolving research area in robotics that enables robots to move within human environments while adhering to the implicit human social norms. The advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has accelerated the development of navigation policies that enable robots to incorporate these social conventions while effectively reaching their objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications. We assert that future progress will depend on hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple approaches and producing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation.

*Suzie Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLIHF uses EEG signals (ErrPs) as implicit human feedback for RL, eliminating need for explicit feedback mechanisms and achieving comparable performance to dense reward functions in robotic pick-and-place tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL struggles with sparse rewards, requiring complex manual reward design. Existing RLHF methods rely on explicit feedback (button presses, preference labels) that disrupt natural interaction and impose cognitive load on users.

Method: Proposes RLIHF framework using non-invasive EEG signals (error-related potentials) as continuous implicit feedback. Uses pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG into probabilistic reward components, enabling policy learning with sparse external rewards. Evaluated in MuJoCo simulation with Kinova Gen2 robotic arm performing complex pick-and-place with obstacle avoidance.

Result: Agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards in the robotic manipulation task.

Conclusion: Implicit neural feedback via EEG signals provides scalable, human-aligned reinforcement learning for interactive robotics, eliminating need for explicit user intervention while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cascade PID+PD controller enables independent radial distance control of multiple magnetic microrobots using only global magnetic field angle, achieving 40% faster convergence with smooth ±5° orientation changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing magnetic microrobot systems only allow synchronous movement of all agents, limiting applications like targeted drug delivery and microsurgeries that require differentiated actuation of multiple microrobots under shared global signals.

Method: Developed physical model considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and viscous media velocities, then implemented cascade control: PID controller for radial distance regulation followed by PD controller to smooth magnetic field orientation changes, simulated in MATLAB.

Result: PID controller reduced convergence time to desired radius by ~40%, and PID+PD cascade achieved smooth angular trajectories with only ±5° fluctuations within similar timeframes, enabling fast and precise radial distance control without abrupt field orientation changes.

Conclusion: Feasibility validated for controlling two microrobots' radial distance using shared magnetic field, but limited to 2D and two agents; future work needed for 3D systems and multiple agents.

Abstract: The independent control of multiple magnetic microrobots under a shared global signal presents critical challenges in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and microsurgeries. Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle ψof a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \pm 5^\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents.

TL;DR: AEDGA algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-trip picking robot scheduling in smart orchards by using adaptive experience-based genetic algorithm with clustering-based local search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart orchards need automated harvesting to address labor shortages, but multi-robot scheduling is complex due to makespan constraints, robot weight-load-energy interdependencies, and computational challenges. Existing metaheuristics suffer from redundant local operations causing slow search and local optima.

Method: Proposed adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) with: 1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization, 2) clustering-based local search mechanism, 3) experience-based adaptive selection strategy, and 4) solution repair strategy for makespan feasibility.

Result: AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems.

Conclusion: The AEDGA approach effectively solves the complex MTPRTS problem in smart orchards by overcoming limitations of existing metaheuristics through adaptive experience-based optimization and specialized local search mechanisms.

Abstract: The continuous innovation of smart robotic technologies is driving the development of smart orchards, significantly enhancing the potential for automated harvesting systems. While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems demonstrate that AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpeedAug: RL-based framework that accelerates robotic policies without additional demonstrations by pre-training on speed-augmented data to improve sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic policies often execute slower than hardware capabilities allow, and existing acceleration methods suffer from distributional shifts. RL can adapt policies faster but is sample inefficient due to unguided exploration.

Method: SpeedAug pre-trains a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations to create a behavior prior with diverse execution tempos, then uses RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy for efficient adaptation.

Result: Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show significant improvement in sample efficiency over existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rates.

Conclusion: SpeedAug effectively accelerates robotic policies without additional demonstrations by leveraging tempo-enriched behavior priors to guide RL exploration, achieving both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic policy learning have enabled complex manipulation in real-world environments, yet the execution speed of these policies often lags behind hardware capabilities due to the cost of collecting faster demonstrations. Existing works on policy acceleration reinterpret action sequence for unseen execution speed, thereby encountering distributional shifts from the original demonstrations. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that adapts policies for faster execution without additional demonstration, but its unguided exploration is sample inefficient. We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate.

TL;DR: Combining LLM commonsense with symbolic planning improves robot task success by generating missing preconditions and subgoals from natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often fail at everyday tasks because natural language instructions skip commonsense details like hidden preconditions and small subgoals, which traditional symbolic planners require to be explicitly written, making planning time-consuming and incomplete.

Method: Combine a Large Language Model with symbolic planning: given a natural language task, the LLM suggests plausible preconditions and subgoals, which are then translated into a formal planning model and executed in simulation.

Result: Compared to a baseline planner without the LLM step, the system produces more valid plans, achieves higher task success rate, and adapts better when the environment changes.

Conclusion: Adding LLM commonsense to classical planning can make robot behavior in realistic scenarios more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D visual pre-training methods underperform on robotic manipulation due to lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction.

Method: AFRO casts state prediction as generative diffusion process, jointly models forward/inverse dynamics in shared latent space, uses feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision to prevent feature leakage.

Result: Substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforms existing pre-training approaches, scales favorably with data volume and task complexity.

Conclusion: AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics without action or reconstruction supervision.

Abstract: Despite strong results on recognition and segmentation, current 3D visual pre-training methods often underperform on robotic manipulation. We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

TL;DR: Arcadia is a closed-loop framework for embodied lifelong learning that couples four non-decomposable stages: autonomous data acquisition, generative scene reconstruction, shared multimodal representation, and simulation-based adaptation, enabling continuous improvement and generalization in physical robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied learning is fundamentally a lifecycle problem rather than single-stage optimization. Current systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings.

Method: Arcadia framework with four tightly coupled stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic scene creation, (3) Shared embodied representation architecture unifying navigation and manipulation in a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution closing the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation.

Result: Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots. The framework supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization through continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning.

Conclusion: A tightly coupled lifecycle approach (continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning) supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization for embodied agents. Arcadia provides a scalable foundation for general-purpose embodied agents with standardized interfaces for reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: We contend that embodied learning is fundamentally a lifecycle problem rather than a single-stage optimization. Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation. This coupling is non-decomposable: removing any stage breaks the improvement loop and reverts to one-shot training. Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization.

*Bowen Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical control architecture combining learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing enables stable humanoid walking with Supernumerary Limbs by using SLs for dynamic balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supernumerary Limbs on humanoid robots introduce dynamic perturbations that challenge stability during locomotion, requiring novel control approaches to maintain balance.

Method: Decoupled hierarchical control with low-level imitation learning for gait generation and high-level model-based balancing using SLs for dynamic stabilization.

Result: Dynamic balancing controller improves stability, reduces CoM trajectory DTW distance by 47% vs static payload, improves gait pattern similarity to baseline, and achieves coordinated anti-phase GRF patterns.

Conclusion: Decoupled hierarchical design effectively mitigates internal dynamic disturbances from SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional supernumerary limbs.

Abstract: The integration of Supernumerary Limbs (SLs) on humanoid robots poses a significant stability challenge due to the dynamic perturbations they introduce. This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF). The results demonstrate that a decoupled, hierarchical design can effectively mitigate the internal dynamic disturbances arising from the mass and movement of the SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional limbs.

*Pei Zhou,Wanting Yao,Qian Luo,Xunzhe Zhou,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hyper-GoalNet uses hypernetworks to generate task-specific policy parameters from goal specifications, separating goal interpretation from state processing with dual constraints for better manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal-conditioned policy learning for robotic manipulation struggles to maintain performance across diverse objectives and environments, especially with high variability and environmental randomization.

Method: Hypernetwork framework that generates policy network parameters from goal specifications, separating goal interpretation from state processing. Uses two constraints: (1) forward dynamics model for state transition predictability, and (2) distance-based constraint for monotonic progression toward goals.

Result: Significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions. Real-world robotic experiments validate robustness to sensor noise and physical uncertainties.

Conclusion: Hyper-GoalNet effectively addresses challenges in goal-conditioned manipulation by generating task-specific policies through hypernetworks with complementary constraints, demonstrating superior performance and real-world robustness.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned policy learning for robotic manipulation presents significant challenges in maintaining performance across diverse objectives and environments. We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions. Real-world robotic experiments further validate our method's robustness to sensor noise and physical uncertainties. Code is available at: https://github.com/wantingyao/hyper-goalnet.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using chin-mounted camera data to detect robot errors via facial reactions, outperforming traditional methods like OpenFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots lack the ability to perceive subtle social cues (like raised eyebrows or laughter) that humans use to recognize and correct social missteps, limiting their social competence and integration into human environments.

Method: Developed a neck-mounted device to capture facial expressions from the chin region, created NeckNet-18 (3D facial reconstruction model) to map reactions onto facial points/head motion, then built a robot error detection model using these facial responses.

Result: The robot error detection model using chin camera data outperformed standard methods (OpenFace or video data), with particularly strong generalization for within-participant data.

Conclusion: Argues for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing to better capture social cues, enabling more seamless robot integration into human environments and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.

Abstract: How do humans recognize and rectify social missteps? We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.

TL;DR: MILE is a teleoperation system for dexterous hand manipulation that eliminates motion retargeting through mechanical isomorphism and integrates high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing, enabling efficient collection of multimodal manipulation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for dexterous hand manipulation is limited by lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data due to inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing in existing systems.

Method: Developed MILE - a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation system with anthropometrically derived exoskeleton (sub-1° angular error) and robotic hand preserving one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting. Integrated compact fingertip visuotactile modules for high-resolution tactile observations.

Result: Teleoperation pipeline achieved 64% mean success rate improvement. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations increased success rate by average 25% over vision-only baseline. Efficiently collected multimodal dataset with visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions.

Conclusion: MILE's retargeting-free interface with high-fidelity tactile sensing enables precise natural control and collection of high-quality multimodal data, significantly improving dexterous manipulation performance and validating the utility of tactile observations.

Abstract: Imitation learning provides a promising approach to dexterous hand manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data. Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

TL;DR: DPNet integrates Doppler LiDAR with motion planning to handle rapid-motion obstacles using Doppler model-based learning, achieving high-frequency, high-accuracy tracking and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning methods struggle with rapid-motion obstacles due to insufficient understanding of environmental changes. Doppler LiDAR provides both ranging measurements and instantaneous point velocities, but integration requires both high accuracy and high frequency.

Method: Proposes Doppler Planning Network (DPNet) with two components: 1) Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track future obstacle states under partially observable Gaussian state space model, and 2) Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework that uses estimated motions for ego-motion planning with runtime auto-tuning of controller parameters.

Result: Experiments on high-fidelity simulator and real-world datasets demonstrate DPNet's superiority over extensive benchmark schemes. The approach maintains lightweight architecture while learning fast environmental changes with minimum data.

Conclusion: DPNet successfully integrates Doppler LiDAR with motion planning to handle rapid-motion obstacles, achieving both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning through model-based learning with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Existing motion planning methods often struggle with rapid-motion obstacles due to an insufficient understanding of environmental changes. To address this limitation, we propose integrating motion planners with Doppler LiDARs which provide not only ranging measurements but also instantaneous point velocities. However, this integration is nontrivial due to the dual requirements of high accuracy and high frequency. To this end, we introduce Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), which tracks and reacts to rapid obstacles using Doppler model-based learning. Particularly, we first propose a Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track the future states of obstacles under partially observable Gaussian state space model. We then leverage the estimated motions to construct a Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework for ego-motion planning, enabling runtime auto-tuning of the controller parameters. These two model-based learners allow DPNet to maintain lightweight while learning fast environmental changes using minimum data, and achieve both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning. Experiments on both high-fidelity simulator and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPNet over extensive benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: Novel iterative exchange framework for multi-UAV path planning that balances efficiency (total distance) and fairness (workload distribution) through task exchanges and collision-free trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-UAV cooperative path planning needs to address both efficiency (minimizing total mission cost) and fairness (balancing workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents), which presents a key challenge in multi-agent systems.

Method: Iterative Exchange Framework that formulates a composite objective combining total mission distance and makespan, then iteratively improves solutions via local task exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. Uses A* search over terrain-aware configuration space for collision-free trajectories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets show the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The iterative exchange framework effectively balances efficiency and fairness in multi-UAV cooperative path planning, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods through systematic task exchanges and collision-aware trajectory planning.

Abstract: Multi-UAV cooperative path planning (MUCPP) is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, aiming to generate collision-free trajectories for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to complete distributed tasks efficiently. A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search over a terrain-aware configuration space. Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic continuous control requires high energy efficiency and low latency, but conventional electronics face computational bottlenecks. Photonic computing with spiking RL offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations.

Method: Hybrid optical-electronic architecture integrating TD3 algorithm with SNN. Silicon photonic MZI chip handles linear matrix computations optically, while electronic components perform nonlinear spiking activations.

Result: Achieved 5831 reward on HalfCheetah-v2, 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, <2.2% action deviation. First programmable MZI chip application to robotic control with 1.39 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120 ps latency.

Conclusion: Photonic spiking RL demonstrates promise for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems, offering superior energy efficiency and ultra-low latency compared to conventional electronic approaches.

Abstract: Robotic continuous control tasks impose stringent demands on the energy efficiency and latency of computing architectures due to their high-dimensional state spaces and real-time interaction requirements. Conventional electronic computing platforms face computational bottlenecks, whereas the fusion of photonic computing and spiking reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. Here, we propose a novel computing architecture based on photonic spiking RL, which integrates the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm with spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed architecture employs an optical-electronic hybrid computing paradigm wherein a silicon photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) chip executes linear matrix computations, while nonlinear spiking activations are performed in the electronic domain. Experimental validation on the Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v2 benchmarks demonstrates the system capability for software-hardware co-inference, achieving a control policy reward of 5831 on HalfCheetah-v2, a 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, and an action deviation below 2.2%. Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems.

### [333] [Sample-Efficient Expert Query Control in Active Imitation Learning via Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00453)
*Arad Firouzkouhi,Omid Mirzaeedodangeh,Lars Lindemann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRSAIL reduces expert query costs in active imitation learning by only requesting labels for novel states, using conformal prediction to set query thresholds, achieving expert-level performance with 96% fewer queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert action labeling is expensive in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit similar states. Current active imitation learning methods incur high costs by querying too frequently.

Method: CRSAIL scores state novelty using distance to K-th nearest expert state, sets global query threshold via conformal prediction (empirical (1-α) quantile of on-policy calibration scores), enabling full trajectory rollouts with post-episode expert queries only for novel states.

Result: On MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches/exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with robustness to α and K parameters.

Conclusion: CRSAIL provides a distribution-free, task-agnostic querying strategy that dramatically reduces expert labeling costs while maintaining performance, making active imitation learning more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Active imitation learning (AIL) combats covariate shift by querying an expert during training. However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-α)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $α$ to the expected query rate and makes $α$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $α$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAP is a latent space planning framework for autonomous driving that uses VAE-learned disentangled representations to capture multi-modal driving strategies with single-step inference, achieving SOTA performance with 10x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for driving behavior modeling have two key limitations: (1) iterative sampling causes substantial latency, and (2) operating on raw trajectory points forces models to focus on low-level kinematics rather than high-level multi-modal semantics.

Method: Proposes LAtent Planner (LAP) that plans in a VAE-learned latent space that disentangles high-level intents from low-level kinematics. Introduces fine-grained feature distillation to guide better interaction between semantic planning space and vectorized scene context. Can produce plans in single denoising step.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on nuPlan benchmark among learning-based planning methods, with inference speed-up of up to 10x over previous SOTA approaches.

Conclusion: LAP effectively addresses latency and semantic modeling limitations of diffusion-based planners by operating in disentangled latent space, enabling efficient high-quality planning with rich multi-modal strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities for modeling human-like driving behaviors in autonomous driving, but their iterative sampling process induces substantial latency, and operating directly on raw trajectory points forces the model to spend capacity on low-level kinematics, rather than high-level multi-modal semantics. To address these limitations, we propose LAtent Planner (LAP), a framework that plans in a VAE-learned latent space that disentangles high-level intents from low-level kinematics, enabling our planner to capture rich, multi-modal driving strategies. We further introduce a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism to guide a better interaction and fusion between the high-level semantic planning space and the vectorized scene context. Notably, LAP can produce high-quality plans in one single denoising step, substantially reducing computational overhead. Through extensive evaluations on the large-scale nuPlan benchmark, LAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance among learning-based planning methods, while demonstrating an inference speed-up of at most 10 times over previous SOTA approaches.

TL;DR: Hierarchical navigation framework using Deep Transformer Q-Network for subgoal selection with visibility-aware candidate generation and low-level controller, enabling safe navigation in occluded environments across 2D/3D domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation in partially observable environments requires reasoning beyond immediate sensor input, handling occlusions, and ensuring safety. Classical planning and memoryless RL fail under limited FoVs and occlusions, leading to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers.

Method: Hierarchical framework with Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as high-level subgoal selector consuming short histories of task-aware features (odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, visibility cues). Visibility-aware candidate generation with masking/exposure penalties rewards cover usage and anticipatory safety. Low-level potential field controller tracks selected subgoals for short-horizon obstacle avoidance.

Result: Consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal. Ablations confirm value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. Framework transfers from 2D simulation to 3D Unity-ROS environment without architectural changes.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides generalizable solution for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms in urban driving, warehouse automation, defense, and surveillance applications.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in partially observable environments requires agents to reason beyond immediate sensor input, exploit occlusion, and ensure safety while progressing toward a goal. These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. These findings highlight a generalizable framework for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms.

TL;DR: TBV-PASI: A correspondence-free method for aligning rotation sets on SO(3) by decomposing rotations into transformed basis vectors on S², using robust spherical matchers with permutation-and-sign invariant wrapper to handle axis relabeling, achieving linear complexity and high robustness to outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning rotation sets on SO(3) is fundamental for calibration and registration tasks, but existing methods struggle with missing time alignment, outliers, unknown axis conventions, and high computational complexity.

Method: Decompose rotations into Transformed Basis Vectors (TBVs) - three unit vectors on S². Align resulting spherical point sets per axis using robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, hybrid). Handle axis relabels and sign flips with Permutation-and-Sign Invariant (PASI) wrapper that enumerates 24 proper signed permutations, scores via summed correlations, and fuses per-axis estimates via projection/Karcher mean.

Result: Method achieves accurate alignment, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90%), all without correspondence search. Validated on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations (axis-consistent) and ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (axis-ambiguous).

Conclusion: TBV-PASI provides an efficient, robust solution for correspondence-free rotation set alignment with linear complexity, addressing key challenges of axis ambiguity and outliers while significantly outperforming traditional methods in speed and robustness.

Abstract: We address the correspondence-free alignment of two rotation sets on \(SO(3)\), a core task in calibration and registration that is often impeded by missing time alignment, outliers, and unknown axis conventions. Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \(S^2\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean. The overall complexity remains linear in the number of rotations (\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)), contrasting with \(\mathcal{O}(N_r^3\log N_r)\) for spherical/\(SO(3)\) correlation. Experiments on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations
  (axis-consistent) and the ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (\texttt{robot\_arm\_real})
  (axis-ambiguous) show that our methods are accurate, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, and robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90\%), all without correspondence search.

Conclusion: Embedding both kinematic structure and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a powerful inductive bias for legged robot locomotion control, demonstrating the effectiveness of symmetry-equivariant architectures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently enabled impressive locomotion capabilities on legged robots; however, most policy architectures remain morphology- and symmetry-agnostic, leading to inefficient training and limited generalization. This work introduces MS-PPO, a morphological-symmetry-equivariant policy learning framework that encodes robot kinematic structure and morphological symmetries directly into the policy network. We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry. We evaluate MS-PPO in simulation on Unitree Go2 and Xiaomi CyberDog2 robots across diverse locomotion tasks, including trotting, pronking, slope walking, and bipedal turning, and further deploy the learned policies on hardware. Extensive experiments show that MS-PPO achieves superior training stability, symmetry generalization ability, and sample efficiency in challenging locomotion tasks, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These findings demonstrate that embedding both kinematic structure and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a powerful inductive bias for legged robot locomotion control.

Result: Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains show SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.

Conclusion: SAGAS provides a novel solution for LTL-constrained control in challenging offline, model-free settings, demonstrating the feasibility of combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning to handle complex robotic tasks using only fragmented trajectory datasets.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) provides a rigorous framework for complex robotic tasks, yet existing methods often rely on accurate dynamics models or expensive online interactions. In this work, we address LTL-constrained control in a challenging offline, model-free setting, utilizing only fixed, task-agnostic datasets of fragmented trajectories. We propose SAGAS, a novel framework combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning. First, we construct a latent reachability graph from a learned temporal-distance representation. To bridge the semantic gap, we augment this graph with certified anchor nodes and probabilistic soft labels. We then translate the specification into a Büchi automaton and search the implicit product space to derive a cost-minimal prefix-suffix plan. Finally, a subgoal-conditioned low-level policy is deployed to execute these latent waypoints. Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains demonstrate that SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.

*Nitin Kumar Singh,Arie Rachmad Syulistyo,Yuichiro Tanaka,Hakaru Tamukoh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient sign language recognition system using MediaPipe for hand joint extraction and echo state network-based bidirectional reservoir computing for temporal processing, achieving competitive accuracy with dramatically reduced training time suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based sign language recognition systems are computationally intensive and require substantial resources, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. There's a need for efficient SLR systems that can operate on limited hardware.

Method: Uses MediaPipe to extract hand joint coordinates from sign language videos, then processes these features through an echo state network-based bidirectional reservoir computing architecture that captures temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The resulting states are concatenated for classification.

Result: Achieved 57.71% accuracy on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset with only 9 seconds of training time, compared to 55 minutes and 38 seconds for deep learning-based Bi-GRU approach, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The proposed BRC-based SLR system is computationally efficient, achieves competitive accuracy, and is well-suited for deployment on edge devices due to its low training time and resource requirements.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing individuals. Deep learning is widely used to develop SLR-based systems; however, it is computationally intensive and requires substantial computational resources, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose an efficient sign language recognition system using MediaPipe and an echo state network (ESN)-based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. MediaPipe extracts hand joint coordinates, which serve as inputs to the ESN-based BRC architecture. The BRC processes these features in both forward and backward directions, efficiently capturing temporal dependencies. The resulting states of BRC are concatenated to form a robust representation for classification. We evaluated our method on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving a competitive accuracy of 57.71% and a significantly lower training time of only 9 seconds, in contrast to the 55 minutes and $38$ seconds required by the deep learning-based Bi-GRU approach. Consequently, the BRC-based SLR system is well-suited for edge devices.

*Nan Sun,Bo Mao,Yongchang Li,Chenxu Wang,Di Guo,Huaping Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: InteractGen is an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for perception, planning, verification, and human delegation, showing better performance than monolithic foundation models for service robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for robotics have limitations: vision-language models lack embodiment-aware actions, vision-language-action policies are brittle across embodiments and weak in geometric grounding, and monolithic models can't handle the distributed, dynamic nature of real-world service workflows. Scaling single models alone can't deliver reliable autonomy for service robots in human-populated settings.

Method: InteractGen uses an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation. It treats foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective system.

Result: Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration compared to monolithic approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone foundation models, as demonstrated by InteractGen's success in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Foundation models have become central to unifying perception and planning in robotics, yet real-world deployment exposes a mismatch between their monolithic assumption that a single model can handle all cognitive functions and the distributed, dynamic nature of practical service workflows. Vision-language models offer strong semantic understanding but lack embodiment-aware action capabilities while relying on hand-crafted skills. Vision-Language-Action policies enable reactive manipulation but remain brittle across embodiments, weak in geometric grounding, and devoid of proactive collaboration mechanisms. These limitations indicate that scaling a single model alone cannot deliver reliable autonomy for service robots operating in human-populated settings. To address this gap, we present InteractGen, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation, treating foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective. Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration, providing evidence that multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone models.

TL;DR: A scalable framework decomposes large MDPs for UAV mission management using factor-based partitioning and priority-based recombination with provable optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes for UAV mission management in complex, uncertain environments.

Method: Two-stage decomposition: 1) Factor-based algorithm partitions global MDP into goal-specific sub-MDPs using domain features, 2) Priority-based recombination solves sub-MDPs independently and integrates results with meta-policy for conflict resolution.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows combined policy is provably equivalent to optimal global MDP policy under mild assumptions; simulations show orders-of-magnitude computation time reduction without sacrificing reliability or optimality.

Conclusion: Framework advances AI decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence, establishing practical foundation for real-time UAV mission execution.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.

*Chengjin Du,Federico Bernabei,Zhengyin Du,Sergio Decherchi,Matteo Lo Preti,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoftMag actuator integrates magnetic tactile sensing into soft robotics, uses neural networks to correct signal distortion from actuator deformations, and enables real-time force sensing and object firmness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots lack integrated tactile sensing, and existing sensor signals are distorted by actuator deformations, hindering adoption for delicate object manipulation.

Method: Developed SoftMag actuator with integrated magnetic tactile sensing, used multiphysics simulation to model actuator-sensor coupling, implemented neural-network-based decoupling to remove parasitic signals, and extended to a two-finger gripper with multi-task neural network for real-time force/position prediction.

Result: Validated performance through indentation, actuation, and fatigue tests. Gripper achieved strong correlation (Pearson r > 0.8) between estimated firmness and reference measurements on apricots, enabling non-destructive quality assessment.

Conclusion: Integrated magnetic sensing with learning-based correction enables soft robotic platforms that adapt grasps and quantify material properties, advancing sensorized soft actuators toward intelligent, material-aware robotics.

Abstract: Soft robots are powerful tools for manipulating delicate objects, yet their adoption is hindered by two gaps: the lack of integrated tactile sensing and sensor signal distortion caused by actuator deformations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the SoftMag actuator: a magnetic tactile-sensorized soft actuator. Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties. The framework offers an approach for advancing sensorized soft actuators toward intelligent, material-aware robotics.

TL;DR: B-CTMP extends constant-time motion planning to manipulation tasks by precomputing data structures for two-step behaviors (approach + manipulation), guaranteeing millisecond queries with provable success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deployed robotic systems are limited to simple routines due to lack of motion planning algorithms with verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency, and reliability. While CTMP enables fast collision-free queries, it doesn't incorporate essential manipulation behaviors needed for object handling.

Method: Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner (B-CTMP) extends CTMP to solve two-step manipulation tasks: (1) collision-free motion to behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of manipulation behavior (grasping, insertion). Uses precomputed compact data structures to guarantee constant-time queries in milliseconds while ensuring completeness.

Result: Evaluated on shelf picking and plug insertion tasks in simulation and on real robot. B-CTMP successfully unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success.

Conclusion: B-CTMP bridges the gap between fast motion planning and manipulation behaviors, enabling reliable manipulation in semi-structured environments with guaranteed performance and success rates.

Abstract: Recent progress in contact-rich robotic manipulation has been striking, yet most deployed systems remain confined to simple, scripted routines. One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments.

Conclusion: Pretraining on limited embodiments enables effective zero-shot and few-shot transfer to novel humanoid robots, addressing the challenge of robot-specific controller development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics has intensified the need for robust and adaptable controllers to enable stable and efficient locomotion across diverse platforms.

Conclusion: FOM-Nav effectively addresses Object Goal Navigation challenges by combining frontier-based exploration with semantic understanding through vision-language models, demonstrating superior performance in both simulation benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Object Goal Navigation problem, where a robot must efficiently find a target object in an unknown environment.

*Adelina Giurea,Stijn Luchie,Dieter Coppens,Jeroen Hoebeke,Eli De Poorter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UWB radar on mobile robots enables obstacle detection and mapping in vision-impaired environments without fixed infrastructure, achieving over 82% precision and 89% recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensors like cameras and LiDAR fail in poor visibility conditions (darkness, smoke, reflective surfaces), creating a need for alternative sensing modalities that work in vision-impaired environments without relying on fixed anchor nodes.

Method: Robot-mounted UWB radar system with analysis of material effects (metal, concrete, plywood) and radio channels (5 and 9). Three-step processing pipeline: target identification via CIR peak detection, filtering based on peak properties/SNR/phase-difference, and clustering using distance and angle-of-arrival estimation.

Result: Successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, achieving obstacle detection precision ≥82.36% and recall of 89.46% on channel 9, even for low-reflective materials like plywood.

Conclusion: UWB radar provides a viable infrastructure-free alternative for environmental mapping in challenging conditions, laying foundation for future UWB-based SLAM systems that don't rely on visual features or fixed anchor nodes.

Abstract: This paper presents an infrastructure-free approach for obstacle detection and environmental mapping using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CycleManip framework enables robots to perform cyclic/repetitive tasks with expected terminal timing through enhanced history perception and multi-task learning, plus a new benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cycle-based manipulation tasks (like shaking bottles or knocking nails) are important in daily life but underexplored, with challenges in completing tasks within expected terminal time and lack of benchmarks.

Method: CycleManip framework uses cost-aware sampling strategy for effective history perception and multi-task learning for historical understanding, working end-to-end without extra models or hierarchical structures.

Result: Achieves high success rates in cycle-based tasks, shows strong adaptability in general manipulation, plug-and-play compatibility with VLA models, and works across diverse robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Proposes effective solution for cycle-based manipulation with both framework and benchmark, demonstrating practical applicability across various robot platforms and tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet underexplored task in robot manipulation: cycle-based manipulation, where robots need to perform cyclic or repetitive actions with an expected terminal time. These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLASH is an asynchronous inference framework for Vision-Language-Action models that enables smooth, continuous robot control by bridging temporal misalignment between prediction and execution without accuracy loss or overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs suffer from slow real-world deployment with sped-up demonstration videos, action stalls, and delayed reactions. Asynchronous inference could help but creates temporal misalignment between prediction and execution intervals, causing action instability.

Method: VLASH estimates future execution-time states by rolling the robot state forward with previously generated action chunks, bridging the gap between prediction and execution without architectural changes or additional overhead.

Result: Achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while preserving original accuracy. Enables VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks like ping-pong and whack-a-mole.

Conclusion: VLASH provides a general asynchronous inference framework that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control for VLAs, overcoming limitations of synchronous inference for real-world robotic deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

The robot is capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigation, object detection, and grasping using GraspNet. Testing was conducted through real-world scenarios to evaluate navigation, object selection and grasping, and user experience. The results show that the robot can perform tasks accurately and consistently, achieving a grasping success rate of 75 % from 12 trials. Therefore, the system demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the capabilities of quadruped robots as service robots in real-world environments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates that GPU-accelerated simulation combined with novel training strategies can produce vision-based humanoid policies that transfer robustly to real-world articulated loco-manipulation tasks without real-world training data.

Abstract: Recent progress in GPU-accelerated, photorealistic simulation has opened a scalable data-generation path for robot learning, where massive physics and visual randomization allow policies to generalize beyond curated environments. Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack. This represents the first humanoid sim-to-real policy capable of diverse articulated loco-manipulation using pure RGB perception.

The contributions of the paper include neural network models that allow us to quantify the accuracy of predicting the vehicle speed and yaw, as well as the presence of a lead vehicle, and its relative distance and speed. In addition, the paper describes how other researchers can gather their own data to perform similar experiments, using open-source tools and off-the-shelf technology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: College students struggle with academic productivity, but existing solutions (self-help books, productivity apps, traditional coaching) have limitations: books are non-interactive, apps lack educational focus, and coaching is resource-intensive and hard to scale.

Method: Developed a socially assistive robot (SAR) that delivers six lessons on time management and task prioritization via chat interface with speech responses. Includes integrated dashboard for progress monitoring, mood tracking, engagement, confidence, and personalized productivity insights.

Result: Evaluation with 15 college students showed System Usability Score of 79.2, with high ratings for overall experience and engagement.

Conclusion: SAR-based productivity coaching offers an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: College students often face academic challenges that hamper their productivity and well-being. Although self-help books and productivity apps are popular, they often fall short. Books provide generalized, non-interactive guidance, and apps are not inherently educational and can hinder the development of key organizational skills. Traditional productivity coaching offers personalized support, but is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept for a socially assistive robot (SAR) as an educational coach and a potential solution to the limitations of existing productivity tools and coaching approaches. The SAR delivers six different lessons on time management and task prioritization. Users interact via a chat interface, while the SAR responds through speech (with a toggle option). An integrated dashboard monitors progress, mood, engagement, confidence per lesson, and time spent per lesson. It also offers personalized productivity insights to foster reflection and self-awareness. We evaluated the system with 15 college students, achieving a System Usability Score of 79.2 and high ratings for overall experience and engagement. Our findings suggest that SAR-based productivity coaching can offer an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students.

*Gabriel Olin,Lu Chen,Nayesha Gandotra,Maxim Likhachev,Howie Choset*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-time interception of fast-moving objects using a robot arm with noisy sensors by growing a tree structure in state-time space that enables reachability to multiple goals and seamless goal switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intercepting fast-moving objects is challenging due to tight time constraints, especially with sensor noise that provides incomplete information and results in distribution over target states. The planner must begin directing the interceptor while still receiving information.

Method: Introduce a tree-like structure grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space that encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, enabling real-time value updates as target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals. Use RIAE-AKF (Robust Innovation-based Adaptive Estimation Adaptive Kalman Filter) for target tracking and belief updates.

Result: Evaluated on interception task with 6 DOF industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) with onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i), demonstrating real-time interception capability.

Conclusion: The proposed tree-based framework enables real-time interception of fast-moving objects under sensor noise by maintaining reachability to multiple goals and adapting to evolving target beliefs.

Abstract: Intercepting fast moving objects, by its very nature, is challenging because of its tight time constraints. This problem becomes further complicated in the presence of sensor noise because noisy sensors provide, at best, incomplete information, which results in a distribution over target states to be intercepted. Since time is of the essence, to hit the target, the planner must begin directing the interceptor, in this case a robot arm, while still receiving information. We introduce an tree-like structure, which is grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. This tree-like structure encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, while enabling real-time value updates as the target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals. We evaluate our framework on an interception task on a 6 DOF industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) with an onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i). A robust Innovation-based Adaptive Estimation Adaptive Kalman Filter (RIAE-AKF) is used to track the target and perform belief updates.

TL;DR: AAWR is a robot learning method that trains active perception policies by leveraging privileged sensors during training to estimate advantages, enabling efficient learning of information-gathering behaviors under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard robot learning techniques struggle with active perception behaviors needed when sensory observations don't reveal task-relevant state information. Robots need to explicitly act to gain missing information under partial observability.

Method: Asymmetric Advantage Weighted Regression (AAWR) uses privileged extra sensors at training time to train high-quality privileged value functions that estimate the advantage of the target policy. It bootstraps from a small number of demonstrations and coarse policy initialization.

Result: AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches across 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots with varying degrees of partial observability. It enables operation under severe partial observability when initialized with generalist policies.

Conclusion: AAWR provides an effective recipe for training active perception policies in real-world robots by exploiting privileged sensor access during training, addressing a key limitation of current robot learning methods in partial observability scenarios.

Abstract: A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swarm-based target tracking offers advantages over single-drone systems (distributed perception, fault tolerance, multidirectional coverage) but remains underexplored, especially for complex environments requiring visibility awareness.

Method: Proposes SSDF-based occlusion representation, FOV alignment for heterogeneous LiDARs, electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric for 3D encirclement, and hierarchical planner with kinodynamic front-end and SE(3) back-end optimizer.

Result: Validated through real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, demonstrating robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) with superior visibility maintenance.

Conclusion: The framework enables fully decentralized, visibility-aware cooperative target tracking that harnesses swarm capabilities for complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial tracking with drones offers vast potential for surveillance, cinematography, and industrial inspection applications. While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability. Validated through rigorous real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, the proposed system demonstrates robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) while achieving superior visibility maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots are prone to falls due to their morphology, dynamics, and control limitations, which can cause serious hardware damage to themselves and surroundings. Existing control-based methods struggle with diverse falling scenarios and may impose unsuitable human priors.

Method: Used large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum to train humanoid agents to discover falling protection behaviors that fit their own nature and properties.

Result: Discovered that forming a 'triangle' structure significantly reduces falling damage with rigid-material bodies. Quantified performance with comprehensive metrics, visualized falling behaviors, and successfully transferred the policy to real-world platforms.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning with curriculum learning enables humanoid robots to autonomously discover effective falling protection strategies that are tailored to their physical properties, outperforming traditional control-based methods and enabling safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have received significant research interests and advancements in recent years. Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots. And its large weight, tall Center of Mass, high Degree-of-Freedom would cause serious hardware damages when falling uncontrolled, to both itself and surrounding objects. Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform.

TL;DR: Modality-augmented fine-tuning framework adapts foundation robot policies to different humanoid embodiments, improving success rates through contact signals, depth data, and multi-modal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable foundation robot policies to work effectively across diverse humanoid embodiments by addressing the challenge of adapting general policies to specific robot platforms with different physical characteristics and capabilities.

Method: A modality-augmented fine-tuning framework that introduces post-processed modalities (binary contact signals, ZoeDepth-generated metric depth) for GR1, and creates a novel multi-modal dataset for Unitree G1 with cuRobo motion planning, inverse kinematics, and ground-truth contact-force measurements.

Result: For GR1: Success rate improved from 51% to 63% with contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion. For G1 "Pick Apple to Bowl" task: Contact-augmented model achieved 94% success vs 48% with standard fine-tuning and 0% zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: Lightweight post-processing strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to Unitree G1. Establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper presents a modality-augmented fine-tuning framework designed to adapt foundation robot policies to diverse humanoid embodiments. We validate our approach across two distinct settings: (i) the GR1 embodiment, utilizing public datasets where we introduce post-processed modalities, including binary contact signals and ZoeDepth-generated metric depth; and (ii) the Unitree G1 embodiment, for which we contribute a novel multi-modal dataset incorporating cuRobo motion planning, inverse kinematics, and ground-truth contact-force measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 "Pick Apple to Bowl" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1. Consequently, this work establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning.

TL;DR: M³A framework uses computational photography to photometrically re-render single real-world demonstrations with different material properties, enabling robotic policies to generalize across diverse materials without additional data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with material generalization, especially for transparent/reflective surfaces like glass and metal. Existing approaches either rely on simulation (suffering from visual domain gaps) or require extensive real-world data collection (costly and insufficient).

Method: Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M³A) leverages computational photography and light transport physics to photometrically re-render single real-world demonstrations, generating diverse realistic demonstrations with different material properties.

Result: M³A improves average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03%, demonstrates robust performance on unseen materials, and enables creation of the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark.

Conclusion: Photometric re-rendering effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling material generalization without costly data collection, representing a significant advancement for real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Material generalization is essential for real-world robotic manipulation, where robots must interact with objects exhibiting diverse visual and physical properties. This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied navigation agents struggle with long-term planning in unseen environments, leading to high failure rates when following complex natural language instructions.

Method: NavForesee unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination in a single VLM framework. It decomposes tasks, tracks progress, formulates sub-goals while also predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones.

Result: NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in complex navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: Fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction creates a powerful internal feedback loop, paving the way for more intelligent embodied agents.

Abstract: Embodied navigation for long-horizon tasks, guided by complex natural language instructions, remains a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents.

TL;DR: L2M-Calib: A novel one-key calibration framework for fused magnetic-LiDAR systems that jointly estimates extrinsic transformations and intrinsic distortion parameters, enabling robust multimodal sensor fusion in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field patterns that are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them ideal for challenging environments. However, effective calibration techniques for integrating magnetic sensing into multimodal systems are lacking, preventing their wider adoption despite their complementary benefits with LiDAR.

Method: Proposes L2M-Calib framework that uses iterative Gauss-Newton optimization for extrinsic parameters and formulates intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem to handle measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. The method jointly estimates extrinsic transformations between magnetic and LiDAR sensors along with magnetic sensor intrinsic distortion parameters.

Result: Extensive evaluations on simulated datasets and real-world experiments (including AGV-mounted sensor configurations) demonstrate high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions.

Conclusion: L2M-Calib provides an effective solution for calibrating magnetic-LiDAR fusion systems, enabling robust multimodal perception in challenging environments where traditional sensors may fail, and addresses the previously underexplored integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion enables robust environmental perception by leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous sensing modalities. However, accurate calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective fusion. This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions.

TL;DR: CEGB is a new gripper benchmarking suite that extends YCB/NIST metrics to evaluate cross-embodiment transferability, energy consumption, and payload assessment for modern mobile and aerial manipulation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks (YCB, NIST) only measure grasp success, force, or timing on single platforms, but don't evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance needed for modern mobile and aerial manipulation systems.

Method: CEGB extends YCB and selected NIST metrics with three new components: 1) transfer-time benchmark measuring effort to exchange embodiments, 2) energy-consumption benchmark for grasping/holding efficiency, and 3) intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent capability.

Result: Experiments show rapid embodiment transfer (median ~17.6s), low holding energy (~1.5J per 10s), consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2-3.9s and success rates >90% using a self-locking gripper prototype.

Conclusion: CEGB provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulator domains, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks for modern robotic applications.

Abstract: Robotic grippers are increasingly deployed across industrial, collaborative, and aerial platforms, where each embodiment imposes distinct mechanical, energetic, and operational constraints. Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%. CEGB thus provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulators domains.

Conclusion: The integrated perception-control framework provides provably stable autonomous navigation for differential-drive robots using only onboard vision, eliminating need for HD maps or global localization.

Abstract: This work presents a real-time autonomous track navigation framework for nonholonomic differential-drive mobile robots by jointly integrating multi-task visual perception and a provably stable tracking controller. The perception pipeline reconstructs lane centerlines using 2D-to-3D camera projection, arc-length based uniform point resampling, and cubic polynomial fitting solved via robust QR least-squares optimization. The controller regulates robot linear and angular velocities through a Lyapunov-stability grounded design, ensuring bounded error dynamics and asymptotic convergence of position and heading deviations even in dynamic and partially perceived lane scenarios, without relying on HD prior maps or global satellite localization. Real-world experiments on embedded platforms verify system fidelity, real-time execution, trajectory smoothness, and closed-loop stability for reliable autonomous navigation.

*Xin Yin,Chenyang Liang,Yanning Guo,Jie Mei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes DLGP-CBF, a Gaussian Process-based Control Barrier Function that enables real-time construction of spatially informative and obstacle motion-aware safety constraints for dynamic navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBF methods struggle with online synthesis of informative and obstacle motion-aware safety constraints using real-time sensor data, especially in unknown and dynamic environments.

Method: Uses logarithmic transformation of Gaussian Process regression to generate smooth barrier values/gradients, and explicitly models CBF as function of obstacle positions to incorporate predicted obstacle velocities.

Result: Simulation shows significant improvements: increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness to dynamic obstacles compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DLGP-CBF successfully enables real-time construction of spatially informative and motion-responsive safety constraints for improved obstacle avoidance in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.

*Wanpeng Zhang,Ye Wang,Hao Luo,Haoqi Yuan,Yicheng Feng,Sipeng Zheng,Qin Jin,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiG-Flow enhances Vision-Language-Action models with geometric regularization using distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings to improve robustness on complex tasks and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models trained with flow matching degrade under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting learned representations don't robustly capture task-relevant semantics.

Method: Computes discrepancy between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via monotone function, and applies residual updates to observation embeddings before flow matching without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees showing discrepancy-guided training decreases training objective and guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, especially on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.

Conclusion: DiG-Flow offers a principled geometric regularization framework that enhances VLA robustness by leveraging distributional discrepancy signals, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements across challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets needed for research on robust SLAM operations in challenging outdoor agricultural environments.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset spanning three farmland types (flat, hilly, terraced) with two operation modes, providing synchronized measurements from 3D LiDAR, 4D Radar, IMU, and high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from FINS_RTK system.

Result: AgriLiRa4D dataset enables diverse SLAM and localization studies, supports robustness evaluation against agricultural challenges, and benchmarking shows the difficulty of sequences and necessity of multi-modal approaches.

Conclusion: AgriLiRa4D fills a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, provides a valuable benchmark for research, and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

Abstract: Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IGen generates realistic robot training data from open-world images by converting 2D pixels to 3D scenes, using VLMs for task planning, and synthesizing SE(3) pose sequences with coherent visual observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robotic policies need massive training data, but on-robot collection is expensive and limited. Open-world images offer vast, diverse real-world scenes aligned with manipulation tasks, but lack associated robot actions, making them unusable for training.

Method: IGen converts 2D pixels to structured 3D scene representations, uses vision-language models to transform task instructions into high-level plans, generates low-level SE(3) end-effector pose sequences, and synthesizes dynamic scene evolution with temporally coherent visual observations.

Result: IGen produces high-quality visuomotor data, and policies trained solely on this synthetic data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data.

Conclusion: IGen enables scalable robot data generation from open-world images, potentially supporting large-scale training of generalist robotic policies without expensive real-world data collection.

Abstract: The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GR-RL is a robotic learning framework that transforms generalist vision-language-action policies into specialized experts for long-horizon dexterous manipulation by filtering, augmenting, and reinforcing human demonstrations through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA policies assume human demonstrations are optimal, but in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are often noisy and suboptimal. There's a need to improve upon human demonstrations for tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction.

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline: 1) Learn vision-language-conditioned task progress, filter demonstrations using Q-values from offline RL with sparse reward as progress function, 2) Apply morphological symmetry augmentation for generalization, 3) Perform online RL by learning latent space noise predictor to align policy with deployment behaviors.

Result: GR-RL achieves 83.3% success rate on autonomously lacing up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets - the first learning-based policy to accomplish this complex task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and soft-body interaction.

Conclusion: GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts by addressing the limitations of human demonstrations in dexterous manipulation through a systematic filtering, augmentation, and reinforcement pipeline.

Abstract: We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Generative control policies' success comes from iterative computation with supervised intermediate steps and appropriate stochasticity, not from multi-modality or complex mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why generative models (flows, diffusions) work well as robotic control policies, testing common assumptions about multi-modality and complex behavior expression.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of generative control policies on behavior cloning benchmarks, comparing to a minimum iterative policy (MIP) - a lightweight two-step regression-based approach.

Result: GCPs don't succeed due to multi-modality or complex mappings; advantage comes from iterative computation with supervised intermediate training steps and suitable stochasticity. MIP matches flow GCP performance and often beats distilled shortcut models.

Conclusion: Distribution-fitting aspect of GCPs is less important than believed; focus should shift to control performance design spaces using iterative computation principles.

Abstract: Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand accuracy of single RGB image-based 6-DoF object pose estimators and assess their viability as the only perception system for robotic grasping tasks.

Method: Developed evaluation framework using physics-based simulator, tested five open-source pose estimators on BOP dataset subset, performed grasping trials with parallel gripper and underactuated hand using pose estimates.

Result: Comparative experiments on BOP dataset provided new insights about pose estimators' performance that were previously missing from literature.

Conclusion: The framework successfully evaluates 6-DoF pose estimators for robotic grasping, revealing important performance characteristics and their practical limitations for real-world grasping applications.

Abstract: We present a framework for evaluating 6-DoF instance-level object pose estimators, focusing on those that require a single RGB (not RGB-D) image as input. Besides gaining intuition about how accurate these estimators are, we are interested in the degree to which they can serve as the sole perception mechanism for robotic grasping. To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand in picking up 3D models of objects. Our experiments on a subset of the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) dataset compare five open-source object pose estimators and provide insights that were missing from the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability provides formal safety guarantees for autonomous ground vehicles but suffers from poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles, making real-time deployment challenging.

Method: NeuroHJR leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate HJR solutions by embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, bypassing grid-based discretization for continuous state space estimation.

Result: The method achieves safety performance comparable to classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing computational cost, demonstrated through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios.

Conclusion: NeuroHJR provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics by overcoming the computational limitations of traditional HJR approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) must navigate safely in cluttered environments while accounting for complex dynamics and environmental uncertainty. Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics.

TL;DR: Novel deep active inference framework with multi-timescale world models and abstract action representations enables efficient goal-directed and exploratory behavior in uncertain robot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need both goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain environments, but most deep learning methods neglect exploration. Deep active inference can model both, but conventional approaches have limited representation capacity and high computational costs for action selection.

Method: Proposed framework with three components: 1) World model encoding environmental dynamics at slow/fast timescales, 2) Action model compressing action sequences into abstract actions via vector quantization, 3) Abstract world model predicting future slow states conditioned on abstract actions for low-cost action selection.

Result: Achieves high success rates across diverse real-world robot manipulation tasks, successfully switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, and makes action selection computationally tractable.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions/state transitions for efficient robot control in uncertain environments, balancing exploration and goal-directed behavior.

Abstract: Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.

Abstract: Robust robotic manipulation requires reliable failure detection and recovery. Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data.

Motivation: Autonomous driving policies trained via open-loop behavior cloning suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. Existing methods either require massive data (RL) or have restrictive assumptions (prior CL-SFT methods).

Method: RoaD (Rollouts as Demonstrations) generates closed-loop rollouts from the policy, incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, and uses these rollouts as additional training data for fine-tuning.

Result: On WOSAC traffic simulation benchmark, RoaD performs similar or better than prior CL-SFT method. In AlpaSim end-to-end driving simulator, it improves driving score by 41% and reduces collisions by 54%.

Conclusion: RoaD provides a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift in autonomous driving policies, enabling robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than RL and broader application than prior CL-SFT methods.

Abstract: Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.

TL;DR: LLM-based static simulation framework for reliable robot operation code generation without physical experiments or custom simulators


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven robot code generation relies on physical experiments or custom simulations, which are time-consuming and require high configuration effort. Need a more efficient approach that doesn't depend on dynamic execution environments.

Method: Proposes an LLM-based static simulation framework where LLM acts as a static simulator to interpret actions, reason over state transitions, analyze execution outcomes, and generate semantic observations of trajectory dynamics without actual code execution.

Result: Experiments on various operation tasks for UAVs and ground vehicles show high accuracy of static text-based simulation and reliable code generation comparable to state-of-the-art methods, without needing physical experiments or simulators.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as static simulators for robot operation code, enabling reliable corrective code generation without the overhead of physical experiments or custom simulation environments, making LLM-driven robots more deployable.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their promising capabilities of generating robot operation code to enable LLM-driven robots. To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer approaches are limited by difficulties in simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, particularly tactile feedback, which is crucial for dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Train RL policies in simulation using simplified object models to develop correct finger gaits, 2) Use learned policy as skill primitive in teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations with tactile and proprioceptive data, 3) Train behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing for generalization.

Result: High task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer, with robust performance on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations for both nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving tasks.

Conclusion: DexScrew effectively addresses sim-to-real limitations for dexterous manipulation by combining simulation-based RL with real-world tactile demonstrations, enabling generalization to diverse object geometries and robust performance in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer have made significant progress in dexterous manipulation. However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

TL;DR: ManualVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that uses multimodal manual generation and Manual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve robotic performance on long-horizon tasks like LEGO assembly and object rearrangement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with long-horizon tasks requiring defined goal states, as they lack the ability to coordinate high-level planning with precise manipulation. The goal is to enable VLA models to infer executable procedures from goal states.

Method: ManualVLA uses a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture with two experts: 1) a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals (images, position prompts, textual instructions), and 2) an action expert that uses Manual Chain-of-Thought reasoning, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions and implicit guidance. A 3D Gaussian Splatting digital-twin toolkit generates training data.

Result: ManualVLA achieves an average success rate 32% higher than previous hierarchical state-of-the-art baselines on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks, demonstrating strong real-world performance.

Conclusion: ManualVLA successfully enables VLA models to transform goal states into executable procedures through multimodal manual generation and reasoning, addressing the challenge of coordinating planning with manipulation in long-horizon robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EfficientFlow is a flow-based policy learning framework that improves data efficiency through equivariant flow matching and accelerates inference via novel acceleration regularization, achieving competitive performance with limited data and faster sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative policies for visuomotor control suffer from two key inefficiencies: data inefficiency (requiring large-scale demonstrations) and sampling inefficiency (slow action generation during inference). The authors aim to address both limitations simultaneously.

Method: EfficientFlow introduces two key innovations: 1) Equivariant flow matching that uses isotropic Gaussian prior and equivariant velocity prediction network to maintain equivariant action distributions, improving generalization and data efficiency. 2) Acceleration regularization with a novel surrogate loss that enables stable training using only conditional trajectories to accelerate sampling.

Result: Across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks, EfficientFlow achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EfficientFlow presents a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI that addresses both data and sampling inefficiencies in generative policy learning through theoretically grounded equivariant flow matching and practical acceleration techniques.

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.
