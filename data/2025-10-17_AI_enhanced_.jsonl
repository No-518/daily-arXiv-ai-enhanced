Our approach conditions on\nboth temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent\ncontent for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal\nboundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve\ndynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene\nmemory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the\nentire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our\nnewly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static\nscene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then\nbe projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped\nviews that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to\nevolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain\nlong-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing\ncomputational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene\nconsistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.
