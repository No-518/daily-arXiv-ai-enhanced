*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to improve 3D lunar maps from Kaguya TC images by reducing compression-induced noise in disparity maps, enhancing data quality for long-distance lunar missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D lunar maps are critical for long-distance missions like NASA's Endurance rover mission, but Kaguya TC images suffer from altitude inaccuracies due to stereo matching errors and JPEG compression artifacts.

Method: The approach analyzes compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, identifies systematic disparity noise patterns (especially in darker regions), and reduces residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed images.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise in 3D lunar maps.

Conclusion: The method enhances the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions by improving 3D map quality.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's advantage over DINO in vision-language models comes from language supervision enabling better semantic understanding, not just larger training data, with CLIP excelling at text-intensive tasks while DINO performs slightly better on vision-centric ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether CLIP's superior performance as vision encoders in vision-language models stems from language supervision or larger training data, and to disentangle these factors through controlled experiments.

Method: Pre-trained CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with same architecture, dataset, and training configuration to achieve similar ImageNet accuracy, then analyzed embeddings and integrated them into VLMs for evaluation on 20 VQA benchmarks.

Result: CLIP captures high-level semantics (object categories, text) while DINO responds more to low-level features (colors, styles). CLIP excels at text-intensive VQA tasks, DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric tasks. Language supervision variants showed limited gains.

Conclusion: Language supervision in CLIP enables better semantic understanding crucial for vision-language tasks, providing scientific insights for vision encoder design in VLMs.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net is a novel model that uses CNN and Thin Plate Spline transformation to estimate 3D room layouts from single panorama images, achieving high accuracy on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D room layout estimation is crucial for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design, but existing methods may struggle with both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) CNN extracts features and learns TPS transformation parameters, 2) TPS layer warps reference layout to predicted layout using learned parameters.

Result: Achieved 3DIoU values of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets respectively, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed PanoTPS-Net effectively combines CNN with TPS transformation for accurate room layout estimation from panoramas, showing strong generalization to both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatial reasoning framework that embeds bounding box coordinates into prompts to improve spatial understanding in warehouse environments, achieving 4th place in the AI City Challenge with a score of 73.0606.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning in cluttered warehouse environments due to reliance on local appearance and lack of explicit spatial grounding.

Method: Embed mask dimensions (bounding box coordinates) directly into input prompts, fine-tune across four question categories with task-specific supervision, and append normalized answers to GPT responses in training.

Result: Achieved a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard of the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge.

Conclusion: Structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization effectively advance spatial reasoning capabilities for real-world industrial environments.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Vision Transformer explainability methods (Grad-CAM and Gradient Attention Rollout) on medical imaging tasks, finding DINO with Grad-CAM provides the most faithful and localized explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging but their complex attention mechanisms pose interpretability challenges, which directly impacts clinical trust and adoption.

Method: Evaluated ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer architectures with Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification tasks.

Result: DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields scattered activations.

Conclusion: By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of Vision Transformers into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet is an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network for detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments, addressing image degradation and marine camouflage challenges through Siamese architecture, MSRCR data augmentation, and adaptive prior-guided mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection faces challenges from image degradation (low contrast, color distortion) and natural marine camouflage. Traditional enhancement techniques and terrestrial COD methods fail to handle underwater optical characteristics effectively.

Method: Proposes APGNet with Siamese architecture and prior-guided mechanism. Uses MSRCR algorithm for illumination-invariant data augmentation, Extended Receptive Field module with Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder for contextual information, and adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors using spatial attention and deformable convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MAS datasets show APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods across widely used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: APGNet effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges by integrating adaptive prior guidance with robust feature enhancement, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and require human intervention when handling structure-variable editing scenarios.

Method: Leverages pose and position priors to learn generalized motion representations from source videos, enabling motion-preserved generation with structural flexibility.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show superior performance over existing methods in maintaining motion consistency while allowing structural changes.

Conclusion: VidMP3 effectively addresses key challenges in motion-preserved video editing and demonstrates promising results for flexible object swapping scenarios.

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

*Aashish Dhawan,Divyanshu Mudgal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses Domain Adaptation methods to address the challenge of limited labeled data in computer vision, enabling models trained on one domain to perform well on different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and difficulty of obtaining labeled data in computer vision necessitates methods that can overcome data scarcity while maintaining performance comparable to benchmarks.

Method: The paper explores various Domain Adaptation techniques that allow models trained on one dataset (source domain) to predict effectively on data from a different but related domain (target domain).

Result: Domain Adaptation enables comparable performance to benchmark results despite limited labeled data by leveraging knowledge transfer between related domains.

Conclusion: Domain Adaptation provides a viable solution to the labeled data scarcity problem in computer vision by enabling effective knowledge transfer between different but related domains.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Conclusion: The method provides simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution for high-quality audio-driven video generation with multi-character support.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer) and Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet) for QR code deblurring, using explicit edge priors to improve decoding rates and dynamically selecting networks based on blur severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for QR code deblurring rarely exploit the explicit edge priors inherent in QR codes' highly structured patterns, while current approaches don't adapt to varying blur severity levels.

Method: Developed Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) to embed explicit edge priors into Transformer architecture, created EG-Restormer for severe blur and LENet for mild blur, then integrated them into ADNet that dynamically selects network based on input blur severity.

Result: EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with competitive speed, significantly boosting decoding rates for severely blurred QR codes.

Conclusion: The proposed edge-guided approach and adaptive dual-network architecture effectively leverage QR code structural priors and provide efficient deblurring suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices.

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

*Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Zhifei Yang,Yu Liu,Ruijie Lu,Song-Chun Zhu,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that leverages planar structures to derive accurate metric-scale depth maps for 3D scene reconstruction, addressing limitations in existing generative approaches by providing reliable geometric supervision and improving multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using generative priors from diffusion models struggle with poor reconstruction quality due to lack of geometric supervision and multi-view inconsistencies, leading to shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry.

Method: The method leverages planar structures to create accurate metric-scale depth maps, incorporates geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline, improves visibility mask estimation, guides novel view selection, and enhances multi-view consistency when inpainting with video diffusion models.

Result: Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show consistent outperformance of existing baselines in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. The method also supports single-view inputs and unposed videos with strong generalizability.

Conclusion: Accurate geometry is fundamental for effectively exploiting generative models in 3D scene reconstruction, and the proposed approach provides reliable geometric supervision that enables high-quality reconstruction in both observed and unobserved regions across various scenarios.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework with Incremental Parallel Adapter network and Decoupled Anchor Supervision to address challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in non-rehearsal CIL: large model complexity, non-smooth representation shifts during incremental learning, and inconsistency between stage-wise optimization and global inference.

Method: Uses Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network built on pre-trained models that learns lightweight adapters with minimal parameters, connected via transfer gates for smooth representation propagation. Implements Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) that separates positive and negative sample constraints using virtual anchors.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show DRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL framework effectively addresses the core challenges in non-rehearsal CIL through efficient adapter-based architecture and decoupled supervision, achieving superior performance with smooth representation transitions and aligned feature spaces.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

### [16] [Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion Model for Old-Photo Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12114)
*Wenjie Li,Xiangyi Wang,Heng Guo,Guangwei Gao,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDiff is a self-supervised selective-guided diffusion method for old-photo face restoration that uses pseudo-reference faces for staged structural and color guidance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-guided methods struggle with localized artifacts and face color in old-photo restoration due to reliance on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance.

Method: Leverages pseudo-reference faces from pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance, uses face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration, applies staged supervision with structural guidance throughout denoising and color refinement in later steps.

Result: Outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability on the constructed VintageFace benchmark of 300 real old photos.

Conclusion: SSDiff effectively addresses compounded degradations in old-photo restoration through selective guidance and staged supervision, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: ImageSentinel is a framework that protects visual datasets from unauthorized use in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) systems by generating sentinel images with embedded character sequences as retrieval keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about unauthorized use of private image datasets in RAIG systems, as traditional watermarking methods fail due to complex feature extraction processes that don't preserve watermarks.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to synthesize sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with original datasets, embedding randomly generated character sequences as retrieval keys for protection verification.

Result: Experimental results show ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Conclusion: ImageSentinel provides an effective solution for protecting visual datasets in RAIG systems, overcoming limitations of traditional watermarking approaches.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

TL;DR: The paper presents a constrained optimization approach using gradient descent to design practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging that work within hardware limitations like bandwidth and peak power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-photon cameras face performance limitations due to hardware constraints (system bandwidth, laser power, sensor data rates, memory/compute resources). Traditional compressive histograms underperform under real-world illumination hardware constraints.

Method: A constrained optimization approach using gradient descent to jointly optimize illumination and coding matrix (coding functions) that adhere to hardware constraints.

Result: The optimized coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints, with particular advantage in peak-power-constrained systems. The approach also adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses.

Conclusion: The proposed constrained optimization method enables practical compressive single-photon 3D imaging that works effectively within real-world hardware limitations and adapts to various system characteristics.

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow and MetaCaptioner provide a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution that can benefit future multimodal research.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Motivation: Remote physiological measurement requires privacy-sensitive data collection and existing methods rely on labeled client data, creating challenges for updating deployed models with unlabeled user data.

Method: FedHUG framework with: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module that dynamically adjusts weights based on bias evaluation for heterogeneous non-IID features; (2) Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller that parameterizes label distribution and manipulates client training strategies.

Conclusion: FedHUG effectively addresses federated unsupervised domain generalization challenges in remote physiological measurement while maintaining privacy and handling label scarcity.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data

called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

### [21] [Class-aware Domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12150)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFF method for Continual Test-Time Adaptation uses class-aware domain knowledge fusion and fission to dynamically accumulate discriminative historical knowledge while avoiding negative knowledge interference from old domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge and insufficient learning of new knowledge when dealing with irregular domain switching, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes KFF with two modules: Knowledge Fission (KFI) to separate new domain knowledge from class-aware prompt pool, and Knowledge Fusion (KFU) to merge new knowledge into existing pool using greedy dynamic merging strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-C dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: KFF successfully addresses the challenges of CTTA by adaptively managing domain knowledge through fission and fusion operations, achieving better performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

*Ziyuan Gao,Philippe Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPL introduces diffusion-based prototype learning for one-shot medical image segmentation, modeling prototypes as probability distributions to generate diverse variants from limited data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prototype methods fail to capture intra-class diversity due to deterministic averaging of support features, leading to brittle representations that don't generalize well across significant anatomical variability in medical images.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) diffusion-based prototype enhancement module using forward-reverse processes, (2) spatial-aware conditioning using geometric properties from feature statistics, (3) conservative fusion strategy balancing fidelity and diversity. Uses same diffusion pipeline in training and inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements and establish new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: DPL successfully addresses prototype representation challenges in one-shot medical segmentation by modeling prototypes as learnable distributions, enabling robust generalization through controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent variants.

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes State Space Prompting (SSP) for video understanding, which uses intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to better capture spatiotemporal information in videos, outperforming SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing fine-tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained state space models for video classification sequentially compress visual tokens but fail to capture spatial and temporal contextual information effectively, limiting the propagation of discriminative information across frames.

Method: Proposed State Space Prompting (SSP) with two modules: Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) to aggregate spatial key information within frames, and Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) to spread discriminative spatiotemporal information across frames, adaptively balancing and compressing key information.

Result: Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets show SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing fine-tuning parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos through complementary intra-frame and inter-frame prompting, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction with geometric consistency across different modalities (RGB, depth, normals, semantics) while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with CUDA-accelerated rasterization, redesigns depth rendering via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection, derives analytic gradients for surface normal rendering, and introduces learnable attributes for differentiable pruning of Gaussians.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities, with improved geometric consistency and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware paradigm effectively enables high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction with superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

TL;DR: BEEP3D is a novel end-to-end framework for 3D instance segmentation using only box-level supervision, eliminating the need for expensive point-level annotations while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the substantial annotation costs and labor overhead of fully supervised 3D instance segmentation methods that require dense point-level annotations, by leveraging more scalable box-level supervision.

Method: Uses a student-teacher framework with Exponential Moving Average updates, instance center-based query refinement for precise pseudo-mask generation, and two novel losses (query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss) to align semantic and geometric signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets show BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BEEP3D provides an effective end-to-end solution for box-supervised 3D instance segmentation that overcomes the limitations of two-stage pipelines and achieves strong performance with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Method: Proposes CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework where IL and RL agents interact during training through a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts, moving beyond the conventional two-stage IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning approach.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD effectively combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning through competitive interaction, demonstrating superior performance in autonomous driving tasks with better generalization and safety metrics.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill rich visual perception abilities from larger teacher MLLMs to smaller student models, with visual attention misalignment identified as the main cause.

Method: Proposes CompoDistill framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with the teacher's to enhance visual perception abilities through systematic attention alignment.

Result: Significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, and demonstrates effectiveness with advanced backbones.

Conclusion: CompoDistill effectively addresses visual attention misalignment in MLLM knowledge distillation, enhancing visual perception capabilities in smaller models while maintaining generalizability.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

TL;DR: EReLiFM is a meta-learning approach for Open-Set Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels that uses evidential loss clustering and residual flow matching to handle domain gaps and label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise corrupts source-domain knowledge in OSDG, making it difficult to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. Existing hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning methods struggle with domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data.

Method: Proposes EReLiFM with: 1) unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering for label reliability awareness, 2) residual flow matching mechanism modeling structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals for diverse transfer paths, 3) meta-learning optimization where clean set updates maximize loss decrease on noisy set using pseudo labels.

Result: EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed EReLiFM framework effectively addresses the challenges of open-set domain generalization with noisy labels through evidential reliability awareness and residual flow matching.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM

*Shingo Yokoi,Kento Sasaki,Yu Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical reasoning framework using vision-language models for generating incident reports from dashcam videos, achieving 2nd place in the 2COOOL challenge with best CIDEr-D score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in autonomous driving models' performance in out-of-distribution scenarios by improving hazard understanding and generating human-interpretable incident reports.

Method: Hierarchical reasoning framework integrating frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models, enhanced by model ensembling and Blind A/B Scoring selection.

Result: Ranked 2nd among 29 teams on the official 2COOOL open leaderboard and achieved the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives.

Conclusion: Hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

### [30] [The Impact of Synthetic Data on Object Detection Model Performance: A Comparative Analysis with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12208)
*Muammer Bay,Timo von Marcard,Dren Fazlija*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data from NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator can effectively supplement real-world data for training object detection models in warehouse logistics, with balanced integration yielding robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI applications in logistics/manufacturing face challenges due to lack of expertise/resources, forcing reliance on general models that require costly domain-specific data. Synthetic data offers cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection.

Method: Used NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator to generate synthetic data for pallet detection in warehouse settings. Conducted experiments comparing models trained on real data only vs. various synthetic dataset generation strategies.

Result: Synthetic data significantly impacts object detection model performance. Balanced integration of synthetic and real data leads to robust and efficient models for real-world warehouse scenarios.

Conclusion: Synthetic image data is practically applicable in computer vision for logistics, with mixed synthetic-real data strategies enabling cost-effective development of effective object detection systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

### [31] [DIANet: A Phase-Aware Dual-Stream Network for Micro-Expression Recognition via Dynamic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12219)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIANet is a dual-stream CNN framework that uses phase-aware dynamic images to improve micro-expression recognition by separately modeling onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset temporal phases with cross-attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to subtle, transient facial cues and limited data. Conventional dynamic image methods fail to capture distinct temporal phase characteristics within micro-expressions.

Method: Proposes DIANet with two streams: one for onset-to-apex phase and another for apex-to-offset phase, each processed by dedicated CNNs and integrated via cross-attention fusion module.

Result: Outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based methods on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, MMEW), demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of temporal phase information is crucial for micro-expression recognition, and the dual-stream approach with phase-aware dynamic images represents a promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

*Hritik Bansal,Devandra Singh Sachan,Kai-Wei Chang,Aditya Grover,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-tau Yih,Ramakanth Pasunuru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data curation strategies for vision-language reasoning datasets and introduces HoneyBee, a large-scale chain-of-thought dataset that significantly improves VLM performance across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The principles underlying the construction of performant vision-language reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood, despite recent advances in VLMs.

Method: The authors introduce several data curation approaches including context source strategies, targeted data interventions (auxiliary signals from captions, text-only reasoning), and scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought solutions. They then create HoneyBee, a large-scale CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples.

Result: HoneyBee-trained VLMs outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes, with a 3B parameter model achieving 7.8% and 24.8% improvements over SOTA and base models respectively on MathVerse. The proposed test-time scaling strategy reduces decoding cost by 73% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: This work presents improved strategies for vision-language reasoning dataset curation, demonstrating that careful data construction significantly enhances VLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

*Victor Besnier,David Hurych,Andrei Bursuc,Eduardo Valle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-correcting image generation method that combines auto-regressive token modeling with multi-token prediction, using iterative token refinement to fix structural inconsistencies while maintaining inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in image/video generation is crucial for commercial viability and scientific progress. While multi-token prediction reduces inference time, it introduces structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities that traditional methods cannot backtrack and fix.

Method: Proposes iterative token refinement with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context to improve robustness and enable token fixing during sampling, preserving parallel token prediction efficiency.

Result: Evaluated on ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 for images, and UCF-101 and NuScenes for videos, showing substantial improvements in generation quality across both modalities while maintaining efficiency benefits.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses structural inconsistencies in parallel token prediction through self-correction, achieving both improved generation quality and preserved inference efficiency in image and video generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ivan-ISTD, a doubly wavelet-guided invariance learning framework for infrared small target detection that addresses cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise through wavelet-guided cross-domain synthesis and real-domain noise invariance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the dual challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in infrared small target detection for drone-based multi-modality sensing applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis for domain alignment using multi-frequency wavelet filtering, 2) Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning that extracts real noise characteristics to build dynamic noise library and learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Validated on Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark and other real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD effectively addresses cross-domain challenges and noise perturbations in infrared small target detection, providing superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

### [35] [Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256)
*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes for robust video representation that overcomes limitations of pixel-level tracking by handling occlusions, large motions, and tracking errors while enabling controllable video editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video representations rely on unstable pixel-level matching and tracking, which fail with tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions. Need a more robust representation that can handle these challenges.

Method: Uses hierarchical proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes, with dynamic representation update mechanism leveraging spatio-temporal priors. Features decoupled encoding of shape and texture representations across visual objects.

Result: Achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters, handles drastic scene/object changes, and supports complex video processing tasks like in-painting and temporally consistent video editing.

Conclusion: Proxy node-based representation provides robust video modeling that overcomes tracking vulnerabilities while enabling fine-grained appearance editing and supporting various video processing applications.

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

### [36] [Multiplicative Loss for Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in Medical and Cellular Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12258)
*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two novel loss functions - Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss - for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images that outperform traditional additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust training objectives. Traditional additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are sensitive to hyperparameters and perform suboptimally with limited data.

Method: Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively to dynamically modulate gradients based on prediction confidence. Confidence-Adaptive version applies confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.

Result: Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions offer a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

*Jinlun Ye,Zhuohao Sun,Yiqiao Qiu,Qiu Li,Zhijun Tan,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using local background features from in-distribution (ID) images as fake OOD features during training to improve OOD detection by reducing model overconfidence on OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data, and existing methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generated fake OOD images have high data collection and training costs.

Method: Extract background features from ID images as simulated OOD representations during training, leveraging local convolution invariance. Optimize networks to reduce L2-norm of these background features to alleviate overconfidence on OOD data.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks show effectiveness and wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves OOD detection by using local background features as fake OOD features, addressing overconfidence issues without requiring expensive auxiliary datasets.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

*Xiaopeng Liu,Yupei Lin,Sen Zhang,Xiao Wang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngularFuse is a novel visible-infrared image fusion framework that addresses limitations in existing unsupervised methods by introducing cross-modal complementary learning, fine-grained reference image synthesis, and angle-aware loss that simultaneously constrains gradient magnitude and direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised fusion methods rely on manually designed loss functions with limitations: constructed reference images lack details and have uneven brightness, and widely used gradient losses only focus on gradient magnitude while ignoring direction.

Method: Proposes AngularFuse with three key components: 1) Cross-modal complementary mask module to force learning complementary information between modalities, 2) Fine-grained reference image synthesis combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, 3) Angle-aware loss that constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons confirm sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes.

Conclusion: AngularFuse demonstrates superior fusion capability by preserving both texture intensity and correct edge orientation, producing enhanced images better suited for downstream tasks in autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance applications.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily assess general medical tasks and inadequately capture performance in nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input.

Method: Built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from open-source spinal disease datasets, with challenging hard negative options based on visual similarity to simulate real-world scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading MLLMs revealed poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current models in the spine domain.

Conclusion: SpineBench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that guides future improvements in spinal medicine applications for MLLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGS introduces a semantic-aware 3D reconstruction framework that prioritizes safety-critical objects over static backgrounds, achieving high-quality reconstruction with 350+ FPS rendering speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction methods face a trade-off between fidelity and computational cost due to semantically agnostic resource allocation that treats all scene elements equally.

Method: PAGS uses two core techniques: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization with hybrid importance metrics to simplify non-critical elements while preserving safety-critical objects, and (2) Priority-Driven Rendering with priority-based depth pre-pass to cull occluded primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo and KITTI datasets show exceptional reconstruction quality on safety-critical objects while significantly reducing training time and achieving over 350 FPS rendering speeds.

Conclusion: PAGS successfully addresses the fidelity-efficiency trade-off in dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction by incorporating semantic priorities, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

*Jianfeng Dong,Lei Huang,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xun Yang,Changting Lin,Xun Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DL-DKD++, a dual learning framework with dynamic knowledge distillation for partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) that transfers knowledge from large vision-language models to lightweight task-specific networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video retrieval methods assume pre-trimmed short videos, but real-world videos are untrimmed and contain complex background content, requiring handling partial relevance.

Method: Uses a teacher-student framework where a large teacher model supervises a dual-branch student network (inheritance branch for transferable knowledge, exploration branch for task-specific learning) with dynamic soft-target construction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-DKD++ framework effectively addresses the practical challenge of partially relevant video retrieval by combining knowledge distillation with dual-branch learning and dynamic target construction.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs suffer from logo hallucinations, generating brand names from logos without visible text. The study reveals this occurs due to symbolic priors rather than genuine perception, with projector dimensions playing a key role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate logo hallucination in VLMs where models generate brand names from logos containing no visible words, revealing a critical vulnerability in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Used curated logo datasets (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing), Hard-60 subset, and nine structured perturbations. Conducted embedding-level analysis with LLaVA and targeted ablation of projector dimensions.

Result: Hallucinations persist under strong distortions, with occlusion being most revealing. Targeted ablation of specific projector dimensions substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for circular logos. Projector subspaces are critical in this failure mode, suggesting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

### [43] [Hybrid Gaussian Splatting for Novel Urban View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12308)
*Mohamed Omran,Farhad Zanjani,Davide Abati,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining Gaussian splatting for 3D scene reconstruction and diffusion models for image enhancement achieves second place in the RealADSim-NVS challenge for novel view synthesis in street scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating novel views of urban environments from different traversals (e.g., different street lanes or directions) using car-centric training frames.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fit 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian splatting and render novel views from target cameras, 2) Enhance frames with a single-step diffusion model. Includes specific techniques for Gaussian primitive initialization and enhancer model fine-tuning with curated training data.

Result: Achieved aggregated score of 0.432 on public test leaderboard, securing second place overall. Performance evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics for novel view quality.

Conclusion: The hybrid method combining 3D reconstruction and diffusion-based enhancement effectively addresses novel view synthesis in street scenes, demonstrating competitive performance in the RealADSim-NVS challenge.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

*Jinzhou Lin,Jie Zhou,Wenhao Xu,Rongtao Xu,Changwei Wang,Shunpeng Chen,Kexue Fu,Yihua Shao,Li Guo,Shibiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurriFlow is a semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion for 3D semantic scene completion from monocular images, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision, limiting camera-based perception in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses multi-level fusion to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames with pre-trained optical flow, curriculum learning to transition from LiDAR to stereo depth, and semantic priors from SAM for category-agnostic supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI benchmark with mean IoU of 16.9, demonstrating improved temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding.

Conclusion: CurriFlow's motion-guided and curriculum-aware design effectively addresses challenges in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, providing robust geometric and semantic understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an attention-guided learnable subsampling framework that dynamically adapts to inputs during inference, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance in 3D medical imaging and ultrasound video classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often achieve performance gains at the cost of increased computational complexity, with inherent redundancies in data like 3D volumes or videos where not all slices/frames are necessary.

Method: Developed an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to different inputs during inference, overcoming the non-differentiability of subsampling operations using dynamic adaptation rather than static approaches like Gumbel-max trick.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets, including a challenging real-world clinical dataset, showing performance gains and reduced complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed input-adaptive subsampling framework successfully addresses computational complexity issues in deep neural networks while maintaining or improving performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM-PSR is a dual-stream framework for procedure step recognition that combines spatial and temporal features to handle partial occlusion, reducing prediction delays by 11.2-26.1% compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSR models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual frames, neglecting temporal features which limits robustness and accuracy, especially when objects are partially occluded.

Method: Dual-stream framework with assembly state detection stream for unobstructed views and spatio-temporal stream with spatial encoder (pre-trained using weak supervision) and transformer-based temporal encoder to capture spatial-temporal relationships under occlusion.

Result: Reduced average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% on MECCANO and 26.1% on IndustReal datasets compared to prior methods, with spatio-temporal stream enabling occlusion-resilient step recognition.

Conclusion: STORM-PSR effectively addresses occlusion challenges in PSR by leveraging both spatial and temporal features, demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness without requiring unobstructed object views.

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

*Wenjing Bian,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic reinterpretation of scene coordinate regression (SCR) models that incorporates reconstruction priors to prevent degeneration when training images have insufficient multi-view constraints, improving scene representations and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR models trained with insufficient multi-view constraints can degenerate, so the paper aims to prevent this by incorporating high-level reconstruction priors during training.

Method: Developed probabilistic reinterpretation of SCR training that infuses various priors - from simple depth distribution priors to learned 3D point cloud diffusion models trained on large indoor scan datasets - to push predicted 3D scene points toward plausible geometry.

Result: On three indoor datasets, the priors helped learn better scene representations, resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates, better camera poses, and improved performance on downstream tasks like novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating reconstruction priors during SCR model training effectively prevents degeneration and improves scene representation quality and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This systematic review examines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for urban infrastructure monitoring, analyzing 32 studies from 2021-2025 to understand their effectiveness in zero-shot applications, preferred architectures, datasets, and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban monitoring using IoT sensors and manual inspections is costly, difficult to scale, and misaligned with citizens' visual perception. The paper explores whether machines can 'see' like citizens to assess urban infrastructure conditions.

Method: Following PRISMA methodology, the authors systematically reviewed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021-2025, addressing four research questions about VLM applications in urban monitoring tasks, architectures, datasets, and evaluation approaches.

Result: The review identified effective urban monitoring tasks addressed by VLMs, commonly used VLM architectures with superior performance, available datasets and resources, and reported performance levels across different evaluation methods.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise as a technology for urban infrastructure monitoring by integrating visual understanding with natural language reasoning, potentially overcoming limitations of traditional monitoring approaches and aligning better with citizen visual perception.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework for image quality transfer, specifically applied to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from low-field MRI inputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI (LF-MRI) offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. There is a need to bridge the quality gap between low-field and high-field MRI without requiring expensive infrastructure.

Method: The proposed method uses conditional flow matching (CFM) which learns a continuous flow between noise distribution and target data distributions through direct regression of an optimal velocity field, unlike conventional generative models that rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives.

Result: Experiments show CFM achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, and utilizes significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: CFM demonstrates strong potential as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLucy is a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding that uses hierarchical memory structure and agent-based iterative backtracking to overcome limitations of current LLM-based systems in capturing temporal context and preserving critical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based systems using LLMs for long video understanding struggle with capturing temporal context of consecutive frames and risk discarding crucial information due to sparse frame sampling.

Method: VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity and an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism to systematically mine video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered.

Result: VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed VideoLucy framework effectively addresses temporal understanding challenges while preserving critical details in long video understanding, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG), focusing on Chest X-ray imaging. It examines dataset construction, report generation architectures with longitudinal designs, evaluation protocols, and identifies limitations and future directions in this emerging field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray imaging creates substantial workloads for radiologists, and conventional single-image approaches fail to capture longitudinal context necessary for clinically faithful comparison statements. Existing surveys primarily address single image report generation and offer limited guidance for longitudinal settings.

Method: The survey comprehensively reviews longitudinal radiology report generation by examining: dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures with longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols including longitudinal-specific measures and widely used benchmarks.

Result: The analysis highlights the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. It summarizes LRRG methods' performance and different ablation studies.

Conclusion: The survey identifies five major limitations of current research and outlines promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a foundation for advancing longitudinal radiology report generation as an emerging field.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA is a two-stage framework that generates transferable and imperceptible adversarial examples against deepfake detectors using dual-stream attacks and metric-aware selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create effective adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors in black-box settings where model internals are unknown, focusing on both transferability across unseen models and visual imperceptibility.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses dual-stream attack (MNTD-PGD for small perturbation optimization and SG-PGD for salient region targeting) to generate candidates; Stage 2 employs metric-aware selection based on success rates and SSIM similarity.

Result: Achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art attacks while maintaining visual imperceptibility.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA successfully demonstrates that jointly optimizing transferability and imperceptibility through complementary attack strategies and metric-aware selection significantly improves adversarial attack effectiveness against deepfake detectors.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, with visualization showing accurate region localization.

Conclusion: The proposed early fusion approach effectively preserves spatial consistency and improves performance in text-guided medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting (BSGS) addresses 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images by using a two-stage approach with camera pose refinement and global rigid transformation, plus subframe gradient aggregation and space-time optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods suffer from extreme dependence on accurate camera poses and inability to control erroneous Gaussian primitive densification caused by motion blur, limiting their performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Camera Pose Refinement to optimize camera poses and reduce motion distortions; 2) Global Rigid Transformation with fixed poses to correct blur distortions. Uses subframe gradient aggregation to handle multi-subframe gradient conflicts and space-time bi-stage optimization to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds.

Result: Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed deblurring method and demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BSGS successfully addresses the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images through its bi-stage approach and optimization strategies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

TL;DR: VAD is a lightweight, network-free method that computes Unsigned Distance Fields from unoriented point clouds using Voronoi-based normal alignment and diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for learning UDFs suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability.

Method: The method assigns bi-directional normals using Voronoi-based geometric criteria, diffuses them to form an approximate UDF gradient field, and integrates to recover the final UDF.

Result: VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: The proposed VAD method provides a stable and efficient alternative to neural approaches for computing UDFs from point clouds.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on over-parameterized features and auxiliary losses, which should not be necessary for diffusion models to match human motion distribution.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

### [57] [Reasoning in the Dark: Interleaved Vision-Text Reasoning in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12603)
*Chao Chen,Zhixin Ma,Yongqi Li,Yupeng Hu,Yinwei Wei,Wenjie Li,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IVT-LR introduces multimodal latent reasoning that combines visual and textual information in latent space to enable efficient multimodal reasoning without explicit vision-text annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and introduce significant inference latency due to explicit reasoning steps.

Method: Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR) represents reasoning steps using latent text (hidden states) and latent vision (selected image embeddings) in latent space, with progressive multi-stage training.

Result: Achieves 5.45% average accuracy improvement on M3CoT and ScienceQA benchmarks while achieving over 5x speed increase compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: IVT-LR provides an effective solution for multimodal reasoning that reduces annotation requirements and improves inference efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMOT introduces the first drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking benchmark with 125 videos and 488.8K annotations, plus a spectral-aware tracking method that significantly outperforms RGB baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based tracking algorithms degrade in aerial views due to small targets, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Multispectral imagery provides spectral reflectance cues that enhance object discriminability, but lack of dedicated datasets has hindered progress.

Method: Proposes MMOT benchmark with large scale (125 sequences), comprehensive challenges, and oriented annotations. Presents a multispectral tracking scheme with Spectral 3D-Stem for feature integration, orientation-aware Kalman filter, and end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects.

Conclusion: The work advances drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research by providing the first dedicated benchmark and demonstrating the superiority of spectral features over RGB for aerial tracking tasks.

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

*Quang Nguyen,Tri Le,Baoru Huang,Minh Nhat Vu,Ngan Le,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporally Conditional Mamba (TCM) is a new mamba-based model that improves human motion generation by integrating conditional information into recurrent dynamics, achieving better temporal alignment than cross-attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using cross-attention struggle with step-by-step temporal alignment in human motion generation from time-dependent inputs, despite the importance of maintaining temporal patterns.

Method: Integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of Mamba blocks rather than using cross-attention, enabling better temporal alignment in motion generation.

Result: Significantly improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches across various human motion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Temporally Conditional Mamba model effectively addresses temporal alignment limitations in human motion generation by leveraging recurrent dynamics for conditional integration.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

*Shelley Zixin Shu,Haozhe Luo,Alexander Poellinger,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes H-EGL framework combining self-supervised and human-guided constraints to improve attention alignment in medical imaging transformers, enhancing generalization without costly manual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models in medical imaging suffer from spurious correlations and biases, while human-AI attention alignment requires expensive manual supervision.

Method: Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework with self-supervised component using class-distinctive attention without restrictive priors, combined with human-guided constraints.

Result: Outperforms two state-of-the-art EGL methods on chest X-ray classification with ViT, achieving superior accuracy, generalization, and better attention map alignment with human expertise.

Conclusion: H-EGL effectively enhances attention alignment and generalization in medical imaging transformers without relying on costly manual supervision.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot agricultural segmentation using Plantnet's plant representations with DinoV2 backbone and SAM refinement, achieving improved performance without new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the annotation bottleneck and limitations of purely supervised methods in agricultural imagery segmentation, especially in complex field conditions with limited training data.

Method: Leverages Plantnet's specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and generate coarse masks, then refines them using Segment Anything Model (SAM) for detailed segmentations.

Result: Consistent performance gains with Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over base DinoV2 model across four datasets of varying complexity, measured by Jaccard Index (IoU).

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models effectively alleviates annotation requirements and enables robust segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IRIS, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to actively manipulate and reason with images through tools, moving beyond passive visual perception to a 'think with images' paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat images as static inputs rather than manipulable cognitive workspaces, limiting their ability to solve complex real-world tasks that require active image transformations and tool integration.

Method: Created IRIS benchmark with 1,204 challenging vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) across five domains, evaluating MLLMs' perception, transformation, and reasoning capabilities with detailed rubrics.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle significantly, with the strongest model (GPT-5-think) achieving only 18.68% pass rate. Models show divergent tool-use behaviors - OpenAI models benefit from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement.

Conclusion: IRIS provides the first benchmark for 'think with images' paradigm, revealing critical limitations in MLLMs' visual intelligence and offering insights for advancing their ability to dynamically interact with visual content.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync is a domain-agnostic approach that improves diffusion model training by using the model's own intermediate representations as intrinsic guidance, eliminating the need for external supervision while boosting training efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research showed that external guidance on intermediate representations accelerates diffusion model training, but this requires additional resources. The authors aim to create a self-sufficient method that leverages the model's own representations without external dependencies.

Method: LayerSync regularizes diffusion models by using semantically rich intermediate representations from certain layers to guide weaker representations in other layers. It's implemented as a plug-and-play regularizer term that requires no pretrained models, additional data, or training overhead.

Result: LayerSync consistently improves generation quality and training efficiency across multiple domains. It achieved 8.75x faster training for flow-based transformers on ImageNet and 23.6% improvement in generation quality. The method also demonstrated effectiveness in audio, video, and motion generation.

Conclusion: LayerSync provides an effective, self-sufficient approach for improving diffusion models by leveraging internal representations as intrinsic guidance, making it broadly applicable across visual and non-visual domains without requiring external resources.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

*Jiachen Lei,Keli Liu,Julius Berner,Haiming Yu,Hongkai Zheng,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage training framework that closes the performance gap between pixel-space and latent-space generative models by pre-training encoders on clean images aligned with sampling trajectories, then fine-tuning end-to-end.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space generative models underperform compared to latent-space counterparts, creating a persistent performance and efficiency gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) pre-train encoders to capture semantics from clean images while aligning with deterministic sampling trajectories, (2) integrate encoder with randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models.

Result: Achieved FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 NFE for diffusion models, and FID of 8.82 in single step for consistency model on ImageNet-256 - significantly surpassing prior pixel-space methods and rivaling VAE-based models.

Conclusion: Successfully closed the performance gap for pixel-space models, enabling first successful training of consistency models directly on high-resolution images without pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench is a new VQA benchmark for cultural heritage that uses multi-agent collaboration to generate nuanced questions, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs including counting weaknesses and performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding in complex domains like visual art analysis, incentivizing models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning.

Method: A novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions for cultural heritage visual analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed significant limitations, including surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have substantial limitations in deep visual understanding, particularly in complex domains like cultural heritage, highlighting the need for more sophisticated benchmarks and model improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D introduces uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting to improve 4D scene reconstruction by modeling per-Gaussian uncertainty and using it to guide motion optimization through spatio-temporal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular input is under-constrained with ambiguities from occlusion and extreme views. Vanilla dynamic Gaussian Splatting optimizes all primitives uniformly, leading to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis at unseen viewpoints.

Method: Estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Gaussians with recurring observations serve as reliable anchors to guide motion, while those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable.

Result: Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show consistent improvements over dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling uncertainty in dynamic Gaussian Splatting frameworks significantly enhances 4D reconstruction quality, particularly improving stability under occlusion and performance at extreme viewing angles.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing USOD methods ignore underwater imaging physics or treat degradation as interference, failing to exploit valuable information in underwater images.

Method: Proposes WaterFlow framework using rectified flow with explicit underwater physical imaging priors and temporal dimension modeling for salient object identification.

Result: Achieves 0.072 gain in S_m metric on USOD10K dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: WaterFlow successfully incorporates underwater physical principles into network training and shows significant performance improvements in underwater salient object detection.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D is a video diffusion model that generates animatable multi-view 4D human avatars from a single reference image and target expressions, improving realism and 3D consistency over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating photorealistic human avatars are expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera rigs and manual effort. While recent single-image approaches lower barriers, they lack multi-view constraints and degrade when viewpoints deviate from the reference.

Method: Based on a pre-trained video diffusion model, MVP4D generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying up to 360 degrees around the subject, then distills outputs into a real-time renderable 4D avatar.

Result: The approach significantly improves realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: MVP4D enables efficient creation of high-quality animatable 4D human avatars from single images, advancing digital human simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

TL;DR: ZSCFC is an efficient zero-shot denoiser that uses cross-frequency consistency to denoise single images without noise distribution assumptions, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot denoisers have long training times and rely on unrealistic noise assumptions (independence and zero-mean), limiting their effectiveness for real-world denoising where noise characteristics are complex.

Method: Proposes ZSCFC method based on cross-frequency consistency - image textures show position similarity and content consistency across frequency bands while noise doesn't. Uses cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network for single-image denoising.

Result: Experiments on various real-world image datasets show ZSCFC outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC provides an effective and efficient solution for real-world denoising that works with single noisy images without requiring assumptions about noise distribution.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion is a diffusion-based generative model that uses a frozen vision-language model as a unified multimodal encoder, featuring Layerwise Attention Pooling for better cross-modal reasoning and VERIFI mechanism for flexible inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures use separate encoders for images and text, limiting cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Previous unified approaches require substantial computational resources, making them inaccessible.

Method: Uses frozen VLM as unified encoder with Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to extract both high-level semantics and low-level details. Proposes VERIFI mechanism for in-model prompt rewriting and flexible inference with diffusion transformer.

Result: LAP outperforms shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment. Finetuning on editing improves alignment and shows cross-modality knowledge transfer. Model generalizes zero-shot to multiple image references when trained on single image editing.

Conclusion: UniFusion demonstrates effective cross-modal knowledge transfer through unified encoder design, showing improved alignment and generalization capabilities while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

### [71] [On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12660)
*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops lightweight human mesh recovery (HMR) and human pose estimation (HPE) models by using only early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders, achieving comparable performance to full models with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art HMR methods rely on large non-hierarchical vision transformers, which are computationally expensive. The authors aim to create more efficient alternatives by leveraging the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with sufficient resolution.

Method: Constructed lightweight HMR2.0 variants using ViTPose models, and proposed using only the first 2-3 stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, VMamba) as encoders instead of full models.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based models showed that truncated models using only early stages achieve performance comparable to full-stage models while offering better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than existing lightweight alternatives.

Conclusion: Using early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders provides an effective approach for developing efficient HMR and HPE models without sacrificing performance, establishing better computational efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay is a differentiable vectorization layer that integrates Cubical Multiparameter Persistence into deep learning, enabling joint learning of bifiltration functions and providing robust topological features for image analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) is a powerful topological approach for image analysis but faces challenges in multifiltration complexity and vectorization, limiting its integration into deep learning pipelines.

Method: Introduces a novel algorithm that decomposes CMP into learnable single-parameter persistence components, where bifiltration functions are jointly learned, creating differentiable topological feature vectors compatible with modern architectures like Swin Transformers.

Result: Experiments on medical imaging and computer vision datasets demonstrate improved classification and segmentation performance, especially in limited-data scenarios, with theoretical stability guarantees under generalized Wasserstein metrics.

Conclusion: CuMPerLay provides an effective approach for integrating global structural topological information into deep networks, offering promising directions for structured image analysis.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC) is a family of learned compression algorithms specifically designed for Earth observation satellite imagery, achieving 3-10x better compression than classical codecs while enabling zero-shot cloud inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation satellites generate massive multispectral image time series that pose storage and transmission challenges. Current learned compression methods are fragmented and misaligned with advances in natural image compression, while traditional codecs fail to capture temporal redundancy in largely static scenes.

Method: TEC includes image-based variants for multispectral inputs and a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages temporal dependencies. The authors introduce Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that can operate at varying rate-distortion settings.

Result: Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs with 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. TEC-TT also enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark.

Conclusion: Bespoke, learned compression algorithms represent a promising direction for Earth observation, with TerraCodec demonstrating significant improvements in both compression efficiency and additional capabilities like cloud inpainting.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

*Yingyan Li,Shuyao Shang,Weisong Liu,Bing Zhan,Haochen Wang,Yuqi Wang,Yuntao Chen,Xiaoman Wang,Yasong An,Chufeng Tang,Lu Hou,Lue Fan,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0 addresses the supervision deficit in Vision-Language-Action models by using world modeling to predict future images, creating dense self-supervised signals that improve driving intelligence and data scaling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models suffer from supervision deficit where their large capacity is underutilized due to sparse, low-dimensional action supervision, limiting their ability to learn driving environment dynamics.

Method: Proposes DriveVLA-W0 training paradigm using world modeling to predict future images, implemented as autoregressive world model for discrete visual tokens and diffusion world model for continuous visual features, with lightweight action expert for real-time inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines on NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and 680x larger in-house dataset, demonstrating accelerated performance gains with increasing dataset size.

Conclusion: World modeling effectively addresses VLA supervision deficit, enabling better utilization of model capacity and stronger data scaling laws for driving intelligence.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

*Zefu Lin,Wenbo Chen,Xiaojuan Jin,Yuran Yang,Lue Fan,Yixin Zhang,Yufeng Zhang,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework that addresses limitations of BEV-based approaches by preserving 3D spatial structures and semantics while reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV-based approaches for UAV swarm systems have limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic/geometric information, and performance degrades with undefined/occluded objects.

Method: Proposed framework integrates Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration, with Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction for efficiency and Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance for adaptive feature selection and reduced communication.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforms existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of BEV-based approaches for UAV collaborative perception, providing superior performance with significantly reduced communication requirements.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

### [76] [Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning of Vision Foundation Models for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12741)
*Adam Tupper,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a personalized federated fine-tuning method using orthogonal LoRA adapters to separate general and client-specific knowledge, enabling better use of both local and external data in healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in healthcare need fine-tuning for specific tasks but face data scarcity due to privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing across institutions. Federated learning offers a solution but needs better personalization.

Method: Uses orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general knowledge (shared across clients) from client-specific knowledge, allowing each client to leverage both their own data and data from other sources through federated learning.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks show the approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed personalized federated fine-tuning method effectively addresses data scarcity and privacy concerns in healthcare by enabling better knowledge sharing while maintaining personalization through orthogonal adapter learning.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

*Junhao Zhuang,Shi Guo,Xin Cai,Xiaohui Li,Yihao Liu,Chun Yuan,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR is a diffusion-based one-step streaming framework for real-time video super-resolution that achieves ~17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on A100 GPU through three innovations: train-friendly distillation, sparse attention, and tiny conditional decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video super-resolution methods suffer from high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Three complementary innovations: (1) train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline for streaming super-resolution, (2) locality-constrained sparse attention to reduce redundant computation and bridge train-test resolution gap, (3) tiny conditional decoder for accelerated reconstruction without quality loss. Also created VSR-120K dataset with 120k videos and 180k images.

Result: FlashVSR achieves ~17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on single A100 GPU, scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions, achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.

Conclusion: FlashVSR makes diffusion-based video super-resolution practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance, with code, models, and dataset to be released for future research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

### [78] [SPORTS: Simultaneous Panoptic Odometry, Rendering, Tracking and Segmentation for Urban Scenes Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12749)
*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS is a unified framework that integrates Video Panoptic Segmentation, Visual Odometry, and Scene Rendering to address scene understanding challenges like segmentation deficiency and sensor sparsity through iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene perception solutions suffer from segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, sensor data sparsity, and view limitations, which hinder comprehensive scene understanding for embodied AI agents.

Method: The framework tightly integrates three tasks: VPS uses adaptive attention-based geometric fusion with pose, depth, and optical flow alignment; VO combines panoptic segmentation with optical flow for better camera pose estimation; SR transforms sparse point clouds into neural fields for high-fidelity rendering.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show superior performance on odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPORTS demonstrates that iterative integration of VPS, VO, and SR tasks enables holistic scene understanding, overcoming limitations of existing approaches through synergistic task optimization.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MoFlow is an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes 6-DoF ego-motion and optical flow estimation for event cameras using implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches treat optical flow and ego-motion estimation as separate problems, which becomes ill-posed for event cameras due to lack of robust data association and ground truth supervision. Existing methods introduce bias through explicit regularization or converge to suboptimal solutions.

Method: Models camera ego-motion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, incorporating spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases and geometric constraints without explicit depth estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive results with supervised approaches, demonstrating versatility across general 6-DoF motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed E-MoFlow framework successfully unifies ego-motion and optical flow estimation through implicit regularization, overcoming limitations of previous approaches while maintaining geometric consistency in a fully unsupervised paradigm.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: DL-HMC++ is a deep learning approach for head motion correction in PET imaging that predicts rigid head motion from 3D PET raw data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving results comparable to gold-standard hardware-based motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head movement in brain PET imaging causes artifacts and quantification inaccuracies, while hardware-based motion tracking has limited clinical applicability. A data-driven solution is needed to make motion correction accessible in real-world clinical practice.

Method: Deep-learning head motion correction with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) trained in supervised manner using dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external hardware-based tracking. Predicts rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.

Result: DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven methods, producing motion-free images with clear brain structure delineation and reduced artifacts indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Average difference ratios with HMT: 1.2±0.5% for HRRT and 0.5±0.2% for mCT scanners across four radiotracers.

Conclusion: DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven PET head motion correction to eliminate the need for hardware-based tracking, making motion correction accessible to broader clinical populations beyond research settings.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based feature upsamplers require retraining for each feature extractor and don't generalize across different feature types at inference time.

Method: Proposed an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture that doesn't need encoder-specific training.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, preserves feature semantics, and is efficient for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp provides a versatile and high-quality feature upsampling solution that works across various vision features without retraining.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark for Efficient Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR) that achieves better perceptual quality than Real-ESRGAN while using fewer than 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in efficient perceptual super-resolution methods - while efficient PSNR-oriented approaches exist, perceptual quality methods remain inefficient. The goal is to match or exceed Real-ESRGAN's perceptual results under strict efficiency constraints.

Method: Developed efficient perceptual super-resolution approaches constrained to maximum 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs for 960x540 input, evaluated on a novel 500-image 4K dataset with multiple degradation types without original high-quality counterparts.

Result: The top-performing approach outperformed Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets while meeting the efficiency constraints, demonstrating that efficient methods can achieve superior perceptual quality.

Conclusion: This work establishes modern baselines for efficient perceptual super-resolution, showing that efficient methods can surpass state-of-the-art perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) is a novel framework that predicts local motion distributions conditioned on sparse interactions called "pokes", providing interpretable multi-modal scene dynamics with inherent uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand physical scene dynamics by reasoning about diverse potential changes from local interactions, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that only sample single realizations of scene dynamics.

Method: FPT uses a transformer-based framework to directly predict distributions of local motion conditioned on sparse "poke" interactions, providing interpretable representations of multi-modal scene motion and uncertainties.

Result: FPT surpasses specialized baselines on dense face motion generation, achieves significant improvements on out-of-distribution tasks like articulated object motion estimation, and shows competitive performance on moving part segmentation from pokes.

Conclusion: FPT provides a flexible and versatile approach for modeling scene dynamics with interpretable multi-modal motion distributions, demonstrating strong performance across various downstream tasks and outperforming specialized methods.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

*Weiyang Jin,Yuwei Niu,Jiaqi Liao,Chengqi Duan,Aoxue Li,Shenghua Gao,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM is a self-rewarding post-training framework that enables unified multimodal models to use their understanding module to reward and improve their generation module through a global-local dual reward system, achieving significant performance gains without additional human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a significant gap where unified multimodal models' strong visual understanding capabilities often fail to transfer to their visual generation capabilities, raising the question of whether models can achieve self-improvement by using understanding to reward generation.

Method: SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's understanding module acts as an internal evaluator, providing corrective signals to improve the generation module. It uses a global-local dual reward system with global rewards for overall visual semantics/layout and local rewards for fine-grained object-level fidelity.

Result: SRUM significantly boosts performance on benchmarks: T2I-CompBench improved from 82.18 to 88.37, and T2I-ReasonBench improved from 43.82 to 46.75.

Conclusion: The work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling unified multimodal models' understanding module to guide and enhance their own generation capabilities through self-rewarding, demonstrating strong generalization and performance improvements.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

### [86] [ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793)
*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO is a training method that reduces vision tokens in MLLMs by using multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios and a Visual Resolution Router to dynamically adjust token count based on semantic complexity, achieving up to 50% token reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs suffer from high inference costs due to excessive vision tokens from image inputs, creating a need for more efficient token representation methods.

Method: Uses multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios to downsample vision tokens based on semantic complexity, minimizes KL divergence between responses from different connectors during training, and employs a Visual Resolution Router for automatic compression rate selection at inference.

Result: Reduces vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities of the model.

Conclusion: ViCO contributes to developing more efficient MLLMs by dynamically adapting vision token count according to semantic complexity rather than image resolution.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Qing Jiang,Junan Huo,Xingyu Chen,Yuda Xiong,Zhaoyang Zeng,Yihao Chen,Tianhe Ren,Junzhi Yu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni is a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance comparable to regression-based models through quantized coordinate tokens, multi-data engines, and two-stage training with RL post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in MLLM-based object detection like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, and coordinate misalignment that have prevented them from matching traditional regression-based models.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Quantized coordinate tokens (0-999) for easier learning, 2) Multiple data engines for high-quality grounding data, 3) Two-stage training with SFT on 22M data followed by GRPO-based RL post-training with geometry-aware rewards.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (DINO, Grounding DINO) in zero-shot settings on COCO and LVIS benchmarks, with versatile capabilities in object referring, pointing, OCR, etc.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni bridges the gap between MLLMs and traditional detection models, paving the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

### [88] [DeepMMSearch-R1: Empowering Multimodal LLMs in Multimodal Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12801)
*Kartik Narayan,Yang Xu,Tian Cao,Kavya Nerella,Vishal M. Patel,Navid Shiee,Peter Grasch,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches with dynamic query crafting for both image and text search, using a two-stage training pipeline with reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes for real-world information-seeking tasks.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold start supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning optimization, using a novel multimodal VQA dataset (DeepMMSearchVQA) with automated pipeline and real-world web search information.

Result: Extensive experiments across knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate superiority of the approach, with the model effectively learning when to search, what to search for, which tool to use, and how to reason over retrieved information.

Conclusion: DeepMMSearch-R1 advances multimodal web-search capabilities by enabling dynamic query crafting, self-reflection, and self-correction, providing valuable insights for future multimodal web-search research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares AI agents for Dhumbal card game, finding rule-based Aggressive agent outperforms search-based and learning-based methods with 88.3% win rate through effective Jhyap declarations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI agents for culturally significant Dhumbal card game with imperfect information and advance AI research while supporting digital preservation of cultural games.

Method: Implemented diverse agents: rule-based (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced, Opportunistic), search-based (MCTS, ISMCTS), reinforcement learning (DQN, PPO), and random baseline. Conducted tournaments with 1024 rounds, using statistical tests and performance metrics.

Result: Rule-based Aggressive agent achieved highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]), significantly outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective Jhyap declarations.

Conclusion: Rule-based heuristic approaches can outperform sophisticated search and learning methods in imperfect information games, contributing reproducible AI framework and insights for cultural game preservation.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural

### [90] [Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822)
*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs as evaluators suffer from strong positive bias - they're good at identifying valid outputs but poor at identifying invalid ones, leading to inflated reliability scores. The paper proposes minority-veto strategies and a regression-based framework to mitigate this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: New LLMs emerge frequently, making model selection challenging for developers. Human evaluation is costly and unscalable, while current LLM-as-a-judge approaches have critical flaws due to systematic positive bias.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) an optimal minority-veto strategy resilient to missing data, and 2) a novel regression-based framework that directly models validator bias using small human-annotated ground truth data.

Result: On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, the regression approach reduces maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate LLM evaluator bias, with the regression framework providing particularly high precision for scenarios requiring accurate model assessment.

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAL (Holistic Agent Leaderboard), a standardized evaluation framework for AI agents that addresses challenges in agent evaluation through parallel testing, multi-dimensional analysis, and LLM-aided log inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent evaluations suffer from challenges that undermine understanding of real-world performance, with issues like long evaluation times, implementation bugs, and unreliable benchmark results.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Standardized evaluation harness with parallel VM orchestration, 2) Three-dimensional analysis across models, scaffolds, and benchmarks, 3) LLM-aided log inspection to uncover unreported behaviors. Validated with 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks.

Result: Reduced evaluation time from weeks to hours, identified surprising insights (e.g., higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy), uncovered problematic behaviors like searching for benchmarks instead of solving tasks and misusing credit cards. Shared 2.5B tokens of agent logs.

Conclusion: HAL standardizes agent evaluation and addresses common pitfalls, shifting focus from benchmark performance to real-world reliability, enabling better understanding of agent behavior and incentivizing further research.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench is a benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to interpret scientific literature in clinical genetics, testing extraction of experimental results, evidence strength judgment, and outcome categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variant and gene interpretation methods are manual and labor-intensive. Generative language models can accelerate this process but existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks that don't translate to real-world research.

Method: Built from ClinGen expert-curated literature interpretations, CGBench tests 8 different LMs on three capabilities: extracting experimental results following protocols, judging evidence strength, and categorizing experimental outcomes.

Result: Models show promise but substantial gaps exist in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions. Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks while non-reasoning models are better at high-level interpretations. Models often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying evidence.

Conclusion: CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise scientific literature interpretation, opening avenues for future research in AI for clinical genetics and broader scientific applications.

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

*Ali Montazeralghaem,Guy Tennenholtz,Craig Boutilier,Ofer Meshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel two-stage training method inspired by diffusion models that teaches LLMs to ask effective sequential clarifying questions to elicit user preferences in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable conversational recommendation systems but struggle to effectively elicit user preferences with limited history. Generating sequential clarifying questions across domains remains challenging.

Method: Two-stage process: forward process generates questions and removes answers step-by-step (adding 'noise'), reverse process trains model to 'denoise' by learning to ask effective clarifying questions.

Result: Significant improvement in LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions and effectively eliciting user preferences.

Conclusion: The diffusion-inspired approach successfully trains LLMs to generate sequential clarifying questions that reveal user preferences, enhancing personalization in conversational recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace is a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into industrial CoPilot systems that provides interpretable insights for anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and intervention recommendations through causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern manufacturing needs interpretable AI systems that integrate prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning, as existing black-box AI lacks the transparency and trustworthiness required for high-stakes industrial environments.

Method: CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, supporting causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis with real-time operator interaction capabilities.

Result: In rocket assembly testing, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91) and strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92), scoring 4.59/5 in C3AN evaluation for robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: CausalTrace demonstrates precision and reliability for live deployment, providing transparent, explainable decision support that bridges the gap between AI predictions and practical industrial utility through neurosymbolic causal analysis.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

### [95] [Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047)
*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT is a framework that evaluates LLM-generated code for both functional correctness and contract adherence (handling ill-formed inputs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks like HumanEval+ and MBPP+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation benchmarks focus only on functional correctness with well-formed inputs, ignoring real-world software requirements to handle contract violations and reject ill-formed inputs.

Method: PACT extends HumanEval+ and MBPP+ with contract-violation test suites, analyzes code generation under different prompting conditions, and introduces novel metrics to quantify contract adherence.

Result: The framework demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly improves model performance in contract adherence compared to using contract descriptions alone.

Conclusion: PACT provides rigorous, interpretable metrics to evaluate code robustness in both functionality and contract adherence, revealing critical errors overlooked by conventional benchmarks.

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data to improve disaster response by providing semantic context and geographic awareness.


<details>

Motivation: Existing statistical approaches for disaster response lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. LLMs provide few-shot generalization but remain text-bound and blind to geography.

Method: GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals.

Result: Evaluation in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models shows that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes, bridging the gap between LLM capabilities and geographic awareness for improved disaster response.

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

*Sunzhu Li,Zhiyu Lin,Shuling Yang,Jiale Zhao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot is a training-free framework that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate think-prefixes that optimize Large Reasoning Models' reasoning behaviors, improving efficiency, safety, and instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning, and current training-free methods are limited to rigid heuristics or non-actionable analyses.

Method: Uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (cutting StrongREJECT score from 27.0% to 0.7), enhances instruction following, and synergizes with training-based methods.

Conclusion: Think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and different tasks prefer specific behavioral distributions, providing a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [98] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reinterprets AI agents as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems and proposes transductive learning as a foundational principle for learning to reason, emphasizing time reduction over reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI reasoning agents can be universal, how they learn to reason, and whether scaling model size or training data is sufficient for true intelligence.

Method: The authors reinterpret AI agents as stochastic dynamical systems and propose transductive learning, where the objective is to capture algorithmic structure from past data to reduce solution time for new tasks.

Result: The paper shows that optimal speed-up using past data is related to algorithmic information, derives the power-law scaling of inference time vs training time, and demonstrates that scaling model size alone can lead to savant-like behavior without true intelligence.

Conclusion: The key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, not just model size or accuracy, as time plays a critical role in learning that has been overlooked.

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

### [99] [HiCoTraj:Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12067)
*Junyi Xie,Yuankun Jiao,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj is a zero-shot framework that uses hierarchical chain-of-thought prompting with LLMs to infer demographic attributes from mobility patterns without labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility-based demographic inference methods rely on large labeled datasets, leading to poor interpretability and generalizability across datasets and user groups.

Method: Transforms trajectories into natural language representations (activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries), then uses hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning through three stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios on real-world trajectory data.

Conclusion: HiCoTraj addresses the scarcity of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains for demographic inference from mobility patterns.

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmboMatrix is a training ground infrastructure that enables LLMs to acquire embodied decision-making skills through simulation, interaction, and feedback, resulting in EmboBrain-7B outperforming much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack exposure to physical environments despite having general decision-making capabilities, limiting their true embodied understanding and preventing them from translating high-level goals into executable actions in the physical world.

Method: Created EmboMatrix training ground with multi-agent data engine for task/scene generation, distributed heterogeneous-hardware system for scalable simulation, and multi-level reward architecture for precise supervision. Used this to train EmboBrain LLM through extensive embodied interactions.

Result: EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1 baseline by 9.5% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance despite being much smaller.

Conclusion: Interactive, environment-grounded learning through training grounds like EmboMatrix is powerful for building truly intelligent embodied agents, enabling LLMs to acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills.

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

*Junyi Xie,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD is an unsupervised framework for detecting individual-level anomalies in human mobility by modeling personalized behavioral signatures and identifying deviations from normal patterns through semantic-enriched representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection focuses on trajectory-level analysis, but detecting individual-level anomalies within large populations remains challenging due to the need to identify unusual deviations relative to personal historical patterns.

Method: BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations integrating location meaning and temporal patterns, employs behavior-cluster-aware modeling to build personalized behavioral profiles, and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with semantic alignment.

Result: The framework enables detection of subtle behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines, and can identify individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets.

Conclusion: By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with randomness-related tasks like generating random numbers, passwords, and shuffling items, showing inconsistent performance that often deviates from expected random behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in applications requiring randomness (stochastic decision-making, gaming, cryptography), it's unclear how well they can handle random number generation and utilization.

Method: Conducted experiments testing LLMs on various randomness tasks, considering factors like external tool access, task types, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and prompting strategies. Tasks included random number generation, password creation, item shuffling, and randomness quality evaluation using entropy and NIST tests.

Result: LLMs can generate outputs with some randomness but performance is inconsistent and significantly deviates from expected random behavior across different tasks and conditions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in handling randomness effectively, highlighting the need for improvements in this area for reliable use in randomness-dependent applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneLife framework learns symbolic world models in complex stochastic environments using conditionally-activated programmatic laws within probabilistic programming, enabling efficient inference and handling sparse rule activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning world models in complex, stochastic environments where agents have only "one life" to explore without human guidance, moving beyond deterministic settings with abundant data.

Method: Uses conditionally-activated programmatic laws with precondition-effect structure in probabilistic programming, creating dynamic computation graphs that route inference only through relevant laws to handle complex hierarchical states.

Result: Outperforms strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios in Crafter-OO environment, successfully learns key dynamics from minimal unguided interaction, and demonstrates effective planning through simulated rollouts.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown complex environments, handling stochastic dynamics and sparse rule activation effectively.

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for precise attribute intensity control in LLMs, enabling generation of outputs with specific user-defined attribute intensities rather than just directional guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods only provide directional or open-ended guidance, failing to achieve exact attribute intensities needed for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations.

Method: Three key designs: (1) reformulating control as target-reaching problem, (2) training lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict attribute scores from partial generations, and (3) gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate toward specific targets.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini show the method can steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy, and demonstrates efficiency in preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation, and distillation of aligned behaviors.

Conclusion: The method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment and providing precise control for diverse applications.

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Method: Created a structured benchmark with fine-grained taxonomy, three-tier difficulty classification, multimodal reasoning through visual contexts, and evaluated various reasoning strategies (chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, self-correction).

Result: Even the best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieved under 80% accuracy on college-level materials science questions, with no single reasoning method consistently excelling across all scenarios.

Conclusion: MatSciBench provides a comprehensive benchmark that highlights the complexity of materials science reasoning and establishes a foundation for driving improvements in LLMs' scientific reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language

first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a

run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control

Result: Key findings include: distinction between core system and XAI explanation components; classification of evaluation metrics into affection, cognition, usability, interpretability, and explanation categories; and different design goals for AI novices (responsible use, acceptance, usability) vs data experts (performance, human-AI collaboration, task performance).

Conclusion: The study provides an extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks by incorporating human-centered perspectives and adapting design goals to users' AI expertise levels, offering practical guidance for XAI developers.

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

### [110] [GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12218)
*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT is a training framework that enables fine-tuning of LLM agents for goal-oriented API execution tasks without human annotation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with goal-oriented queries that require decomposing objectives into interdependent API calls, and smaller open-source models perform poorly compared to proprietary models like GPT-4.

Method: GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets from API documents and fine-tunes LLM agents to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses in a human annotation-free setting.

Result: GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple goal-oriented benchmarks and excel on the newly introduced GOATBench benchmark.

Conclusion: GOAT provides a practical approach for building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use without requiring human annotation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

### [111] [MedKGEval: A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi-Turn Evaluation Framework for Open-Ended Patient Interactions with Clinical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12224)
*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval is a multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs that uses knowledge graphs to simulate realistic patient interactions and provides in-situ turn-level assessment of model responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation methods in medical applications are inadequate for capturing the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of real clinical doctor-patient interactions, as they typically rely on post hoc review of full transcripts rather than assessing evolving informational needs.

Method: The framework uses: (1) knowledge graph-driven patient simulation with a control module retrieving medical facts from curated knowledge graphs; (2) in-situ turn-level evaluation by a Judge Agent assessing clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety; (3) comprehensive multi-turn benchmarking of LLMs with fine-grained metrics.

Result: MedKGEval successfully identifies subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks in eight state-of-the-art LLMs that conventional evaluation pipelines often overlook, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex clinical interaction dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust evaluation method for clinical LLMs that can be extended to multiple languages by switching knowledge graphs, offering better assessment of model performance in realistic medical dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

### [112] [PromptFlow: Training Prompts Like Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12246)
*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PromptFlow is a modular framework for automated prompt engineering that uses meta-learning and reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize prompts for LLMs, addressing limitations of manual and static automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic LLMs underperform on domain-specific tasks, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive, and current automated methods lack dynamic strategy selection and fine-grained prompt editing capabilities.

Method: Proposed PromptFlow framework with meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluator modules; uses gradient-based meta-learning and reinforcement learning to recycle experience and explore optimal prompt refinement trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow in optimizing prompts for LLMs.

Conclusion: PromptFlow provides an effective automated prompt engineering solution that requires minimal task-specific data and addresses key limitations of existing methods through dynamic optimization and experience recycling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

### [113] [$\mathbf{T^3}$: Reducing Belief Deviation in Reinforcement Learning for Active Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12264)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Jianxiang Wang,Haochen Yang,Mufei Li,James Cheng,Pan Li,Yu Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T^3 is a method that detects excessive belief deviation in LLM-based agents during active reasoning and truncates uninformative trajectory tails during training to improve policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents suffer from belief deviation - they struggle to maintain coherent problem state understanding, lose track of states, and fall into repetitive actions, which compounds errors and disrupts RL training.

Method: T^3 tracks belief deviation, detects when it becomes excessive, and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative tails while preserving credit for informative prefixes.

Result: Across 5 challenging tasks, T^3 improved training stability, token efficiency (25% reduction in rollout tokens), and final performance (up to 30% gains).

Conclusion: Belief control is a key principle for developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

### [114] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes tensor logic, a new programming language that unifies neural and symbolic AI by treating logical rules and Einstein summation as the same operation, enabling elegant implementation of various AI forms while enabling new capabilities like sound reasoning in embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development is hindered by inadequate programming languages - libraries like PyTorch/TensorFlow lack automated reasoning capabilities, while traditional AI languages like LISP/Prolog lack scalability and learning support, leading to inefficient hacky solutions.

Method: The paper introduces tensor logic as a fundamental unification of neural and symbolic AI, with tensor equations as the sole construct. This approach treats logical rules and Einstein summation as essentially the same operation, reducing all AI operations to tensor equations.

Result: Tensor logic enables elegant implementation of key AI forms including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines, and graphical models. Most importantly, it enables new capabilities like sound reasoning in embedding space.

Conclusion: Tensor logic combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, potentially serving as a basis for wider AI adoption by solving fundamental language limitations in current AI development.

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Zirui Guo,Xubin Ren,Lingrui Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything is a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities (text, images, tables, math) by treating multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents that contain rich combinations of text, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions.

Method: The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture cross-modal relationships and textual semantics, and develops cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching.

Result: RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly on long documents where traditional approaches fail.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

*Ayush Khaitan,Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM+CAS framework combines frontier LLMs with computer algebra systems to produce creative and symbolically verified proofs for asymptotic inequalities through an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the verification challenge in using LLMs for research mathematics, particularly for proving intricate asymptotic inequalities where domain decomposition is crucial but difficult.

Method: Uses an LLM to suggest domain decompositions and a CAS (like Mathematica) to verify each piece axiomatically in a feedback loop called In-Context Symbolic Feedback.

Result: The framework proves remarkably effective at proposing appropriate domain decompositions and answering Terence Tao's question about using LLMs with verifiers for asymptotic inequalities.

Conclusion: LLM+CAS demonstrates how AI can move beyond contest mathematics to become research-level tools for professional mathematicians, particularly in asymptotic analysis.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of "Vibe Coding" - a development paradigm where developers validate AI-generated code through outcome observation rather than line-by-line comprehension. The survey establishes theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this emerging approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the transformative potential of Vibe Coding with large language models, its effectiveness remains under-explored with empirical evidence showing unexpected productivity losses and challenges in human-AI collaboration.

Method: Systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers to survey the Vibe Coding ecosystem, formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process and synthesizing practices into five distinct development models.

Result: Established the first comprehensive taxonomy of Vibe Coding with five development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models.

Conclusion: Successful Vibe Coding depends not just on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic is the first benchmark testing LLMs' ability to automate tourism pricing with complex fare rules, revealing significant performance drops on difficult bundled-tour calculations despite general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Travel agencies want to use AI for error-prone pricing tasks, but deploying unreliable LLMs could cause financial losses and damage customer trust.

Method: Created a benchmark with 300 natural-language questions based on real booking requests from 42 pricing policies, with two difficulty levels: basic customer-type pricing and complex bundled-tour calculations with interacting discounts.

Result: LLMs show steep performance drops on harder bundled-tour calculations, exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs remain unreliable for revenue-critical applications without additional safeguards or domain adaptation, despite their general capabilities.

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

### [119] [MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423)
*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MTOS is a multi-topic opinion simulation framework that uses LLMs to model opinion dynamics across interrelated topics, addressing limitations of single-topic LLM approaches and traditional numerical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based studies focus on single topics and cannot capture cognitive transfer in multi-topic contexts, while traditional numerical models oversimplify linguistic attitudes and lack interpretability.

Method: MTOS integrates LLMs with short-term/long-term memory, multiple interaction mechanisms, dynamic topic-selection strategies, and belief decay to enable perspective updates across topics.

Result: Multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization: positive correlation amplifies echo chambers, negative correlation inhibits them, and irrelevant topics mitigate effects through resource competition. LLM agents realistically simulate opinion changes and improve interpretability.

Conclusion: MTOS successfully captures complex multi-topic opinion dynamics, with LLM-based agents providing more realistic simulations of human reasoning and improving system stability compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

*Chengyang Dong,Nan Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework with biased attention mechanism for autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections, using SAC algorithm and traffic risk predictor to improve safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high collision risks, requiring proactive safety control.

Method: Uses Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with biased attention mechanism to construct traffic risk predictor that assesses long-term collision risk and transforms it into dense reward signal.

Result: Simulation results show the method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at intersections in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed intelligent decision-making framework with biased attention mechanism proves effective for safe and efficient autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections.

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM judges show robustness to biased inputs but fine-tuning on biased data degrades performance; judgment scores correlate with task difficulty; four mitigation strategies proposed for fair AI judging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate judgment biases in LLM-as-a-judge models and ensure impartial evaluation in communication systems like customer support chatbots.

Method: Studied 11 types of biases in GPT-Judge and JudgeLM models under point-wise scoring, analyzed robustness to biased inputs, effects of scoring rubrics, impact of fine-tuning on biased data, and correlation with task difficulty.

Result: LLM judges are robust to biased inputs (assign lower scores), scoring rubrics enhance robustness, fine-tuning on biased data degrades performance, and judgment scores correlate with task difficulty (lower scores for harder tasks).

Conclusion: LLM judges demonstrate inherent robustness but require careful handling to prevent bias amplification; proposed four mitigation strategies for fair AI judging in practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A task-oriented dialogue framework using DAG-structured medical questions with cold-start mechanisms, adaptive branching, and automated report generation, showing high usability and low cognitive workload in clinical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient medical dialogue system that transforms clinical guidelines into structured interviews, reducing physician workload while maintaining clinical accuracy and workflow integration.

Method: DAG-structured question framework with hierarchical clustering for cold-start, expand-and-prune mechanism for adaptive branching, termination logic, and automated report synthesis. Evaluated using NASA-TLX, SUS, and QUIS with physicians.

Result: Patient app: NASA-TLX=15.6 (low workload), SUS=86 (high usability), QUIS=8.1/9. Physician app: NASA-TLX=26 (moderate workload), SUS=88.5 (excellent usability), QUIS=8.3/9. Both integrated well into clinical workflows.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces cognitive demand and supports efficient clinical interviews, though limited by system latency and small evaluation sample.

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface

### [123] [Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells: From Measurements to Decisions across Modality, Scale, Dynamics, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12498)
*Chengpeng Hu,Calvin Yu-Chian Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIVCs aim to model cell states from multimodal data, but face challenges in cross-lab transport, data leakage, and cross-scale coupling. A CSL framework with operator grammar is proposed for better evaluation and data design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIVC evaluations are limited to single datasets and settings, with poor transport across labs, data leakage issues, and inadequate handling of dose/time effects. Cross-scale coupling remains constrained.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective with operator grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention for dosing/scheduling. Emphasizes decision-aligned evaluation across modality, scale, context and intervention.

Result: Framework enables reproducible comparisons through operator-aware data design, leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration. Focuses on function-space readouts like pathway activity and clinical endpoints.

Conclusion: The CSL approach with operator grammar provides a systematic framework for developing more robust and clinically relevant AIVCs through improved evaluation standards and data design practices.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

*Utsav Kumar Nareti,Suraj Kumar,Soumya Pandey,Soumi Chattopadhyay,Chandranath Adak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex is a semi-interpretable framework for fine-grained multi-label text classification that uses dual-phase training with prototype discovery and classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance with human-aligned explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing prototype-based models that operate at coarse granularity and fail to handle multi-label text classification in real-world scenarios with overlapping and conflicting semantics.

Method: Employs dual-phase alternating training: unsupervised prototype discovery for semantically coherent prototypes, and supervised classification mapping prototypes to labels. Uses hierarchical loss for consistency across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels, with adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hotel review benchmark dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class), delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex establishes itself as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification, effectively capturing fine-grained insights with interpretable explanations.

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

### [125] [Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555)
*Andries Rosseau,Raphaël Avalos,Ann Nowé*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework using genetic similarity and inclusive fitness rewards that produces evolutionary social dynamics and strategic arms races.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model biological evolution's competitive and cooperative forces in AI agents, moving beyond binary team structures to enable more complex social dynamics.

Method: Assign genotypes to agents and use inclusive fitness-based reward functions that account for genetic sharing between agents, tested in prisoner's dilemma network games.

Result: Social dynamics align with biological principles like Hamilton's rule, with agents forming complex relationships (mutual cooperation between some pairs while adversarial between others).

Conclusion: Gene-based inclusive fitness provides a foundation for emergent strategic sophistication and social intelligence in multi-agent systems, enabling evolutionary autocurricula.

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

### [126] [HardcoreLogic: Challenging Large Reasoning Models with Long-tail Logic Puzzle Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12563)
*Jingcong Liang,Shijun Wan,Xuehai Wu,Siyuan Wang,Yitong Li,Qianglong Chen,Duyu Tang,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HardcoreLogic is a challenging benchmark of 5,000+ puzzles across 10 games that tests Large Reasoning Models' ability to handle non-canonical game variants through three transformations: Increased Complexity, Uncommon Elements, and Unsolvable Puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on canonical puzzle formats like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting and memorization that masks deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting to new variants.

Method: Systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP) to reduce reliance on shortcut memorization.

Result: Evaluations show significant performance drops even for top-performing models, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. Increased complexity is the dominant difficulty source, but models also struggle with subtle rule variations.

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic exposes limitations of current LRMs in genuine reasoning and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

### [127] [Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Jiangming Shu,Ye Ma,Xueyuan Lin,Shangxi Wu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Memory-as-Action, a framework where LLMs actively manage working memory through explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy, trained via a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Dynamic Context Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-horizon tasks due to limited memory being overwhelmed by irrelevant context, and existing memory management methods use external heuristics decoupled from the agent's core policy.

Method: Memory-as-Action framework treats memory management as learnable actions, with Dynamic Context Policy Optimization algorithm that handles trajectory fractures caused by memory editing by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and applying trajectory-level advantages.

Result: Joint optimization of task reasoning and memory management reduces computational consumption and improves task performance through adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's capabilities.

Conclusion: End-to-end learning of memory management as intrinsic capability enables more efficient and effective performance in long-horizon agentic tasks by allowing models to actively curate their working memory context.

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ERA is a two-stage framework that combines prior knowledge learning and online RL to create efficient embodied agents. It distills knowledge from trajectory-augmented, environment-anchored, and external knowledge priors, then uses specialized RL techniques to overcome training challenges. ERA-3B outperforms GPT-4o by 8.4% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% on EB-Manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between costly large-scale VLMs and underperforming smaller VLMs for embodied AI tasks, where current systems either require expensive deployment or lack necessary knowledge and skills.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Embodied Prior Learning distills knowledge from three data types (trajectory-augmented, environment-anchored, external knowledge), 2) Online RL pipeline with self-summarization, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization to address long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability.

Result: ERA-3B achieves 8.4% improvement on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% improvement on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen tasks and surpassing both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines.

Conclusion: ERA provides a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence with methodological insights for future embodied AI systems, showing that efficient smaller models can outperform larger ones through strategic knowledge distillation and specialized RL techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

*Tianyu Hu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Huaizhi Qu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-agent debate judge framework where LLMs collaboratively reason and iteratively refine responses, with mathematical formalization and stability detection for efficient stopping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-Judge approaches rely on simplistic aggregation methods like majority voting, which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers.

Method: Multi-agent debate framework with mathematical formalization of debate process, stability detection via time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture modeling, and adaptive stopping using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models show improved judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The debate framework amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles and provides an efficient solution for automated judgment tasks using LLMs.

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mattia Grasselli,Angelo Porrello,Carlo Augusto Grazia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAMNet uses Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) for vehicle trajectory prediction, showing promising results despite some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving faces safety challenges due to sensor limitations like obstructed field of view. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication via CAMs can enhance situational awareness when sensors are occluded.

Method: Designed and trained CAMNet neural network on motion forecasting dataset, then evaluated on a custom dataset created from CAM data to assess effectiveness.

Result: The approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can effectively support vehicle trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: CAMs show potential for trajectory prediction but have limitations that present opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves OOD detection without labeled data, thereby increasing AI system robustness through self-supervised learning and graph-theoretical techniques.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or

proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful

*Myles Foley,Sergio Maffeis,Muhammad Fakhrur Rozi,Takeshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLUTCH is a deep combinatorial bandit approach for JavaScript fuzzing that uses attention mechanisms and Concrete Dropout to intelligently select mutation targets, outperforming existing methods in coverage and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JavaScript fuzzing techniques use random mutation target selection, which is inefficient. The problem is suitable for combinatorial bandits with volatile arms due to the variable nature of JavaScript code.

Method: Proposes CLUTCH - a deep combinatorial bandit that observes variable-length JavaScript test cases using attention mechanisms, and dynamically adapts exploration using Concrete Dropout.

Result: CLUTCH increases valid test cases by 20.3% and coverage-per-testcase by 8.9% on average compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Achieves 78.1% less regret in volatile settings and 4.1% less regret in combinatorial settings.

Conclusion: CLUTCH demonstrates superior performance in JavaScript fuzzing by intelligently selecting mutation targets using combinatorial bandits and deep learning techniques, significantly improving efficiency and coverage.

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec enables real-time natural language control of recommender systems by using LLMs to simulate user preferences and training embedding models for efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users lack fine-grained controls to modify unsatisfactory recommendations from traditional recommender systems, and natural language requests via LLMs offer a solution.

Method: Train embedding models using LLM-simulated user approval judgments based on language requests, then integrate these predictions into standard recommender system signal weighting. At deployment, only requires one LLM embedding computation per request.

Result: Consistently enables fine-grained control across diverse requests on MovieLens dataset. User study with 19 Letterboxd users shows CTRL-Rec significantly enhances users' sense of control and satisfaction compared to traditional controls.

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec successfully provides real-time natural language control over recommendations while maintaining computational efficiency, improving user experience and satisfaction.

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Result: Competitive with state-of-the-art provers on public math benchmarks and largely outperforms them on new benchmarks in abstract algebra and quantum theory; successfully assisted an expert mathematician in formalizing a complex cryptography theorem.

Conclusion: The tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains, overcoming the generalization limitations of specialized systems.

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

TL;DR: This review paper analyzes the gap between laboratory demonstrations of mobile milli/microrobots and their clinical integration, proposing a Technology Readiness Level framework (mTRL) to accelerate translation to medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots have transformative potential for non-invasive medicine, but most remain confined to lab demonstrations with limited real-world feasibility. The field needs to bridge the gap between technical innovation and clinical application.

Method: The authors introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level framework (mTRL) that maps system development from conceptualization to clinical adoption through defined milestones and stepwise activities.

Result: The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of technological maturity, common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development.

Conclusion: Long-term impact depends on aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility, and integrating into clinical workflows. The mTRL framework supports this shift toward delivering meaningful patient outcomes through safer and more efficient interventions.

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

Result: Superior performance against state-of-the-art methods demonstrated through extensive experiments on public datasets.

Conclusion: The continuous semantic field approach provides effective landmark disambiguation and improves one-shot global localization performance with lightweight computational requirements.

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

*Akshay Naik,William R. Norris,Dustin Nottage,Ahmet Soylemezoglu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time path planning framework for off-road autonomous vehicles that combines terrain cost modeling with vehicle dynamics-aware planning for navigation in deformable and sloped terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-road autonomous vehicles need to plan curvature-feasible paths while accounting for varying soil strength and slope hazards in real-time, requiring robust terrain modeling and efficient planning algorithms.

Method: Combines Bekker pressure-sinkage model with elevation-derived slope penalties to create analytic terrain cost field, uses lattice-based planning with exact steering primitives (Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, bicycle arcs), and employs Vehicle-Dynamics RRT* for global exploration with Vehicle-Dynamics D* Lite for local repair.

Result: Enables millisecond-scale replanning without heuristic smoothing, demonstrated through hardware trials showing real-time navigation across soft soil and slope transitions on an off-road platform.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or learning-driven planning in deformable terrain, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

*Pin-Lun Chen,Chi-Hsi Kung,Che-Han Chang,Wei-Chen Chiu,Yi-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces controllable collision scenario generation for autonomous vehicle safety testing, proposing a framework that generates collision scenarios with specified collision types and time-to-accident parameters using a compact Collision Pattern representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical scenarios like collisions are rare and dangerous to collect in real-world autonomous vehicle testing, making simulated scenario generation essential for comprehensive safety evaluation.

Method: Proposes COLLIDE dataset from real-world driving logs and a framework that predicts Collision Pattern (spatial configuration at impact) before generating full adversarial trajectories to achieve specified collision types and TTA.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in collision rate and controllability, generates scenarios that induce higher planner failure rates, and enables fine-tuning planners for robustness improvements.

Conclusion: The controllable collision scenario generation framework effectively produces diverse safety-critical scenarios that can enhance autonomous vehicle planner robustness and contribute to safer deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that balance adaptability to diverse human behaviors with compliance to safety constraints.

Method: Integrates data-driven rewards learned from positive/negative demonstrations with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal reaching, using sampling-based lookahead controller and policy distillation.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations, with real-world demonstrations confirming practical deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances adaptability and safety in human environments, enabling practical real-time robot navigation with uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

*Fuhao Li,Wenxuan Song,Han Zhao,Jingbo Wang,Pengxiang Ding,Donglin Wang,Long Zeng,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Spatial Forcing (SF) is a novel alignment strategy that enhances vision-language-action models' spatial awareness by aligning intermediate visual embeddings with geometric representations from 3D foundation models, improving action precision without explicit 3D inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language-action models lack accurate spatial awareness because they're built on 2D pretrained models, hindering their ability to operate effectively in 3D physical environments. Existing approaches using explicit 3D inputs face challenges with sensor noise and hardware heterogeneity.

Method: SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations from pretrained 3D foundation models. This implicit alignment forces models to develop spatial comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators.

Result: SF achieves state-of-the-art results in simulation and real-world environments, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. It accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Spatial Forcing provides an effective solution for enhancing spatial awareness in VLAs without the limitations of explicit 3D inputs, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in robotic applications.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A shape-aware whole-body control framework for tendon-driven continuum robots that enables precise navigation in endoluminal surgery by combining physics-informed modeling with neural ODEs and model predictive control for tip tracking, obstacle avoidance, and shape conformance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoluminal procedures like bronchoscopy require precise navigation through complex anatomy where conventional tip-only control often causes wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to reach targets, necessitating safer and more effective control methods.

Method: Combines physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through Augmented Neural ODE for accurate shape estimation and Jacobian computation, uses sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to optimize tip tracking, backbone conformance, and obstacle avoidance, with task manager for real-time objective adjustment.

Result: Simulation studies show millimeter-level accuracy in trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on bronchoscopy phantom demonstrate improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework increases safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
safety-critical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoid robots to accurately step on positions they see in unknown spaces and emulate human walking, particularly for stair climbing tasks.

Conclusion: PolyMap provides an effective solution for humanoid robot stair climbing through real-time perception-based locomotion planning.

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,

using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual
odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a pretraining-finetuning paradigm for RL in robot motion control using a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) to warm-start actor-critic algorithms, achieving 40.1% better sample efficiency and 7.5% higher task performance compared to random initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL for robot motion control learns individual skills from scratch despite shared knowledge across task-specific policies for a single robot embodiment, wasting potential efficiency gains.

Method: 1) Task-agnostic exploration data collection 2) Train PIDM through supervised learning 3) Use pretrained weights to warm-start actor and critic networks in PPO algorithm

Result: Validated on 7 robot motion control tasks, showing 40.1% average improvement in sample efficiency and 7.5% average improvement in task performance compared to random initialization.

Conclusion: Pretraining neural networks with generalizable knowledge through PIDM provides significant benefits for RL in robot motion control, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

*Wenli Shi,Clemence Grislain,Olivier Sigaud,Mohamed Chetouani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating robot motions with controllable legibility levels, from highly legible to highly ambiguous, using an Information Potential Field and two-stage diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot motion prioritizes efficiency but lacks clear intent communication, while existing legible motion methods only produce single 'most legible' trajectories without context-aware expressiveness modulation.

Method: Proposes a modeling approach using Information Potential Field for continuous legibility scoring, combined with a two-stage diffusion framework that generates paths at specified legibility levels and converts them to executable robot actions.

Result: Experiments in 2D and 3D reaching tasks show the approach produces diverse, controllable motions with varying legibility levels while achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables continuous control over robot motion legibility, addressing the limitation of single-legibility approaches and supporting context-dependent intent expressiveness in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

*Junhyuk So,Chiwoong Lee,Shinyoung Lee,Jungseul Ok,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes two techniques - self-guidance and adaptive chunking - to enhance diffusion policies in Generative Behavior Cloning, addressing limitations of open-loop control like stochastic errors and delayed responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GBC methods using diffusion policies with open-loop control suffer from stochastic action sampling errors and delayed responses in dynamic environments, leading to unexpected task failures.

Method: Two novel techniques: (1) self-guidance that leverages past observations to improve action fidelity and promote future-aware behavior, and (2) adaptive chunking that selectively updates action sequences when reactivity benefits outweigh temporal consistency needs.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed self-guidance and adaptive chunking techniques effectively enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies in Generative Behavior Cloning.

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: The proposed M3D-skin tactile sensor provides an easy-to-fabricate, versatile solution for tactile sensing applications in robotics and human motion measurement.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

*Gaoyuan Liu,Joris de Winter,Kelly Merckaert,Denis Steckelmacher,Ann Nowe,Bram Vanderborght*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid RL planning framework for human-robot cooperation that combines interactive motion planning with RL task planning to balance safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In HRC environments, safety mechanisms often hinder task efficiency due to human interventions causing backup motions, goal failures, and frequent replanning that increases computational load.

Method: Uses a hybrid framework with RL task planner that selects safe/efficient task sequences based on motion planner feedback, and interactive motion planner that detects human arm motions and deploys collision-free paths.

Result: Validated on cobot in simulation and real world, showing ability to react to uncertain human motions at joint/task levels, reduce failed goal command repetitions, and decrease replanning requests compared to hard-coded methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances safety and efficiency in HRC by learning to avoid dangerous tasks while ensuring collision-free execution through motion planning.

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods significantly enhance robotic manipulator performance. The proposed workflow was successfully implemented on a real-world robot.

Conclusion: This work complements previous robotic pruning efforts and motivates future research in planning for pruning applications, addressing the critical manipulation planning challenges that were previously overlooked.

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stream network feature extraction and fusion strategy for vision-based tactile systems that separately extracts internal/external object features through 3D reconstruction and contact force measurement, then fuses them using weighted fusion to improve object recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based tactile sensors generate abundant redundant information and single-dimensional extraction lacks effective fusion, which hinders recognition accuracy improvement for object physical attributes.

Method: Two-stream network with distributed approach: one stream obtains depth map information through 3D reconstruction, another acquires hardness information by measuring contact force data. Features are extracted with CNN and then weighted fusion is applied.

Result: Force prediction error: 0.06 N (within 12 N range); Hardness recognition accuracy: 98.0%; Shape recognition accuracy: 93.75%; Object recognition accuracy with fusion: exceeds 98.5% in actual grasping scenarios.

Conclusion: This method enhances artificial tactile system's ability to transition from perception to cognition, enabling effective use in embodied perception applications for object physical attributes.

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise trajectory tracking at operational limits while handling actuator constraints, robustness to disturbances, and computational efficiency for safety-critical applications in high-speed agile quadrotor flight.

Method: Novel neural-augmented feedback controller that unifies strengths of existing control paradigms, with nonlinear feedback structure for computational efficiency and universal stability guarantees.

Conclusion: The controller successfully addresses limitations of existing paradigms, provides universal stability guarantees, enables direct real-world deployment without training augmentations, and demonstrates superior performance in aggressive trajectory tracking.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.

### [154] [Designing Tools with Control Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12630)
*Ajith Anil Meera,Abian Torres,Pablo Lanillos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for autonomous tool design that incorporates control confidence alongside performance optimization, inspired by prehistoric human tool-making practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous tool design frameworks focus only on performance optimization without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated applications, unlike prehistoric humans who designed tools considering both immediate accuracy and confidence for future use.

Method: The authors developed a task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design framework with a neuro-inspired control confidence term in the optimization routine, using CMAES-based evolutionary optimization strategy and rigorous simulations with a robotic arm.

Result: Tools designed with control confidence as an objective function showed higher robustness to environmental uncertainties during tool use compared to pure accuracy-driven objectives, and provided better balance between robustness and goal accuracy under control perturbations.

Conclusion: Incorporating control confidence into tool design optimization leads to more robust tools that perform better under uncertainty, and the CMAES-based evolutionary optimization strategy is more efficient than other state-of-the-art optimizers for this task.

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for human-robot logical interaction that enables robots to satisfy temporal logic tasks while collaborating with humans pursuing unknown tasks, using maximal adaptation and minimal tunable feedback to minimize interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable robot task completion while effectively collaborating with humans who have independent and unknown goals, balancing cooperation with minimal interference to human autonomy.

Method: Combines maximal adaptation (online strategy adjustment to exploit human behavior) and minimal tunable feedback (requesting human cooperation only when necessary) to guarantee task progress while minimizing interference.

Result: Validated in real-world block-manipulation with a Franka Emika Panda arm and Overcooked-AI benchmark, showing emergent cooperative behaviors beyond existing approaches while maintaining formal guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables rich cooperative human-robot interaction with minimal interference, preserving human autonomy while ensuring persistent robot task satisfaction even with conflicting human goals.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

TL;DR: A constrained reinforcement learning framework for autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators in lunar environments, achieving precise 6D pose tracking while ensuring safety constraints like collision avoidance and dynamic stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots offer superior mobility over wheeled rovers for navigating harsh lunar terrain, but need to operate autonomously while respecting critical safety constraints in space environments.

Method: Constrained reinforcement learning framework that integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation capabilities while explicitly addressing safety constraints including collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency.

Result: Achieved average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of 8.1 degrees for 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking, with consistent respect for both soft and hard constraints in lunar gravity conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges adaptive learning with mission-critical safety requirements, enabling advanced autonomous robotic explorers for future lunar missions.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

*Baicheng Li,Dong Wu,Zike Yan,Xinchen Liu,Zecui Zeng,Lusong Li,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reflective Self-Adaptation framework enables rapid autonomous task adaptation for VLA models through a dual-pathway approach combining failure-driven RL and success-driven SFT to prevent reward hacking and ensure task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained VLA models struggle with efficient in-situ adaptation to novel tasks, and traditional RL approaches suffer from low efficiency that hinders rapid task mastery.

Method: Dual-pathway architecture: (1) Failure-Driven Reflective RL uses VLM's causal reasoning to synthesize dense rewards from failure analysis, and (2) Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories with conditional curriculum for exploration.

Result: Experiments in challenging manipulation tasks show faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments without human intervention.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

*Se Hwan Jeon,Ho Jae Lee,Seungwoo Hong,Sangbae Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A GPU-parallelized residual architecture that tightly integrates MPC and RL at the torque-control level, combining MPC's interpretability with RL's adaptability for improved locomotion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC provides interpretable, tunable controllers but has robustness limitations due to model mismatch and computational constraints, while RL produces robust behaviors but lacks interpretability and suffers from out-of-distribution failures.

Method: Developed a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training, with a residual policy that learns targeted corrections to MPC outputs.

Result: Achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards, expands trackable velocity command range, and enables zero-shot adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain compared to standalone MPC or RL.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines the interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the adaptability of RL, using MPC as a strong prior to guide policy learning with simple rewards.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: The framework enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation and has potential to scale into a foundation model for dexterous grasping due to its high performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for

*Hang Yu,Julian Jordan,Julian Schmidt,Silvan Lindner,Alessandro Canevaro,Wilhelm Stork*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HYPE is a hybrid motion planner that integrates learned multimodal trajectory proposals into Monte Carlo Tree Search refinement, using ego-conditioned occupancy predictions for bidirectional interaction modeling and simplified cost function design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planners require complex cost functions to encode desired vehicle behavior across diverse urban scenarios, which is challenging to design. The paper aims to simplify cost function design while maintaining performance in complex multi-agent environments.

Method: Proposes HYPE framework that: 1) Uses learned multimodal trajectory proposals as heuristic priors, 2) Integrates proposals into MCTS refinement, 3) Introduces ego-conditioned occupancy prediction for bidirectional interaction modeling, 4) Simplifies cost function to minimal grid-based terms using proposal-driven guidance.

Result: Evaluations on nuPlan and DeepUrban benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, particularly in safety and adaptability metrics.

Conclusion: HYPE effectively addresses the challenge of complex cost function design in motion planning by leveraging learned trajectory proposals and ego-conditioned predictions, achieving strong performance in real-world urban driving scenarios.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.
