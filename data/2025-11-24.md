### [1] [The persistence of painting styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16695)
*Reetikaa Reddy Munnangi,Barbara Giunti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Persistent homology (PH) from topological data analysis can objectively differentiate artistic styles between artists, within the same artistic movement, and distinguish real art from AI-generated imitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional art style identification relies on subjective human expertise, but mathematical tools can provide objective analysis of artistic styles.

Method: Using persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method, to analyze artistic styles through structured mathematical approaches.

Result: PH can statistically differentiate between artists from different artistic currents, distinguish artists within the same movement, and identify AI-generated images mimicking an artist's style.

Conclusion: Persistent homology offers objective, interpretable insights for art analysis and can reliably distinguish genuine artistic works from AI-generated imitations.

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

*Takuya Igaue,Catia Correia-Caeiro,Akito Yoshida,Takako Miyabe-Nishiwaki,Ryusuke Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed method generates diverse macaque monkey facial expressions using StyleGAN2 with data augmentation, sample selection, and loss refinement to overcome limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating animal faces is challenging due to limited training data, especially for facial expressions across individuals. Macaque monkeys are important for neuroscience and evolutionary research.

Method: Used StyleGAN2 with three key improvements: 1) Data augmentation via motion transfer to animate still images, 2) Sample selection based on latent representations for uniform training data, 3) Loss function refinement for accurate eye movements.

Result: Method successfully generates diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained only on original still images. Also enables style-based image editing with specific parameters for facial movements.

Conclusion: Model effectively disentangles motion components as style parameters, providing valuable tool for macaque facial expression research in neuroscience and evolutionary studies.

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

### [4] [A Machine Learning-Driven Solution for Denoising Inertial Confinement Fusion Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16717)
*Asya Y. Akkus,Bradley T. Wolfe,Pinghan Chu,Chengkun Huang,Chris S. Campbell,Mariana Alvarado Alvarez,Petr Volegov,David Fittinghoff,Robert Reinovsky,Zhehui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised autoencoder with CDF 97 wavelet transform for denoising neutron images affected by mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods like BM3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron imaging is crucial for analyzing ICF events but suffers from mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise that degrades image quality and obscures fine details. Traditional filtering methods struggle with overlapping noise types, creating a need for better denoising techniques that preserve image fidelity.

Method: The authors implement an unsupervised autoencoder with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space specifically designed for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising in neutron imaging.

Result: The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data, demonstrating lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics compared to non-ML-based filtering methods like BM3D when benchmarked with forward model-generated data.

Conclusion: This approach represents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and enables better three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments, leveraging recent advances in synthetic data production for fusion imaging.

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

TL;DR: SAM 3 is a unified model for detecting, segmenting, and tracking objects using concept prompts (noun phrases or image exemplars), achieving double the accuracy of existing systems and improving on previous SAM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) by creating a model that can detect, segment, and track objects based on concept prompts in both images and videos, addressing limitations in existing systems.

Method: Built a scalable data engine producing a 4M unique concept dataset with hard negatives. Model consists of image-level detector and memory-based video tracker sharing a single backbone, with decoupled recognition and localization using a presence head.

Result: SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SAM 3 represents a significant advancement in promptable concept segmentation, with open-sourced model and new SA-Co benchmark for the research community.

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

### [6] [SafeR-CLIP: Mitigating NSFW Content in Vision-Language Models While Preserving Pre-Trained Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16743)
*Adeel Yousaf,Joseph Fioresi,James Beetham,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFeR-CLIP improves vision-language model safety by redirecting unsafe concepts to semantically close safe alternatives, minimizing representational disruption and recovering up to 8.0% zero-shot accuracy while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety fine-tuning methods for vision-language models like CLIP cause significant drops in generalization performance due to rigid alignment strategies that disrupt learned semantic structures.

Method: Proposed SaFeR-CLIP framework uses proximity-aware fine-tuning that redirects unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives, applying minimal intervention to preserve representational geometry.

Result: SaFeR-CLIP recovers up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. Also introduced NSFW-Caps benchmark with 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for rigorous safety evaluation under distributional shift.

Conclusion: Respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance in vision-language models.

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

### [7] [SVG360: Multi-View SVG Generation with Geometric and Color Consistency from a Single SVG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16766)
*Mengnan Jiang,Zhaolin Sun,Christian Franke,Michele Franco Adesso,Antonio Haas,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage framework that generates multi-view consistent SVGs from a single SVG input, achieving geometric and color consistency across views while reducing redundant paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are essential for modern design but generating multi-view consistent SVGs from single-view inputs remains underexplored, limiting applications in asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Lift rasterized input to 3D and render multi-view images, 2) Extend SAM2's temporal memory to spatial domain for part-level correspondences, 3) Perform path consolidation and structural optimization during raster-to-vector conversion.

Result: Generated SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduced redundant paths, and preserved fine structural details without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route for single-input, object-level multi-view SVG generation that supports applications like asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

### [8] [Mesh RAG: Retrieval Augmentation for Autoregressive Mesh Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16807)
*Xiatao Sun,Chen Liang,Qian Wang,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh RAG is a training-free framework that enhances autoregressive mesh generation by using retrieval-augmented generation with point cloud operations, enabling parallel inference, faster generation, and incremental editing without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual mesh creation is time-intensive, and current autoregressive methods suffer from quality-speed trade-offs due to sequential dependencies, making incremental editing difficult.

Method: Leverages point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components in a retrieval-based approach that decouples sequential dependencies.

Result: Significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential prediction, and enables incremental editing across various autoregressive mesh generation models.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG provides an effective plug-and-play solution that overcomes sequential limitations in autoregressive mesh generation, improving quality, speed, and editability without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

*Xizhe Xue,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REO-Instruct is the first unified benchmark for Earth Observation that combines descriptive tasks and scientific regression, specifically focusing on forest ecology with tasks ranging from human activity detection to above-ground biomass regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth Observation datasets focus mainly on semantic understanding tasks like captioning and classification, lacking benchmarks that connect multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables for scientific regression.

Method: Created REO-Instruct dataset integrating co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated through a hybrid human-AI pipeline, establishing a cognitive logic chain in forest ecology scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of generic VLMs shows they struggle with numeric reasoning tasks, revealing a key challenge for scientific VLMs in handling quantitative predictions alongside qualitative understanding.

Conclusion: REO-Instruct provides a standardized foundation for developing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference, bridging the gap between qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction in Earth Observation.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

*Vineet Bhat,Sungsu Kim,Valts Blukis,Greg Heinrich,Prashanth Krishnamurthy,Ramesh Karri,Stan Birchfield,Farshad Khorrami,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOP-ASK is a large-scale dataset for object interaction reasoning that addresses limitations in current VLMs' spatial understanding by providing fine-grained annotations for precise 3D localization, physical compatibility, affordances, and multi-step planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well on high-level spatial reasoning benchmarks but lack fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real-world applications, including precise 3D localization, physical compatibility, object affordances, and multi-step spatial planning.

Method: The authors created BOP-ASK using a data generation pipeline that leverages 6D object poses from BOP datasets, deriving fine-grained annotations including grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, and various spatial relationships. The dataset contains over 150k images and 33M QA pairs across six tasks.

Result: Models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and demonstrate emergent capabilities in precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. The dataset includes both in-distribution (BOP-ASK-core) and out-of-distribution (BOP-ASK-lab) benchmarks.

Conclusion: BOP-ASK provides a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating VLMs on fine-grained object interaction reasoning, addressing critical weaknesses in current spatial understanding capabilities and enabling testing of generalization through out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

### [12] [Parts-Mamba: Augmenting Joint Context with Part-Level Scanning for Occluded Human Skeleton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16860)
*Tianyi Shen,Huijuan Xu,Nilesh Ahuja,Omesh Tickoo,Philip Shin,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parts-Mamba is a hybrid GCN-Mamba model that improves skeleton action recognition under occlusion by capturing part-specific information and preserving distant joint context, achieving up to 12.9% accuracy improvement on NTU datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCN models perform poorly on imperfect skeletons with missing parts due to occlusions or poor communication quality, as they lack the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints.

Method: Proposed Parts-Mamba model combines GCN with Mamba architecture, featuring parts-specific scanning to capture part-specific information and a parts-body fusion module to preserve non-neighboring joint context.

Result: The model achieves up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings compared to existing GCN models.

Conclusion: The hybrid GCN-Mamba approach effectively addresses the limitation of missing local context in imperfect skeletons by better capturing and maintaining contextual information from distant joints.

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

*Aryan Tajmir Riahi,Khanh Dao Duc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) to extend GW distance for multiple-to-one and multiple-to-multiple object matching, showing superior performance in accuracy and efficiency for shape matching applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gromov-Wasserstein distance is limited to pairwise matching between single objects, which restricts its utility in scenarios requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching across various applications.

Method: The authors introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective that extends GW framework to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. They adapt traditional Optimal Transport algorithms with entropic regularization for point cloud representations.

Result: JGW provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces with point sampling convergence. Benchmarking shows superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other GW variants for partial matching.

Conclusion: The proposed JGW method effectively solves complex matching problems across diverse domains including computer graphics and structural biology, as demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets for multiple shape matching of geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

### [14] [Align & Invert: Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion and Flow-based Models via Representational Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16870)
*Loukas Sfountouris,Giannis Daras,Paris Giampouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REPA (representation alignment) improves inverse problem solving by aligning diffusion/flow model representations with pretrained self-supervised encoders like DINOv2, enhancing reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend representation alignment from generative modeling to inverse problems, leveraging pretrained generative models as priors to improve reconstruction fidelity when ground-truth signals are unavailable.

Method: Apply REPA between diffusion/flow models and pretrained self-supervised visual encoders (e.g., DINOv2) to guide reconstruction at inference time, using approximate target features for alignment.

Result: Substantial improvement in reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism across super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring tasks, with efficiency gains from reduced discretization steps.

Conclusion: REPA provides a powerful regularization for inverse problems that consistently enhances reconstruction quality while maintaining solver performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

TL;DR: NFGlassNet: A novel glass surface detection method using flash/no-flash image pairs that exploits reflection dynamics for accurate localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass surfaces are challenging to detect due to their transparent nature. Existing methods rely on boundary or reflection cues but fail to fully exploit intrinsic glass properties. The authors observed that illumination differences across glass surfaces create predictable reflection patterns in flash/no-flash scenarios.

Method: Proposed NFGlassNet with two key modules: Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing reflection and glass surface features. Built a dataset of 3.3K flash/no-flash image pairs with ground truth annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art glass surface detection methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging reflection dynamics in flash/no-flash imagery provides an effective approach for glass surface detection, addressing limitations of existing methods that don't fully utilize intrinsic glass properties.

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

TL;DR: R-AVST is the first dataset for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning with 5K videos and 27K objects across 100 event types. AVST-Zero is a reinforcement learning model that achieves competitive performance on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs focus on simple video scenarios, failing to capture the complexity of real-world audio-visual events, creating a need for more sophisticated datasets and models.

Method: Created R-AVST dataset using LLM-based object extraction, automatic spatial annotation, and manual inspection. Proposed AVST-Zero model using reinforcement learning with multi-dimensional rewards without intermediate supervision.

Conclusion: R-AVST advances audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero provides a novel approach for future challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

### [17] [Warm Diffusion: Recipe for Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16904)
*Hao-Chien Hsueh,Chi-En Yen,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Warm Diffusion proposes a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of hot diffusion (noise-based) and cold diffusion (blur-based) by jointly controlling blurring and noise processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hot diffusion fails to exploit image correlations between high-frequency detail and low-frequency structures, while cold diffusion neglects the role of noise in shaping the data manifold, leading to out-of-manifold issues.

Method: A divide-and-conquer strategy that exploits spectral dependency in images, disentangling denoising and deblurring processes. Uses Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) analysis to balance model learning dynamics and data manifold changes.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the approach for image generation.

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion successfully integrates both noise and blurring paradigms, providing a unified framework that addresses limitations of existing diffusion methods.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality assessment methods provide only single scores, which are too coarse for targeted guidance in improving generative models. Fine-grained evaluation along realism and plausibility dimensions is crucial for model optimization.

Method: Created Q-Real dataset with 3,088 AI-generated images annotated with entity locations, judgment questions, and attribution descriptions. Built Q-Real Bench to evaluate MLLMs on judgment and grounding tasks, and designed a fine-tuning framework for MLLMs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of the dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. The dataset enables effective evaluation and improvement of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Q-Real provides a comprehensive framework for fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, addressing the limitations of coarse single-score assessments and enabling targeted model optimization through detailed realism and plausibility analysis.

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniModel is a unified generative model that handles both visual understanding and generation through a pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework, treating all inputs and outputs as RGB pixels in a shared visual space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve unification across models, tasks, and representations by eliminating modality discrepancies and creating a fully vision-native multimodal learning approach.

Method: Uses a Unified Diffusion Transformer with rectified flow in pixel space, mapping text to painted text images and treating all tasks as pixel-to-pixel transformations in visual space.

Result: Demonstrates strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability, enabling cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops in both text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

*Chaoran Xu,Chengkan Lv,Qiyu Chen,Yunkang Cao,Feng Zhang,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeltaDeno is a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that uses diffusion model contrast with minimal prompts to localize and edit defects without needing real anomaly samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly generation methods require few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity of anomalies and tends to overfit category priors.

Method: Contrasts two diffusion branches driven by minimal prompt pairs under shared schedule, accumulates denoising deltas into localization maps, uses latent inpainting with token-level prompt refinement and spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens.

Result: Achieves great generation quality, realism, and consistent gains in downstream detection performance on public datasets.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno provides an effective training-free approach for anomaly generation that works without real anomaly samples or training, addressing the fundamental scarcity problem in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: DGAF-VSR is a diffusion model-based video super-resolution method that improves alignment and compensation between frames using feature domain processing and upscaled warping to enhance perceptual quality, fidelity, and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DM-based VSR methods suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and trade-offs between perceptual quality and fidelity due to inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames.

Method: Proposes DGAF-VSR with Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in aligned features and Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) for dense guidance in feature domain, leveraging feature domain compensation and upscaled resolution warping.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 35.82% DISTS reduction in perceptual quality, 0.20 dB PSNR gain in fidelity, and 30.37% tLPIPS reduction in temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Feature domain compensation and upscaled resolution warping are crucial for overcoming limitations in DM-based VSR, enabling superior performance in perceptual quality, fidelity, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

TL;DR: OmniGround is a comprehensive benchmark for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding with 3,475 videos across 81 categories and complex queries. The paper introduces PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework that decomposes STVG into temporal grounding and spatio-temporal propagation, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STVG models have limitations due to narrow benchmark scope, leading to category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. Real-world applications require handling diverse objects and complex queries that existing benchmarks don't adequately address.

Method: Proposed Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline combining multi-directional tracking with error correction. Introduced DeepSTG evaluation framework for comprehensive dataset quality assessment. Developed PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework that decomposes STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation.

Result: Performance drops 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, especially with small/occluded objects and complex spatial relations. PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on OmniGround, with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The OmniGround benchmark addresses limitations of existing datasets and reveals significant performance gaps in complex scenarios. PG-TAF provides an effective solution that substantially improves STVG performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeCLIP improves open-set domain generalization by using semantic-enhanced vision-language alignment, duplex contrastive learning, and semantic-guided diffusion to better handle hard unknown classes that resemble known categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the dilemma between known-class structural risk and unknown-class open-space risk, particularly for 'hard unknowns' that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes, leading to over-confidence issues.

Method: Proposes Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) with: 1) semantic-aware prompt enhancement to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, 2) duplex contrastive learning with repulsion (separability from known classes) and cohesion (semantic proximity), and 3) semantic-guided diffusion to synthesize pseudo-unknowns by perturbing semantic tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SeeCLIP effectively addresses the open-set domain generalization challenge by leveraging fine-grained semantic enhancement to create more robust decision boundaries against hard unknown classes.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks are insufficient for modern VLMs as they only evaluate privacy perception, failing to address the critical risk of privacy reasoning - VLMs' ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles.

Method: Proposed MultiPriv benchmark with Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR) framework, using a bilingual multimodal dataset with synthetic individual profiles where identifiers are linked to sensitive attributes, enabling 9 challenging tasks across the PPR spectrum.

Result: Evaluation of 50+ VLMs reveals: (1) significant unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks, (2) perception metrics poorly predict reasoning risks, (3) existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against reasoning-based attacks.

Conclusion: MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving models by addressing the critical gap in privacy reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

Motivation: To develop an effective face de-identification method that can suppress identity while preserving other facial attributes, inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry.

Method: Reinterprets identity editing as semantic displacement in latent h-space of pretrained diffusion models. Uses optimization with novel reagent losses for attribute preservation and identity suppression, with both linear and geodesic editing schemes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art de-identification methods on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets, achieving superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: FLUID provides an effective training-free framework for face de-identification that successfully balances identity removal with attribute preservation through latent space manipulation.

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: A novel implicit neural representation framework that jointly models dynamic MRI images and optical flow using physics-inspired regularization, enabling simultaneous high-quality reconstruction and motion estimation without pre-estimated flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional motion-compensated MRI reconstructions rely on inaccurate pre-estimated optical flow under undersampling conditions, which degrades reconstruction quality and temporal fidelity.

Method: Uses two implicit neural representations - one for spatiotemporal image content and another for optical flow, coupled via optical flow equation as physics regularization, with data consistency loss for k-space measurements.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning methods on cardiac MRI datasets, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: Implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints shows strong potential for advancing dynamic MRI reconstruction by simultaneously recovering images and motion fields.

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens blur compositing methods rely on camera parameters and scene depth information that are often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting accessibility and generalizability of realistic mixed reality compositions.

Method: Proposes estimating circle of confusion (CoC) maps directly from RGB images, infers CoC values for virtual objects using linear relationship between signed CoC maps and depth, and renders realistic lens blur using a neural reblurring network.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible and practical solution for real-world mixed reality applications by eliminating the need for camera metadata or depth information while maintaining realistic lens blur effects.

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: FingerCap introduces finger-level hand motion captioning with a 40K dataset and FiGOP method that combines RGB keyframes with hand keypoints to capture fine finger motions, overcoming temporal sparsity limitations in Video-MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication, but current methods struggle with capturing detailed finger-level semantics.

Method: Proposes FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures) which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe, using a lightweight temporal encoder to convert keypoints into motion embeddings integrated with RGB features.

Result: Experiments show strong Video-MLLMs struggle with finger-level reasoning, while FiGOP-augmented models achieve consistent gains under both automated HandJudge evaluation and human studies.

Conclusion: FiGOP effectively recovers fine temporal cues for finger motion captioning without increasing RGB density, providing a compute-friendly solution to temporal sparsity in video understanding.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense 3D reconstruction methods face challenges with drift and redundant point maps when integrated into SLAM, limiting efficiency and downstream applications like novel view synthesis.

Method: Builds locally consistent submaps through lightweight tracking/reconstruction, then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency and provides feedback to correct local drift.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering with over 12% improvement in tracking, producing finer geometry while maintaining compact memory-efficient representation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SING3R-SLAM provides an efficient and versatile 3D mapping solution that addresses drift and redundancy issues through its globally consistent Gaussian representation, enabling better performance across multiple downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis. To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

### [32] [Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting with Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16952)
*Yicheng Deng,Hideaki Hayashi,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a point-supervised facial expression spotting framework that uses single timestamp annotations instead of full temporal boundaries, featuring Gaussian-based intensity modeling and a two-branch approach for expression detection and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial expression spotting methods require costly temporal boundary annotations, which are time-consuming to obtain. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach using only point supervision (single timestamp per instance) to reduce annotation burden.

Method: Proposes a two-branch framework: 1) Class-agnostic expression intensity branch with Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) for soft pseudo-labeling, and 2) Class-aware apex classification branch for macro/micro-expression classification. Also includes intensity-aware contrastive loss for feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facial expression spotting using point supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed point-supervised framework successfully addresses the annotation burden in facial expression spotting by using single timestamp annotations and achieves competitive performance through Gaussian-based intensity modeling and two-branch architecture.

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

### [33] [OmniPT: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Language Models for Pedestrian Tracking and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17053)
*Teng Fu,Mengyang Zhao,Ke Niu,Kaixin Peng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniPT is a unified pedestrian tracking framework using LVLMs that can track pedestrians, track based on reference, and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel at semantic understanding but show performance gaps in instance-level tasks like pedestrian tracking compared to expert models. New tasks like Referring MOT and Semantic MOT require advanced semantic understanding, which LVLMs are well-suited for.

Method: A three-phase training approach: RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. First RL phase enables bounding box format output, mid-training with pedestrian datasets, supervised fine-tuning on tracking datasets, and final RL phase to improve tracking and instruction following.

Result: Experimental results on tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than previous methods.

Conclusion: OmniPT successfully bridges the gap between LVLMs and instance-level pedestrian tracking tasks, achieving superior performance through a carefully designed training pipeline that leverages LVLMs' semantic understanding capabilities.

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QueryOcc is a self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy using 4D spatio-temporal queries, outperforming previous methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU while running at 11.6 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of expensive 3D annotation and existing approaches that rely on 2D rendering consistency or discretized voxel grids, which limit spatial precision and scalability.

Method: Uses independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames with a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while compressing distant regions. Supports supervision from pseudo-point clouds or raw lidar data.

Result: Achieves 26% improvement in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while maintaining real-time performance at 11.6 FPS.

Conclusion: Direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning, demonstrating superior performance over previous camera-based methods.

Abstract: Learning 3D scene geometry and semantics from images is a core challenge in computer vision and a key capability for autonomous driving. Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neighbor GRPO is a novel alignment algorithm for flow matching models that bypasses SDE conversion by perturbing initial noise conditions and using distance-based optimization, offering better efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers than SDE-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDE-based GRPO methods for flow matching models suffer from inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Neighbor GRPO which generates diverse trajectories by perturbing initial noise conditions of ODEs and optimizes using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy, with symmetric anchor sampling and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting.

Result: Significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality while preserving deterministic ODE sampling advantages.

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO provides an effective alternative to SDE-based alignment methods that maintains efficiency and solver compatibility while improving performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

*Junming Liu,Yifei Sun,Weihua Cheng,Yujin Kang,Yirong Chen,Ding Wang,Guosun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReBrain is a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework that synthesizes brain MRI from sparse CT scans using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model and retrieval guidance from similar CT slices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is crucial for brain disease diagnosis but not always feasible, and sparse low-dose CT scans make accurate MRI reconstruction challenging.

Method: Uses BBDM to synthesize MRI slices from 3D CT, retrieves similar CT slices from database via fine-tuned model, incorporates references through ControlNet for structural continuity, and applies spherical linear interpolation for rare retrieval failures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS datasets.

Conclusion: ReBrain effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing MRI from sparse CT scans through retrieval-augmented diffusion framework.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatPedia is a foundation model for PBR materials that uses a joint RGB-PBR representation to unify material generation tasks, achieving superior quality and diversity in 1024×1024 synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PBR material creation is labor-intensive and specialized, with existing generative methods lacking unified representations that bridge natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented pipelines.

Method: Developed a novel joint RGB-PBR representation encoding materials into two interdependent latents (RGB appearance and four PBR maps), formulated as a 5-frame sequence using video diffusion architectures to capture correlations and transfer RGB generation priors.

Result: MatPedia achieves native 1024×1024 synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity, trained on MatHybrid-410K dataset combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images.

Conclusion: The joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks (text-to-material, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition) within a single architecture, overcoming limitations of task-specific pipelines.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR modeling uses spanning tree traversal orders to maintain sampling performance while enabling flexible sequence orders for image editing, overcoming limitations of random permutations in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between sampling performance and sequence order flexibility in autoregressive image generation, where random permutations either degrade performance or limit editing capabilities.

Method: Uses traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled from image patch lattices, obtained through breadth-first search and rejection sampling to ensure connected partial observations appear as sequence prefixes.

Result: Preserves postfix completion capability while maintaining sampling performance without significant architecture changes to conventional autoregressive models.

Conclusion: STAR provides a structured randomized strategy that balances performance and flexibility for image editing applications in autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

TL;DR: Proposes a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network for blind super-resolution that predicts unsupervised blur and noise embeddings to handle unknown degradations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods perform well with known fixed degradations like bicubic downsampling but suffer significant performance drops when actual degradation deviates from assumptions, highlighting the need for robust blind SR approaches.

Method: Uses a dual branch network to extract two unsupervised degradation embeddings representing blurry and noisy information, treats the degradation extractor as a regularizer leveraging differences between SR and HR images, and adapts SR network to blur and noise embeddings separately.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in blind super-resolution problems.

Conclusion: The proposed dual branch degradation extraction approach effectively handles unknown degradations in blind SR by separately modeling blur and noise components, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Conclusion: DMG-YOLO effectively addresses the challenges of real-time small object detection in remote sensing imagery by achieving a good balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency through its novel architecture design.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables realistic food image synthesis on edge devices with user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets, achieving superior performance through domain-specific culinary metrics.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a comprehensive intervention framework targeting hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by analyzing and intervening on multiple causal pathways (image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, text-to-text) in transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite impressive performance, LVLMs remain prone to hallucination, and existing approaches don't fully address the multi-pathway nature of hallucination causes in transformer architectures.

Method: Proposes intervention framework aligned with transformer's causal architecture, identifies critical hallucination heads in different pathways, and develops tailored interventions for discriminative and generative question-answer formats.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent reduction in hallucinations across diverse alignment types, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pathway-specific intervention approach.

Conclusion: Hallucinations in LVLMs arise from interplay among multiple causal pathways, and targeted interventions on critical heads within each pathway can effectively reduce hallucinations when tailored to different question-answer formats.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

Method: Models survival pressure as regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing optimization gradients to autonomously determine Gaussian retention/pruning. Introduces opacity decay with finite opacity prior to accelerate selection.

Result: Achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15% budgets compared to 3DGS, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS.

Conclusion: The proposed fully learnable pruning framework effectively reduces 3DGS complexity while maintaining high rendering quality, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

*Suchetan G. Uppur,Hemant Kumar,Vaibhav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating synthetic LiDAR point clouds by editing real-world scans using semantic mask guidance and diffusion-based generation in 2D range view space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training autonomous driving systems rely on handcrafted 3D virtual environments which are time-consuming, expensive, and fail to capture real-world complexity, especially for edge cases.

Method: Transform LiDAR point clouds to 2D range view images, use semantic masks with convex hull-based guidance to provide object dimensions/orientations/locations, and apply diffusion-based generation for semantic editing.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, validated on KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: Provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data to improve autonomous driving system robustness.

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

*Sai Nath Chowdary Medikonduru,Hongpeng Jin,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to improve plant disease detection from leaf images by better measuring ensemble diversity and selecting optimal ensemble members.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant diseases cause massive economic losses ($220B annually) and threaten food security. Current ensemble diversity metrics fail to identify optimal ensemble teams for plant disease detection.

Method: 1) Analyze limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (Q metrics), 2) Propose novel SQ metric that captures synergy between ensemble members, 3) Validate SQ approach through experiments on plant leaf image dataset.

Result: The SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy compared to existing diversity metrics.

Conclusion: The SQ framework enables more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection by better capturing ensemble member synergy.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RadioKMoE, a knowledge-guided radiomap estimation framework combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve accuracy and robustness in complex wireless environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex radio propagation behavior and challenging environments make accurate radiomap estimation difficult, requiring better methods that can handle both global patterns and local details.

Method: Uses KAN module to predict initial coarse coverage map leveraging physics approximation capabilities, then employs MoE network with specialized expert networks for precise estimation using environmental information and initial map.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced accuracy and robustness in both multi- and single-band radiomap estimation compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: RadioKMoE framework effectively integrates knowledge guidance with specialized expert networks to achieve superior radiomap estimation performance in complex wireless scenarios.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses cultural inconsistency in multilingual text-to-image models by identifying culture-sensitive neurons and proposing two alignment strategies to improve cultural consistency without compromising visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual T2I models produce culturally neutral or English-biased results due to insufficient activation of culture-related representations, despite having the necessary cultural knowledge.

Method: Proposed a probing method to localize culture-sensitive neurons, then introduced two strategies: inference-time cultural activation (amplifying identified neurons) and layer-targeted cultural enhancement (updating only culturally relevant layers).

Result: Experiments on CultureBench showed consistent improvements in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses cultural bias in multilingual T2I models by targeting specific culture-sensitive neurons and layers, achieving better cultural alignment without extensive model retraining.

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DReX is a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised DINOv3 and supervised ResNet-50 features to predict image complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance without using language data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether language information is necessary for visual complexity prediction and explore if vision-only models can achieve human-aligned complexity perception.

Method: Fuses multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16 through a learnable attention mechanism to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure.

Result: Achieves SOTA on IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing multimodal methods while using 21.5x fewer parameters. Generalizes well across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: Visual features alone are sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction, and properly fused self-supervised transformers and supervised CNNs offer complementary benefits for this task.

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuM extends masked autoencoding to multiple views of the same scene for 3D vision, outperforming DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on geometric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods focus on semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. The authors aim to learn features specifically tailored for 3D vision tasks.

Method: Extends MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene by uniformly masking all views and using a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching, and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed MuM approach provides a simpler and more scalable method for learning geometric representations compared to previous methods like CroCo.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

*Junhong Min,Jimin Kim,Cheol-Hui Min,Minwook Kim,Youngpil Jeon,Minyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFocus is a steerable Vision Transformer that enables intent-driven stereo depth estimation, allowing users to specify desired depth focus rather than just estimating static depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation models are passive and only estimate depth to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive desired depths in complex scenes with transmissive materials.

Method: A steerable Vision Transformer conditioned on a scalar depth preference that dynamically adapts computation to focus on intended depth, trained on a new 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset capturing see-through effects.

Result: Achieves SOTA on conventional benchmarks (BOOSTER), demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on new multi-depth datasets, and shows strong generalization to unseen see-through scenes.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward active, human-like 3D perception by enabling selective depth perception in complex scenes with transmissive materials.

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

TL;DR: MVLR is a unified model that restores images from various weather degradations using a Visual-Language Model for weather priors and an Implicit Memory Bank for degradation patterns, achieving superior performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions (rain, haze, snow) is crucial for autonomous driving and outdoor robots but remains challenging.

Method: Combines lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with VLM for chain-of-thought weather degradation encoding and IMB for storing degradation patterns. VLM-generated priors query IMB to retrieve fine-grained prototypes, which are fused with visual features via dynamic cross-attention.

Result: Outperforms single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines on four severe-weather benchmarks in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: MVLR provides a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness suitable for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

Result: Created DIF-V dataset with 27,780 images across 926 identities; analysis revealed existing verification models exhibit gender and racial biases, and identity style modifications negatively impact model performance.

Conclusion: Addressing dataset inequities through diverse synthetic data enriches AI diversity/ethics discussions and provides foundation for more inclusive, reliable face verification technologies.

Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConfusedTourist, a cultural adversarial robustness suite that tests Vision-Language Models' stability against perturbed geographical cues, revealing significant accuracy drops when multiple cultural concepts coexist in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations focus on single cultural concepts per image, overlooking real-world scenarios where multiple cultural cues coexist, which is crucial for supporting diverse multicultural societies.

Method: Developed ConfusedTourist benchmark with image-stacking perturbations and image-generation-based variants to test VLMs' cultural robustness against mixed cultural concepts.

Result: Experiments show critical vulnerabilities - accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and worsens with image-generation variants. Interpretability analyses reveal systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues.

Conclusion: Visual cultural concept mixing substantially impairs even state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding systems.

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: MoE-ViT is a Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer that addresses computational bottlenecks in multi-channel image processing by treating channels as experts and using a lightweight router to select only relevant channels for attention, achieving efficiency gains without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers face computational bottlenecks when processing multi-channel images due to quadratic growth in attention from channel-wise comparisons, leading to excessive FLOPs and high training costs.

Method: Propose MoE-ViT architecture that treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention, inspired by Sparse Mixture-of-Experts philosophy.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments on JUMP-CP and So2Sat datasets show substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance, and in some cases enhanced performance.

Conclusion: MoE-ViT provides a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging by solving the efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention while maintaining or improving model performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework using teacher networks fine-tuned on small task-relevant datasets to mitigate shortcut learning in medical image analysis, achieving comparable performance to bias-free models even on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often learn shortcut solutions using spurious correlations, which can lead to poor robustness and patient harm by preventing models from using clinically meaningful features.

Method: Proposed knowledge distillation framework leveraging teacher networks fine-tuned on small subsets of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in student networks trained on large biased datasets. Different shortcut types (diffuse vs localized) are targeted through intermediate layer strategies.

Result: Consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches across CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, 3D CNNs). Achieved comparable performance to bias-free models even on out-of-distribution test data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practical applicability for real-world medical imaging where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify beforehand, enabling robust performance without extensive bias labeling.

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

Result: REMSA outperforms naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs on a benchmark of 75 expert-verified query scenarios (900 configurations). It operates entirely on public metadata without accessing private data.

Conclusion: RS-FMD and REMSA provide effective solutions for automated remote sensing foundation model selection, addressing the challenge of model selection in this domain through structured databases and intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

TL;DR: SketchVerify is a training-free framework that improves video generation by planning better motion trajectories through a test-time sampling and verification loop, using lightweight video sketches to evaluate candidate motions before final synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods use single-shot motion plans limited to simple motions or iterative refinement requiring multiple expensive diffusion calls, leading to poor motion quality and high computational cost.

Method: Predicts multiple candidate motion plans, renders them as lightweight video sketches over static backgrounds, verifies them using a vision-language model for semantic alignment and physical plausibility, and iteratively refines until finding satisfactory trajectories.

Result: Significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench benchmarks while being substantially more efficient than competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The sketch-verification approach effectively enhances motion planning quality for video generation, with performance scaling consistently as more trajectory candidates are evaluated.

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable painless creation of realistic 3D indoor scenes using only short text inputs, eliminating the need for manual layout design or panoramic image guidance.

Method: Uses hierarchical language-driven agent planners to parse ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions, initializes 3D point clouds, implements arrangement constraints for collision-free layouts, and employs AnyReach Sampling and Interval Timestep Flow Sampling for efficient rendering.

Result: Generates geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes in under 30 minutes, surpassing prior approaches in rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability.

Conclusion: RoomPlanner demonstrates effective automatic 3D room generation from text, achieving high-quality results with improved efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

*Jingyun Chen,Linghan Cai,Zhikang Wang,Yi Huang,Songhan Jiang,Shenjin Huang,Hongpeng Wang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathAgent is a training-free LLM-based agent framework that emulates pathologists' stepwise reasoning process for analyzing whole-slide images, providing interpretable predictions through explicit chain-of-thought trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational pipelines for whole-slide image analysis lack explicit reasoning trajectories, resulting in opaque and unjustifiable predictions, unlike human pathologists' iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process.

Method: PathAgent uses three modules: Navigator for iterative micro-region localization, Perceptor for morphology visual cue extraction, and Executor for integrating findings into natural language trajectories, forming an explicit chain-of-thought.

Result: PathAgent demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across five datasets, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks, and shows promise as a transparent diagnostic assistant in human pathologist evaluations.

Conclusion: PathAgent successfully bridges the gap between computational pipelines and human expert reasoning by providing fully interpretable predictions through explicit reasoning trajectories, showing strong potential as a clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

*Bhanu Pratap Paregi,Vaibhav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-AD-Net is a reinforcement learning refinement framework that improves point cloud completion quality by adjusting global feature vectors in latent space and selecting the best reconstruction through geometric consistency evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models generate globally plausible shapes but often suffer from local geometric inconsistencies, requiring a refinement approach to improve geometric fidelity.

Method: Uses RL in latent space of pretrained point autoencoder to adjust global feature vectors, with PointNN selector evaluating geometric consistency to choose between original and refined outputs. Trained per category with Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics.

Result: Consistently improves completion quality across both training-style and random cropping scenarios on ShapeNetCore-2048, outperforming baseline completion networks.

Conclusion: RL-AD-Net provides effective, lightweight, and model-agnostic refinement that enhances geometric consistency in point cloud completion without requiring retraining of base models.

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REArtGS++ improves articulated object reconstruction by modeling decoupled screw motion without joint type priors, using planar Gaussian splatting with temporal geometry constraints for better generalization to complex objects like screw-joints and multi-part assemblies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like REArtGS struggle with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lack geometric constraints for unseen states, limiting their generalizability in articulated object reconstruction.

Method: Models decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, jointly optimizes part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending, and introduces temporal geometry constraints using planar Gaussians with temporally consistent regularization through Taylor first-order expansion.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate superior performance in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: REArtGS++ provides a more generalizable approach for articulated object reconstruction by addressing limitations in handling complex joint types and incorporating temporal geometric constraints.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: DiverseVAR is a training-free method that restores generative diversity in Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models by suppressing pivotal components in input and amplifying them in output, addressing diversity collapse without sacrificing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from diversity collapse (reduced output variability) despite their efficiency advantages over traditional AR and diffusion models, similar to issues in few-step distilled diffusion models.

Method: Suppress the pivotal component of feature maps in model input and amplify it in model output during inference, without requiring any additional training.

Result: Substantially enhances generative diversity with negligible performance impact, effectively unlocking VAR models' inherent generative potential while preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR provides a simple yet effective solution to diversity collapse in VAR models, demonstrating that generative diversity can be restored through careful manipulation of pivotal components without retraining.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences.

TL;DR: A category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework using planar Gaussian Splatting that achieves high-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction from sparse-view RGB images of a single state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing articulated object reconstruction methods require costly multi-stage and multi-view observations, creating limitations for practical applications.

Method: Uses planar Gaussian Splatting with Gaussian information field for viewpoint selection, compresses 3D Gaussians to planar Gaussians for normal/depth estimation, optimizes in coarse-to-fine manner with depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion, and incorporates part segmentation probability.

Result: Achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconstructs articulated objects from sparse-view RGB images without requiring category-specific knowledge or expensive multi-stage observations.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

*He Huang,Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Yao Xiao,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCoVAD is a training-free video anomaly detection framework that uses selective frame processing inspired by human neural pathways, achieving state-of-the-art performance while processing only 28.55% and 16.04% of frames compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video anomaly detection methods using large pre-trained models rely on dense frame-level inference, which incurs high computational costs and latency. The paper questions whether dense reasoning is truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models.

Method: ReCoVAD uses a dual-pathway approach: (1) Reflex pathway with lightweight CLIP-based module for fast response using dynamic memory of past frames, and (2) Conscious pathway with medium-scale vision-language model for refined analysis and periodic review by large language model to identify unseen anomalies and refine prototypes.

Result: ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55% of frames on UCF-Crime and 16.04% on XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

Conclusion: Sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective video anomaly detection when using powerful pre-trained models, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance through selective frame processing.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to bridge the 'affective gap' in visual emotion recognition by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained textual models, using distinct contrastive learning strategies for different sample types in noisy social media data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'affective gap' in visual emotion recognition where pre-trained visual models lack direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, while textual models have explicit emotional expression and high information density.

Method: Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) that separates different types of samples and uses distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type, dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs to exploit noisy samples from social media data.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show that bridging the 'affective gap' significantly improves performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging knowledge from pre-trained textual models through PACL effectively enhances emotional perception of visual models by addressing the affective gap limitation.

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

*Yuan Zhang,Ming Lu,Junwen Pan,Tao Huang,Kuan Cheng,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainV is a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into multimodal reasoning to make reasoning shorter and more efficient by selecting representative visual patches and evaluating their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models exhibit redundant self-reflection in lengthy reasoning chains, and existing CoT compression methods provide limited gains due to static visual references.

Method: ChainV performs coarse visual patch selection based on previous reasoning steps, refines it using averaged attention intensity to find atomic visual hints, evaluates hint reliability with consistency-based mechanism, and incorporates pixel coordinates with Bernoulli stochastic process.

Result: ChainV achieves 2.3% improvement on MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, reduces inference latency by 51.4%, and shortens output token length by 24.5%.

Conclusion: ChainV significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

Motivation: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales is challenging due to modeling limitations, severe motion blur, and lack of physical consistency.

Method: Integrates physical priors with event stream enhancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline; uses triple-level supervision with acceleration constraint, event stream guidance, and Kalman regularizer; employs motion-aware simulated annealing for training scheduling.

Result: Superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods; created first RGB-Event paired dataset for natural, fast rigid motion.

Conclusion: PEGS framework effectively addresses motion reconstruction challenges by combining physical priors, event stream enhancement, and adaptive training strategies.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transitioning from 1D CCT to 2D chromaticity space and using MLP interpolation improves colorimetric accuracy for non-Planckian LED lighting, reducing angular reproduction error by 22% while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LED lighting deviates from Planckian illuminants, exposing limitations of traditional CCT-based colorimetric mapping that assumes illumination lies on the Planckian locus.

Method: Replaces conventional CCT interpolation with lightweight MLP using 2D chromaticity features, trained via lightbox-based calibration with representative LED sources.

Result: 22% average reduction in angular reproduction error for LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, supports multi-illuminant scenes, and enables real-time deployment with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: 2D chromaticity space with MLP interpolation provides superior colorimetric accuracy for modern lighting technologies while preserving computational efficiency and compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage optimization framework for deploying deep learning-based image compression models on FPGAs, addressing quantization degradation through dynamic range-aware quantization and hardware-aware optimizations including mixed-precision search and channel pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying state-of-the-art deep learning image compression models on resource-constrained FPGAs is challenging due to quantization-induced performance degradation and hardware limitations.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) with activation clipping and weight regularization, plus hardware-aware optimizations including progressive mixed-precision search and GDN-adapted channel pruning.

Result: DRAQ reduces BD-rate overhead from 30% to 6.3%, and hardware optimizations reduce computational complexity by over 20% with negligible RD performance impact, creating state-of-the-art FPGA implementation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges floating-point models to efficient integer implementations on FPGAs, achieving superior quality and efficiency compared to existing FPGA-based image compression solutions.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODTSR is a one-step diffusion transformer that achieves state-of-the-art real-world image super-resolution by balancing fidelity and controllability through a novel Noise-hybrid Visual Stream design and Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution methods face a trade-off: multi-step methods have generative diversity but low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning.

Method: ODTSR uses a Noise-hybrid Visual Stream with two streams - one receiving low-quality images with adjustable noise and another with consistent noise, combined with Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training to enable one-step inference while maintaining controllability.

Result: ODTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on generic Real-ISR and enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios like Chinese character text image super-resolution without specific dataset training.

Conclusion: The proposed ODTSR framework successfully balances fidelity and controllability in real-world image super-resolution, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities across various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

TL;DR: CC-DiceCE loss improves small lesion detection in medical image segmentation by increasing recall with minimal segmentation degradation, outperforming blob loss in multi-dataset benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions like Dice under-segment small lesions because their small volume contributes negligibly to overall loss, requiring instance-wise approaches for better lesion detection.

Method: Introduces CC-DiceCE loss based on CC-Metrics framework, benchmarked against blob loss and DiceCE baseline using nnU-Net framework for standardized evaluation.

Result: CC-DiceCE increases detection recall with minimal segmentation performance degradation, though with slightly more false positives, and generally outperforms blob loss across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE is an effective loss function for improving small lesion detection in medical image segmentation while maintaining good segmentation quality.

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

Motivation: Current generative methods for autonomous driving trajectory prediction rely on denoising human-crafted anchors or random noise, leaving significant room for improvement in performance and flexibility.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Transformer-based Proposal Decoder generates coarse trajectory predictions using predefined anchors, 2) Diffusion Refiner iteratively denoises and refines initial predictions with a fine-grained denoising decoder for enhanced scene compliance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, setting new records on both benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining discriminative trajectory proposals with generative refinement significantly enhances diffusion-based planning performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-Styler is a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework that addresses domain shifts in ultrasound images across different devices by preserving source structural content while transferring target texture patterns and ensuring semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images vary across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. Existing unpaired image translation methods often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, leading to misaligned content-class mappings that impair diagnostic accuracy.

Method: UI-Styler uses a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns from target images onto source images while preserving source structural content. It introduces a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain to enforce accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

Result: Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks show that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing unpaired image translation methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: UI-Styler effectively addresses domain shifts in ultrasound imaging by combining texture pattern transfer with class-aware semantic alignment, making it a practical solution for improving the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models across different ultrasound devices.

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

TL;DR: FireScope is a VLM-based framework that uses reasoning-to-generation to predict wildfire risk maps with complementary reasoning traces, achieving cross-continental generalization from USA training to European testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wildfire risk prediction methods lack causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization across different geographical regions.

Method: Proposes FireScope, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with reasoning traces. Uses FireScope-Bench dataset with Sentinel-2 imagery, climate data, and expert-defined risk rasters.

Result: FireScope achieves substantial performance gains when trained in USA and tested in Europe. Expert feedback confirms reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Demonstrates improved generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: Reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. This is the first framework to show language-based reasoning improves generalization in visual generation and enables cross-continental wildfire risk modeling.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

*Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor,Stefan Smeu,Dan Oneata,Elisabeta Oneata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised representations show promise for audio-visual deepfake detection by capturing meaningful patterns across modalities, but fail to generalize reliably across datasets due to dataset-specific characteristics rather than superficial pattern learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate self-supervised representations for audio-visual deepfake detection, which remains underexplored compared to their use in isolation or within complex architectures in prior work.

Method: Systematic evaluation across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content), assessing three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity.

Result: Most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information that is complementary across modalities, with models attending to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. However, none generalize reliably across datasets due to dataset characteristics.

Conclusion: Self-supervised representations learn meaningful patterns for deepfake detection but face fundamental challenges in achieving robust cross-domain performance, exposing both their promise and limitations in this application.

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic sign recognition at night remains challenging due to visual noise, low illumination, and lack of public nighttime datasets. Existing methods struggle with robustness under poor lighting conditions and fail to effectively leverage multimodal cues.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) INTSD dataset with 41 traffic sign classes captured under diverse lighting/weather conditions across India; 2) LENS-Net framework with adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier using cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning.

Conclusion: LENS-Net provides a comprehensive solution for nighttime traffic sign recognition by integrating adaptive enhancement with multimodal reasoning, addressing the limitations of existing methods in low-light conditions.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recapture methods have suboptimal camera motion injection strategies that limit control precision and fail to preserve fine visual details from source videos.

Method: Introduces a query-shared cross-attention module that integrates 6-DoF camera poses and 2D rendered video frames into a unified representation, using a two-stage training strategy: first learning coarse camera control from poses, then incorporating visual information for refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: PostCam provides a framework for accurate and flexible camera trajectory editing in dynamic scenes, significantly improving both control precision and visual quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage noise-decoupling framework for HSI denoising that decomposes complex noise into explicit and implicit components, using pre-training for explicit noise and high-frequency wavelet guidance for implicit noise, with multi-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise modeling methods struggle with complex real-world noise in hyperspectral images, as accurate noise modeling is difficult, limiting denoising effectiveness.

Method: Multi-stage framework that decouples noise into explicit (modeled) and implicit (unmodeled) components. Uses pre-training with existing noise models for explicit noise, and high-frequency wavelet guided network for implicit noise. Employs separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and captured datasets show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage noise-decoupling framework successfully addresses complex real-world HSI noise by decomposing it into manageable components and using adaptive learning strategies, achieving superior denoising performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with spatiotemporally coherent manipulation due to limitations in achieving temporally coherent control over action execution.

Method: Proposes 4D-aware visual representation by embedding 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and spatiotemporal action representation that extends spatial actions with temporal information for planning.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority across different robotic manipulation tasks, with the model achieving spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent manipulation.

Conclusion: VLA-4D successfully enables spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation through unified 4D-aware representations and temporal action extensions.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges with heterogeneous privacy policies making joint training infeasible, and SAM's large parameter count/computational overhead limits practical deployment despite its strong zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Proposes Alignment Layer - a lightweight plug-and-play module to align encoder-decoder feature distributions, and CA-SAM - a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts Alignment Layers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual learning scenarios, improving accuracy while reducing computation.

Conclusion: The SAM paradigm is highly promising for medical image segmentation when computational efficiency and performance are balanced through the proposed Alignment Layer and CA-SAM approach.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic image super-resolution faces challenges with limited real-world LR-HR data and complex degradation patterns. Pre-trained SR models from synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge that can improve generalization and reduce data requirements.

Method: Proposes Dual-domain Adaptation Networks with spatial-domain adaptation (selective parameter updating and low-rank adaptation) and frequency domain adaptation (combining spectral data and spatial features to infer HR frequency maps).

Result: Experimental evaluations on RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world SR tasks by leveraging pre-trained models and dual-domain adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

*Yuming Yang,Michael K. Ng,Zhigang Jia,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel quaternion-based blind deconvolution method for color images that preserves color channel relationships through a specialized fidelity term and normalized quaternion kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind deconvolution methods for color images either convert to grayscale or process channels separately, ignoring important inter-channel relationships, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes a quaternion fidelity term using a quaternion convolution kernel with four components: one for overall blur and three unconstrained kernels for RGB channel interdependencies, with normalized quaternion kernel to preserve image intensity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real blurred color image datasets show effective artifact removal and significant improvement in deblurring effects compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed quaternion-based method demonstrates strong potential as an effective tool for color image blind deconvolution by properly handling color channel relationships.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

Method: Four feedback strategies: 1) Classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) that refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results; 2) Generative relevance feedback (GRF) using synthetic captions for query refinement; 3) Attentive feedback summarizer (AFS) - a custom transformer model integrating multimodal fine-grained features; 4) Explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as upper-bound baseline.

Result: Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO datasets show GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs and 1-3% for larger ones compared to no feedback. AFS mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings.

Conclusion: Relevance feedback consistently enhances retrieval across VLMs and opens opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search, providing a model-agnostic approach that can work with or without fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

TL;DR: MolSight is a three-stage learning framework for Optical Chemical Structure Recognition that addresses challenges in stereochemical information recognition through pre-training, multi-granularity fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCSR systems struggle with accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to subtle visual cues like wedge/dash bonds and spatial arrangements, which is crucial for chemical data mining, drug discovery, and LLM applications.

Method: Three-stage training: 1) Pre-training on large noisy datasets for fundamental perception, 2) Multi-granularity fine-tuning with chemical bond classification and atom localization tasks, 3) Reinforcement learning optimization using GRPO algorithm and novel stereochemical dataset.

Result: MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in stereochemical optical structure recognition, demonstrating that even with compact parameter size, GRPO algorithm can further enhance stereomolecular recognition capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed MolSight framework effectively addresses stereochemical recognition challenges in OCSR through its comprehensive three-stage learning approach and achieves superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finger pose estimation methods on portable devices rely solely on capacitive images, which are limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and have reduced accuracy for large-angle inputs (>45 degrees).

Method: Proposes BiFingerPose using bimodal input: capacitive image and fingerprint patch from under-screen fingerprint sensor. This enables reliable estimation of roll angle and improves prediction of other pose parameters.

Conclusion: BiFingerPose demonstrates practical superiority for finger pose estimation and enables new applications in authentication security and interactive experiences, with developed prototypes showcasing interaction potential.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialGeo is a novel MLLM that enhances spatial reasoning by combining CLIP's semantic features with geometry features through hierarchical fusion, achieving 8.0% accuracy improvement with 50% less memory cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MLLMs have limited spatial reasoning ability due to lossy visual embeddings from CLIP that focus only on instance-level semantics, lacking spatial awareness.

Method: Proposes hierarchical fusion of CLIP semantic features with geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, trained with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions.

Result: Improves accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench while reducing memory cost by approximately 50% during inference.

Conclusion: SpatialGeo effectively enhances MLLMs' spatial grounding capability through geometry-semantics fusion, achieving significant improvements in spatial reasoning with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

*Dongbo Shi,Shen Cao,Bojian Wu,Jinhui Guo,Lubin Fan,Renjie Chen,Ligang Liu,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPe-NeRF++ is a local-to-global optimization method for training Neural Radiance Fields without pose priors, combining local joint optimization with global bundle adjustment to achieve superior pose estimation and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NoPe-NeRF that rely only on local image relationships struggle with accurate camera pose recovery in complex scenarios, creating a need for more robust pose estimation techniques.

Method: Uses relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by local joint optimization to enhance pose estimation, then global optimization with bundle adjustment incorporating geometric consistency constraints and feature trajectories.

Result: Significantly improves initial pose quality, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis, and demonstrates superior performance and robustness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines local and global cues with NeRF, achieving robust performance in challenging scenes and validating the local-to-global optimization approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

### [91] [Refracting Reality: Generating Images with Realistic Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17340)
*Yue Yin,Enze Tao,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to generate images with accurate refraction of transparent objects by synchronizing pixels using Snell's Law and recovering occluded surfaces through panorama generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative image models perform poorly on transparent objects due to their inability to accurately model optical phenomena like refraction, reflection, and scattering, particularly the complex color constraints imposed by refracted rays intersecting with other surfaces.

Method: The approach synchronizes pixels within and outside object boundaries using Snell's Law of Refraction during generation, and recovers occluded surfaces by generating a panorama centered at the object and applying the same warping and merging procedure.

Result: The method generates optically-plausible images that respect physical constraints, significantly improving the quality of refractive object synthesis compared to standard generative models.

Conclusion: By explicitly incorporating optical physics through pixel synchronization and panorama-based surface recovery, the approach successfully addresses the limitations of current generative models in rendering transparent objects with accurate refraction.

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for generating multi-media painting tutorials with semantics-driven style control, enabling consistent texture evolution and process transfer across different artistic media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video painting tutorials lack interactivity and personalization, while current generative models struggle with temporal consistency and faithful reproduction of human creative workflows across different media.

Method: Uses diffusion models with multiple media embedding in conditional space, cross-medium style augmentation, and reverse-painting training strategy to ensure smooth, human-aligned generation.

Result: Achieves strong performance on cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity metrics (LPIPS, DINO, CLIP), and introduces Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve to quantitatively model human artistic progression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates coherent painting processes across multiple media with consistent style control, effectively capturing the human creative workflow from composition to detail refinement.

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and time consumption of acquiring large manually labeled datasets for skeleton-based action recognition.

Method: Proposes a novel acquisition function that scores the most informative subsets for labeling by optimizing an objective function combining data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. Also extends this with an invertible GCN to map data to latent spaces for better capturing data distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets show the method's effectiveness and outperformance against related work.

Conclusion: The proposed label-frugal GCNs provide an effective solution for skeleton-based action recognition with reduced labeling requirements.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

*Xiangteng He,Shunsuke Sakai,Kun Yuan,Nicolas Padoy,Tatsuhito Hasegawa,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSeq-JEPA is a sequential joint-embedding predictive architecture that improves upon I-JEPA by introducing discriminative ordering of region predictions based on visual importance, inspired by human attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-JEPA treats all image regions uniformly and independently, lacking selective attention and sequential reasoning like human visual perception, which processes information from most to least informative regions.

Method: DSeq-JEPA first identifies primary discriminative regions using transformer-derived saliency maps, then predicts subsequent regions in discriminative order, combining JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments across image classification, fine-grained categorization, detection/segmentation, and low-level reasoning tasks show DSeq-JEPA consistently learns more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

Conclusion: The proposed discriminative sequential approach effectively bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, demonstrating superior performance by mimicking human-like selective attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level radiomics analysis on H&E images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cell classification and tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes but remain largely unexplored, with no dedicated backbone for radiomics data. Existing methods focus on slide-level or patch-level analysis.

Method: Proposed a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone that flexibly combines Attention and Mamba modules in a single architecture, eliminating manual ratio tuning. Developed two UAM variants and extended it to a multimodal framework for joint cell classification and image segmentation.

Result: UAM achieved state-of-the-art performance: improved cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% (n=349,882 cells) and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% (n=406 patches), surpassing leading image-based foundation models.

Conclusion: UAM demonstrates effectiveness as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis, highlighting the promise of cell-level radiomics analysis for improved diagnostic accuracy and AI interpretability.

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

*Seamie Hayes,Reenu Mohandas,Tim Brophy,Alexandre Boulch,Ganesh Sistu,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperQuadricOcc introduces a superquadric-based scene representation for semantic occupancy estimation in automated driving, achieving 75% memory reduction, 124% faster inference, and 5.9% mIoU improvement over Gaussian-based methods while enabling real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian representations in self-supervised occupancy estimation require large numbers of primitives, increasing memory requirements and preventing real-time inference. Superquadrics offer reduced primitive count and lower memory but lack a suitable rasterizer for model supervision.

Method: Uses superquadric-based scene representation with multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics to enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training, without requiring temporal labels.

Result: Achieves 75% reduction in memory footprint, 124% faster inference, and 5.9% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods on Occ3D dataset. Reduces primitive count by 84% relative to Gaussian approaches.

Conclusion: SuperQuadricOcc is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance, demonstrating that superquadrics provide an efficient alternative to Gaussian representations for semantic occupancy estimation in automated driving.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: ATAC is a simple yet effective test-time defense method that corrects adversarial perturbations in CLIP's embedding space using augmentation-induced drift vectors and angular consistency, achieving 50% higher robustness than previous methods with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on images, and adversarial fine-tuning is too expensive. Existing test-time defense strategies have limited robustness, so a more effective and efficient approach is needed.

Method: ATAC operates in CLIP's embedding space by calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer semantic recovery directions and correcting embeddings based on angular consistency of these latent drifts.

Result: ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness across benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50% on average, with minimal computational overhead. It maintains robustness in extreme settings and shows nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: ATAC represents an efficient novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in CLIP's embedding space, providing strong protection against adversarial perturbations without requiring expensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

TL;DR: SVRecon extends sparse voxel rasterization with SDF for high-fidelity surface reconstruction, addressing optimization challenges through geometric initialization and spatial smoothness loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse voxels have sharp boundaries and spatial disentanglement that make them prone to local minima during optimization, while maintaining SDF smoothness across independently parameterized voxels is challenging.

Method: Integrates SDF with sparse voxels, using robust geometric initialization from visual geometry models and spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups.

Result: Achieves strong reconstruction accuracy across various benchmarks with consistently speedy convergence.

Conclusion: SVRecon successfully combines sparse voxels with SDF for high-fidelity surface reconstruction while maintaining smoothness and fast convergence.

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

*Zheng Wang,Yi Zhang,Siddartha Khastgir,Carsten Maple,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness (NPPR), a practical robustness metric that learns perturbation distributions directly from data without predefined assumptions, addressing limitations of existing probabilistic robustness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic robustness formulations assume fixed and known perturbation distributions, which is unrealistic in practice. This limitation motivates the need for a more practical robustness metric that can handle distributional uncertainty.

Method: NPPR learns optimized perturbation distributions directly from data using a Gaussian Mixture Model with MLP heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering both input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across multiple architectures show NPPR provides up to 40% more conservative (lower) probabilistic robustness estimates compared to assuming common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NPPR is validated as a more practical robustness metric that effectively addresses distributional uncertainty in probabilistic robustness evaluation, providing more conservative and realistic estimates than existing approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

Method: Reformulates DIR as spatially continuous optimization in latent feature space using stochastic Gaussian policy head, integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization with multi-trajectory sampling.

Result: Achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, Abdomen MR-CT) while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low latency.

Conclusion: MorphSeek advances representation-level policy learning paradigm for spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, providing backbone-agnostic and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

TL;DR: MCMoE is a novel framework for multimodal Action Quality Assessment that handles missing modalities by dynamically reconstructing them using available information and learning joint representations through a mixture of experts approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal AQA models fail when modalities are missing during inference, causing catastrophic performance degradation due to interrupted cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes MCMoE with adaptive gated modality generator to reconstruct missing modalities, modality experts for unimodal knowledge, and dynamic mixing of expert knowledge for joint representations. Uses complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on three public AQA benchmarks in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MCMoE effectively addresses the missing modality problem in multimodal AQA by unifying unimodal and joint representation learning, enabling robust performance even with incomplete multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMT-ARD effectively enhances adversarial robustness of multimodal large models through multi-teacher collaboration and adaptive knowledge fusion, demonstrating scalability and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on using vision foundation models (VFMs) for unsupervised domain adaptation in lidar semantic segmentation, identifying key architectural choices and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks trained on one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars, creating a need for domain adaptation methods that can bridge this performance gap.

Method: Leverages vision foundation models through unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, focusing on lidar backbone architecture, pretraining a single backbone for multiple domain shifts, and keeping the backbone frozen while training an MLP head.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in four challenging domain adaptation settings for lidar semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The study provides effective recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation, demonstrating that proper backbone architecture and training strategy can significantly improve generalization across different lidar domains.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based odometry method effectively leverages GPR B-scan image features for precise distance estimation, demonstrating superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

*Yiqing Shen,Aiza Maksutova,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWMDT transforms standard video diffusion models into counterfactual world models by creating digital twin representations of scenes, using LLMs to predict intervention effects, and generating counterfactual videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models focus on factual predictions but lack counterfactual reasoning capabilities needed for evaluating AI behavior under hypothetical scenarios like object removal.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Construct digital twins as structured text representations of objects and relationships, 2) Use LLMs to predict intervention propagation, 3) Condition video diffusion models with modified representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, demonstrating that digital twin representations provide effective control for counterfactual video simulation.

Conclusion: Alternative video representations like digital twins offer powerful control signals for counterfactual world modeling, enabling targeted interventions on specific scene properties.

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

TL;DR: Radar2Shape is a denoising diffusion model that reconstructs 3D shapes from partially-observed high-frequency radar signals using frequency-shape correlation and hierarchical multiresolution features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to represent arbitrary shapes from limited-view radar signals, and optical 3D reconstruction approaches struggle when naively treating radar as camera views, creating a gap for robust radar-based 3D reconstruction.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) learning a regularized latent space with hierarchical shape features at multiple resolutions, 2) diffusion into this latent space conditioned on radar signal frequencies in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Radar2Shape successfully reconstructs arbitrary 3D shapes from partially-observed radar signals and demonstrates robust generalization across two simulation methods and real-world data.

Conclusion: The method enables effective 3D shape reconstruction from radar signals, with released synthetic benchmark datasets to support future research and safe adaptation to real-world radar systems.

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

TL;DR: A deep learning method to estimate spine age from MRI images, using clustering to identify age-related degeneration patterns and showing that the spine age gap correlates with degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations visible in MRI, and there's a need for automated methods to assess spine health and degeneration patterns.

Method: Computer vision deep learning using 18,000+ MRI series, with UMAP and HDBSCAN clustering to identify age-related degeneration patterns, followed by ablation studies on data size, loss functions, and spine regions.

Result: The spine age gap (SAG) - difference between actual and predicted age - is associated with disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, fractures, smoking, and physically demanding work.

Conclusion: Spine age gap may serve as a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health and detecting degenerative conditions.

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical demands require smaller, efficient multimodal systems, but downscaling LLMs disproportionately affects visual capabilities rather than inherited LLM abilities, creating a performance bottleneck.

Method: Introduces Extract+Think approach: 1) Visual extraction tuning to train models to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently, 2) Step-by-step reasoning using extracted details to generate answers.

Result: The approach sets new standards for efficiency and performance in downscaled multimodal models, addressing the disproportionate impact of LLM downscaling on visual capabilities.

Conclusion: Visual extraction tuning combined with step-by-step reasoning effectively maintains multimodal performance in smaller, more efficient models, overcoming the bottleneck caused by LLM downscaling.

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video QA models fail on fine-grained evidence due to single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations. Humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, which inspired the need for iterative visual reasoning.

Method: Multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO-based reinforcement learning on two datasets: Video-R4-CoT-17k for practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for RL.

Result: Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA.

Conclusion: Iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning, enabling better understanding of text-rich videos through repeated inspection of critical regions.

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: EvDiff is an event-based diffusion model that generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams using a surrogate training framework and single forward diffusion step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras record sparse brightness changes but reconstructing intensity images is ill-posed due to absolute brightness ambiguity. Existing regression methods yield perceptually inferior results and struggle with scaling model capacity and training data.

Method: Proposes EvDiff with surrogate training framework that eliminates need for paired event-image datasets, uses single forward diffusion step to reduce computational cost, and employs temporally consistent EvEncoder for video generation from monochromatic events.

Result: Generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: EvDiff strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, enabling scalable high-quality video generation from event data without paired datasets.

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

Motivation: Existing instruction-guided 3D editing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are too slow, while feed-forward approaches using multi-view 2D editing suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality.

Method: Created a large-scale multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing covering diverse tasks, then explored two conditioning strategies: conventional cross-attention and a novel 3D token concatenation approach.

Result: Token concatenation proved more parameter-efficient and achieved superior performance, with extensive evaluations showing the method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed native 3D editing framework sets a new benchmark for instruction-guided 3D editing by directly manipulating 3D representations efficiently while maintaining consistency and quality.

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

TL;DR: Visual creativity comparison shows a clear gradient: Visual Artists > Non Artists > Human Inspired AI > Self Guided AI. Human guidance significantly improves AI creativity, but human and AI raters show different judgment patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs match human creativity in language tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored, with potential unique challenges in visual domains due to perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity.

Method: Compared image generation between human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and AI model with two prompting conditions (Human Inspired with high human input, Self Guided with low input). Used human raters (N=255) and GPT4o to evaluate creativity.

Result: Clear creativity gradient observed with Visual Artists most creative, followed by Non Artists, Human Inspired AI, and Self Guided AI. Human guidance strongly improved AI creativity, bringing it close to Non Artists level. Human and AI raters showed different judgment patterns.

Conclusion: GenAI faces unique challenges in visual creativity compared to language tasks, as visual creativity depends on distinctly human capacities like perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity that may not transfer well from language models.

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable cognitive control layer for LLMs by repurposing the simplicity of retro BASIC programming concepts to structure reasoning processes.

Method: Developed a BASIC-style prompting language with numbered lines and simple commands, plus a natural-language interpreter file that specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. The system extracts declarative/procedural knowledge and detects contradictions.

Result: Comparison across three LLMs on knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks showed all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC successfully enables transparent multi-step reasoning in LLMs through explicit execution traces, demonstrating that modern LLMs can reliably simulate short programs for interpretable cognitive control.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

TL;DR: A framework for systematic benchmark revision that uses statistical analysis of response patterns to identify potentially invalid questions, with LLM-judge assistance to reduce human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invalid benchmark questions undermine AI evaluation reliability, and manual error identification among thousands of questions is infeasible and a critical bottleneck.

Method: Leverages statistical analysis of response patterns based on the assumption that mean score summarizes model performance, flagging items with statistics outside expected ranges for expert review, plus LLM-judge first pass.

Result: Across nine widely used benchmarks, the method identifies problematic questions with up to 84% precision and reduces human effort through automated first-pass review.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision that combines statistical analysis with automated assistance to improve benchmark reliability.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism to solve vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, combining Temporal Difference Reward and Action Gradient Reward to improve policy gradient SNR and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state-based reward functions suffer from vanishing reward differences in high-frequency continuous control tasks, leading to low signal-to-noise ratio for policy gradients and hindering algorithm convergence and performance.

Method: HDR integrates two components: Temporal Difference Reward based on global potential function for long-term objectives, and Action Gradient Reward for local guidance with high SNR. Formulates cooperative driving as Multi-Agent POMDP with time-varying agent set.

Result: Extensive experiments with MCTS, QMIX, MAPPO, and MADDPG show HDR significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability, enabling agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies balancing traffic efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: HDR mechanism effectively addresses vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, providing high SNR policy gradients that guide agents to learn effective cooperative behaviors while maintaining optimal policy invariance.

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

TL;DR: The paper presents verbal and visual UI extensions for Bayesian Networks to improve user understanding of probabilistic reasoning, showing that combined verbal-visual interfaces outperform baseline and single-modality approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Networks are considered transparent models but users still struggle to understand them, and current user interfaces fail to clarify BN reasoning processes.

Method: Designed verbal and visual extensions to standard BN UI, then conducted a user study comparing verbal, visual, combined extensions, and baseline UI across different question types about inference patterns.

Result: (1) All three extension types performed better than baseline for questions about observation impact, enabling paths, and influence of other observations; (2) Combined verbal-visual modality was superior to single modalities for some question types.

Conclusion: Combining verbal and visual UI extensions effectively improves user understanding of Bayesian Network reasoning, with the multimodal approach providing the best results for certain inference tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

TL;DR: MirrorMind is a hierarchical cognitive architecture for AI scientists that integrates individual cognitive models and collective disciplinary knowledge through a three-level framework, enabling more human-like scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches treat scientific discovery as solitary optimization, ignoring that human scientific insight comes from both individual cognitive trajectories and collective disciplinary memory.

Method: Three-level hierarchical architecture: Individual Level (cognitive models of researchers), Domain Level (disciplinary concept graphs), and Interdisciplinary Level (orchestration engine), with separated memory storage and agentic execution.

Result: Evaluated across four tasks (cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, multi-agent problem solving), showing improved structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: MirrorMind successfully bridges the gap between individual cognitive depth and collective disciplinary breadth, enabling AI scientists to move beyond simple fact retrieval toward more human-like scientific reasoning.

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Budget-aware scaling methods for tool-augmented agents that dynamically adapt planning based on remaining tool-call budgets, improving cost-performance scaling curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simply increasing tool-call budgets for agents doesn't improve performance due to lack of budget awareness, creating a need for systematic approaches to scale agents effectively under explicit budget constraints.

Method: Developed Budget Tracker (lightweight plug-in for continuous budget awareness) and BATS framework that dynamically adapts planning and verification strategies based on remaining resources, deciding when to dig deeper or pivot to new paths.

Result: Budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier, enabling more effective scaling of tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: Budget awareness is crucial for effective scaling of tool-augmented agents, offering empirical insights toward more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in these systems.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

*Hao Chen,Renzheng Zhang,Scott S. Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets score-based diffusion for inverse problems as an EM-style framework, introducing DAPS++ which decouples diffusion initialization from data-driven refinement for more efficient and stable reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bayesian interpretation of score-based diffusion fails to explain its practical behavior where the prior offers limited guidance and reconstruction is largely driven by measurement consistency, effectively decoupling from diffusion dynamics.

Method: Reinterpret diffusion as initialization in an EM-style framework, introduce DAPS++ that allows likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability, with decoupled diffusion stage and data-driven refinement.

Result: DAPS++ achieves high computational efficiency with fewer function evaluations and measurement-optimization steps, providing robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The EM-style framework clarifies diffusion's role in inverse problems, showing unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice while DAPS++ enables more direct likelihood guidance with improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

*Paloma Rabaey,Adrick Tench,Stefan Heytens,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal method for patient-level information extraction that combines structured EHR data (via Bayesian network) and unstructured clinical notes (via neural text classifiers) using virtual evidence with consistency nodes for improved calibration and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage both structured and unstructured EHR data for clinical decision support systems, as much valuable patient information is contained in unstructured text like discharge summaries and nursing notes.

Method: Multi-modal fusion using expert-informed Bayesian network for tabular EHR features and neural text classifiers for clinical notes, enhanced with virtual evidence and consistency nodes to handle missing information and resolve contradictions.

Result: The consistency node improves calibration of final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing better adjustment of neural classifier outputs and handling of missing data and contradictions.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows potential for interpretable, probabilistic fusion of multi-modal EHR data, demonstrated on the SimSUM benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited integration of the BDI model into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations despite its importance in AI and cognitive sciences.

Method: Created a formal BDI Ontology as a modular Ontology Design Pattern, aligned with foundational ontologies, and tested through two experiments: (1) coupling with LLMs via Logic Augmented Generation, and (2) integration with Semas reasoning platform using T2B2T paradigm.

Result: The ontology successfully bridges declarative and procedural intelligence, enabling bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states, and enhances inferential coherence and consistency when combined with LLMs.

Conclusion: The BDI Ontology serves as both conceptual and operational bridge, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems in the Web of Data.

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Bang Zhang,Zeping Yin,Zipeng Ye*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a method that enhances multi-agent reinforcement learning performance in sparse reward environments by incentivizing agents to explore actions that affect teammates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Episodic rewards pose challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning due to exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories and existing methods' failure to account for joint actions influencing team states.

Method: Proposes Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR) - a simple enhancement strategy that incentivizes individual agents to explore actions affecting teammates, combined with original strategies to stimulate team exploration.

Result: Experimental validation using extended MiniGrid-MA environments shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in sparse reward settings.

Conclusion: MIR effectively addresses the challenges of sparse rewards in MARL by promoting team exploration through mutual influence incentives, demonstrating improved algorithm performance.

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

*Kaiyu Li,Jiayu Wang,Zhi Wang,Hui Qiao,Weizhan Zhang,Deyu Meng,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTAM, a hierarchical task abstraction framework for building specialized multi-agent systems that outperform general approaches in complex domains like geospatial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General agent frameworks struggle in specialized domains requiring structured workflows, multi-step procedures, and specialized tools, particularly in fields like remote sensing with complex dependencies.

Method: Proposed Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) that structures multi-agent systems into logical hierarchies mirroring domain task dependencies, enforcing procedural correctness through sequential layers where each layer's agents operate on previous outputs.

Result: EarthAgent (HTAM instantiation for geospatial analysis) substantially outperforms established single- and multi-agent systems on GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step geospatial planning tasks.

Conclusion: Aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is critical for building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems, moving beyond social role emulation to task-centric hierarchical organization.

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Motivation: To create agentic AI systems that are not only capable and flexible but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable by complementing agency assumptions with explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance.

Method: Align adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination using AAMAS community tools including BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modeling.

Result: A perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy, providing a foundation for developing comprehensive agentic systems.

Conclusion: The conceptual tools from the AAMAS community offer a solid foundation for realizing agentic AI systems with the desired properties of transparency, cooperation, and accountability.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

*Nathalie Kirch,Samuel Dower,Adrians Skapars,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how using synthetic and off-policy data affects probe generalization for monitoring LLM behaviors, finding that response generation strategy impacts performance and that same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than different-domain on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural examples of concerning LLM behaviors are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy responses for training probes, but it's unclear how this affects probe generalization across different behaviors.

Method: Systematically evaluated linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs for eight distinct behaviors, testing how synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalization to on-policy scenarios.

Result: Response generation strategy significantly affects probe performance, successful off-policy generalization predicts on-policy success, and domain shifts cause larger performance degradation than policy shifts.

Conclusion: In absence of on-policy data, same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than different-domain on-policy data, highlighting the need for better methods to handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SRA-CP is a decentralized cooperative perception framework that enables connected vehicles to selectively share safety-critical perception data only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected, achieving near-perfect safety performance with 80% bandwidth reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative perception approaches transmit excessive irrelevant data exceeding bandwidth limits and rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments.

Method: Uses a decentralized protocol where vehicles broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries, locally assess occlusion risks, and initiate targeted cooperation only when safety-critical blind zones are detected. Includes perceptual risk identification and selective information exchange with bandwidth adaptation.

Result: Achieves less than 1% AP loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP while using only 20% of communication bandwidth. Improves perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods without risk awareness.

Conclusion: SRA-CP provides an efficient and practical solution for cooperative perception that balances communication efficiency with safety-critical perception performance in dynamic traffic environments.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.

Motivation: To handle temporal logic task planning in large environments where full task compliance may be unattainable, and to incorporate user preferences for relaxation into the planning process.

Method: Proposed an A*-based planning framework using automata-based representations for temporal logic goals and user preferences, with a simple efficient heuristic for large-scale problems.

Result: The approach effectively tackles large-scale problems, generates near-optimal high-level trajectories, and significantly reduces planning time and search memory compared to uninformed search algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed heuristic enables efficient planning over large robot environments with demonstrated scalability, improved runtime, and empirical bounds on suboptimality through extensive case studies.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of planning for temporal logic tasks in large robot environments. When full task compliance is unattainable, we aim to achieve the best possible task satisfaction by integrating user preferences for relaxation into the planning process. Utilizing the automata-based representations for temporal logic goals and user preferences, we propose an A*-based planning framework. This approach effectively tackles large-scale problems while generating near-optimal high-level trajectories. To facilitate this, we propose a simple, efficient heuristic that allows for planning over large robot environments in a fraction of time and search memory as compared to uninformed search algorithms. We present extensive case studies to demonstrate the scalability, runtime analysis as well as empirical bounds on the suboptimality of the proposed heuristic.

Conclusion: SPTS offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces by significantly reducing wiring complexity and measurement requirements while enabling high-speed performance.

Abstract: Development of large-area, high-speed electronic skins is a grand challenge for robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces, but is fundamentally limited by wiring complexity and data bottlenecks. Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces.

*Yendo Hu,Yiliang Wu,Weican Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid algorithm combining improved MRF IAPF with enhanced APF for multi-UAV obstacle avoidance, addressing path redundancy and collision risks through interaction forces and temporary waypoint strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional APF methods in multi-UAV scenarios cause redundant flight paths, frequent heading changes, and high collision risks during obstacle avoidance, necessitating improved path planning.

Method: Combines improved MRF IAPF (with obstacle repulsion, inter-UAV interaction, and target attraction forces) with enhanced APF, adding collision risk assessment and auxiliary sub-goal strategy with temporary waypoints for high-threat situations.

Result: Simulation results show significant improvements in path length optimization and heading stability compared to traditional APF, with effective obstacle avoidance and quick formation restoration in static unknown environments.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid algorithm demonstrates applicability and effectiveness for multi-UAV formation obstacle avoidance in static environments with unknown obstacles.

Abstract: In multi UAV scenarios,the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method often leads to redundant flight paths and frequent abrupt heading changes due to unreasonable obstacle avoidance path planning,and is highly prone to inter UAV collisions during the obstacle avoidance process.To address these issues,this study proposes a novel hybrid algorithm that combines the improved Multi-Robot Formation Obstacle Avoidance (MRF IAPF) algorithm with an enhanced APF optimized for single UAV path planning.Its core ideas are as follows:first,integrating three types of interaction forces from MRF IAPF obstacle repulsion force,inter UAV interaction force,and target attraction force;second,incorporating a refined single UAV path optimization mechanism,including collision risk assessment and an auxiliary sub goal strategy.When a UAV faces a high collision threat,temporary waypoints are generated to guide obstacle avoidance,ensuring eventual precise arrival at the actual target.Simulation results demonstrate that compared with traditional APF based formation algorithms,the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements in path length optimization and heading stability,can effectively avoid obstacles and quickly restore the formation configuration,thus verifying its applicability and effectiveness in static environments with unknown obstacles.

Abstract: Dense 3D semantic occupancy perception is critical for mobile robots operating in pedestrian-rich environments, yet it remains underexplored compared to its application in autonomous driving. To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.

TL;DR: CalibAll is a training-free camera extrinsic estimation method that uses only a single mark on the end-effector and vision foundation models to achieve accurate calibration across diverse robots and datasets through coarse-to-fine pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera extrinsics are crucial for imitation learning but often unavailable, and existing estimation methods suffer from local minima and poor generalization.

Method: Uses a single mark on end-effector, leverages vision foundation models for mark localization, applies temporal PnP for coarse estimation, and refines with rendering-based optimization aligning rendered and ground-truth masks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with strong robustness across three robot platforms, and provides auxiliary annotations like depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories.

Conclusion: CalibAll offers a simple yet effective solution for camera extrinsic estimation that is training-free, stable, and accurate across diverse robotic systems.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in a variety of robotic tasks by learning a mapping function from camera-space observations to robot-space actions. Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model-based methods assume static environments and fail in dynamic scenarios, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations, limiting adaptability to real-time changes.

Method: Leverages multi-frame point constraints (current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module) and incorporates a prediction module that forecasts future paths of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations for proactive planning.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing enhanced navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables proactive end-to-end navigation by anticipating and avoiding potential dangers through multi-frame constraint integration and obstacle path prediction.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance in complex and dynamic environments is a critical challenge for real-time robot navigation. Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers. This proactive planning capability significantly enhances navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [134] [H-GAR: A Hierarchical Interaction Framework via Goal-Driven Observation-Action Refinement for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17079)
*Yijie Zhu,Rui Shao,Ziyang Liu,Jie He,Jizhihui Liu,Jiuru Wang,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-GAR is a hierarchical framework for robotic manipulation that integrates goal-driven observation and action refinement through explicit interaction between video prediction and action planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat observation and action generation monolithically without goal guidance, leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors in robotic manipulation.

Method: H-GAR uses a hierarchical approach: 1) generates goal observation and coarse action sketch, 2) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer synthesizes intermediate observations, 3) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner refines actions using feedback from observations and Historical Action Memory Bank.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner enables more accurate manipulation in robotic systems.

Abstract: Unified video and action prediction models hold great potential for robotic manipulation, as future observations offer contextual cues for planning, while actions reveal how interactions shape the environment. However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning for vision-language navigation by predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations, enabling more accurate navigation through a three-stage training framework without expensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods focus on direct action prediction or numeric progress metrics, overlooking the monotonic co-progression property between observations and instructions, which limits navigation consistency over long horizons.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps reasoning via differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes, 2) Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into navigation context, 3) Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with progress-aware reinforcement objectives.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, showing improved success rates and efficiency while demonstrating that semantic progress yields more consistent navigation advancement representation.

Conclusion: Semantic progress reasoning enables more accurate and consistent vision-language navigation by capturing the monotonic co-progression between observations and instructions, outperforming previous methods that overlooked this property.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation requires agents to act coherently over long horizons by understanding not only local visual context but also how far they have advanced within a multi-step instruction. However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.

Conclusion: The reflection-based localization system provides a robust solution for multi-robot relative localization that works effectively in challenging environments including dynamic water surfaces, with superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Reflections of active markers in the environment are a common source of ambiguity in onboard visual relative localization. This work presents a novel approach for onboard relative localization in multi-robot teams that exploits these typically unwanted reflections of active markers in the environment.

TL;DR: Proposes using LLMs alongside black-box optimization to improve robot design efficiency by leveraging problem context and feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical optimization is fast but limited for complex/discrete structures, while black-box optimization is inefficient requiring many samples.

Method: Combines black-box optimization with LLM-based sampling using problem settings and extensive feedback.

Result: Enables more efficient exploration of robot design solutions compared to black-box optimization alone.

Conclusion: LLM-enhanced black-box optimization improves robot design efficiency but has limitations to consider.

Abstract: Various methods for robot design optimization have been developed so far. These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.

Motivation: Traditional single-demand navigation doesn't reflect real-world complexity where people have multiple needs and personal preferences when moving through spaces to find objects.

Method: AWMSystem with BreakLLM (decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), StatusMLLM (monitoring), MASMap spatial memory combining 3D point clouds and 2D semantic mapping, and Dual-Tempo action generation with Adaptive Error Corrector.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional demand-driven navigation by handling multiple sub-demands with explicit preferences through an integrated autonomous decision-making system.

Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

TL;DR: A MuJoCo-based simulator for soft robotic nets to autonomously capture space debris like Envisat, featuring net dynamics, orbital mechanics, and thruster control, showing compliant nets with sliding mode control achieve 100% capture success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing problem of space debris by developing an effective autonomous capture system using soft robotic nets, particularly for large debris like the Envisat satellite.

Method: Developed a simulator using MuJoCo physics engine that includes net dynamics, contact modeling, orbital mechanics, and thruster control. Investigated different mechanical models for net compliance and various control strategies, starting from static configurations rather than pre-thrown nets.

Result: Compliant nets achieved higher performance in capturing Envisat. When combined with sliding mode control, soft nets achieved 100% capture success rate, with larger effective contact area and more contact points between net and debris.

Conclusion: Soft robotic nets with appropriate compliance and sliding mode control are highly effective for autonomous space debris removal, offering reliable capture performance and better contact characteristics compared to stiffer alternatives.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simulator, based on the open-source physics engine MuJoCo, for the design and control of soft robotic nets for the autonomous removal of space debris. The proposed simulator includes net dynamics, contact between the net and the debris, self-contact of the net, orbital mechanics, and a controller that can actuate thrusters on the four satellites at the corners of the net. It showcases the case of capturing Envisat, a large ESA satellite that remains in orbit as space debris following the end of its mission. This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat.

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to determine multifingered gripper joint configurations from point cloud data, achieving high speed (0.05ms) and accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse kinematics methods for gripper joint configuration require post-hoc decision-making or numerical approximations for complex kinematics, which can be inefficient and challenging.

Method: Uses a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) that takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations.

Result: Validated on MultiDex grasping dataset using Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effectiveness for joint configuration estimation in AI-driven grasp planning, overcoming traditional IK limitations through machine learning.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous exploration with only monocular cameras remains largely unsolved, as existing methods typically require dense range sensors. There's a need for systems that can safely navigate large-scale unstructured 3D environments using only sparse visual data.

Method: Uses a two-module approach: (1) Mapping module handles sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and tracking obstacle position uncertainty; (2) Planning module manages free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. Adapts frontier-based exploration for sparse monocular data.

Result: Successfully achieves 3D monocular exploration in real-world unstructured outdoor environments - claimed as the first method to do so. Evaluated extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments with ablation studies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that frontier-based exploration is feasible with sparse monocular depth data when properly accounting for parallax requirements and textureless surfaces. The approach enables monocular-only robots to autonomously explore complex 3D environments.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration of unknown environments is a key capability for mobile robots, but it is largely unsolved for robots equipped with only a single monocular camera and no dense range sensors. In this paper, we present a novel approach to monocular vision-based exploration that can safely cover large-scale unstructured indoor and outdoor 3D environments by explicitly accounting for the properties of a sparse monocular SLAM frontend in both mapping and planning. The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first to achieve 3D monocular exploration in real-world unstructured outdoor environments. We open-source our implementation to support future research.

About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact.

Conclusion: Long-context Q-former effectively improves robot action confirmation and planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3 and leveraging full video context.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

TL;DR: METIS is a vision-language-action model for dexterous manipulation that integrates multi-source egocentric data and motion-aware dynamics to achieve superior performance in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity of large-scale action-annotated data for dexterous manipulation by leveraging human demonstrations, while addressing limitations of prior works like limited scenarios and visual gaps between human and robot data.

Method: Constructed EgoAtlas integrating human and robotic data under consistent action space, extracted motion-aware dynamics as compact motion representation, and built METIS VLA model integrating reasoning and acting in unified framework.

Result: Achieved highest average success rate in six real-world dexterous manipulation tasks, with superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: METIS represents a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation by effectively leveraging multi-source data and unified reasoning-acting framework.

Abstract: Building a generalist robot that can perceive, reason, and act across diverse tasks remains an open challenge, especially for dexterous manipulation. A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AMS is a unified policy framework that combines agile motion tracking with extreme balance maintenance for humanoid robots, using heterogeneous data sources and hybrid rewards to achieve both capabilities simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots need controllers that combine agility with robust balance, but existing methods are specialized - focusing on either dynamic skills or stability, compromising the other capability.

Method: Leverages heterogeneous data (human motion capture for agility + synthetic balance motions for stability), uses hybrid reward scheme with general tracking objectives and balance-specific priors, and adaptive learning with performance-driven sampling.

Result: A single policy can execute agile skills like dancing and running while performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, validated in simulation and on real Unitree G1 humanoid.

Conclusion: AMS presents a versatile control paradigm that successfully unifies dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy for humanoid applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to perform a wide range of tasks in human-centered environments, requiring controllers that combine agility with robust balance. Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications.

Conclusion: The integration of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation offers a comprehensive simulation pipeline that significantly enhances multi-objective decision making in autonomous robotic systems.

Abstract: The vector cost bimatrix game is a method for multi-objective decision making that enables autonomous robotic systems to optimize for multiple goals at once while avoiding worst-case scenarios in neglected objectives. We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

Motivation: Existing embodied benchmarks focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity.

Method: Uses 12 manually created Unity warehouse scenarios with dynamic objects and human movement, employing a PointGoal navigation pipeline that combines egocentric vision with global odometry, and introduces collision rate and warning rate metrics for safety evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLLMs reveals closed-source models maintain consistent advantage, but all agents show notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance, and active exploration.

Conclusion: Embodied research needs to move beyond passive perception toward tasks requiring stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environments.

Abstract: While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.

TL;DR: A brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework for continuous pursuit motion control in EEG-based BCIs, achieving 72% error reduction compared to existing methods by decoding acceleration-based motor representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based BCI wheelchair control systems are limited to discrete commands, but continuous pursuit control is essential for navigating complex environments and enabling natural mobility for users with motor impairments.

Method: Proposed a Bayesian inference framework that decodes embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations, using Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning on motor imagery EEG data.

Result: Reduced normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in session-accumulative transfer learning.

Conclusion: The approach supports embodied cognition theory and offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control by grounding EEG decoding in biological motion dynamics.

Abstract: Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an intuitive means for individuals with severe motor impairments to independently operate assistive robotic wheelchairs and navigate built environments. Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.

TL;DR: SPEAR-1 is a robotic foundation model that enhances 2D vision-language models with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance while using 20x fewer robot demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic foundation models built by fine-tuning 2D vision-language models lack 3D spatial reasoning required for embodied control in the 3D world, and collecting large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale.

Method: Enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations to train SPEAR-VLM (a 3D-aware VLM), then build SPEAR-1 by integrating grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control, trained on ~45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets.

Result: SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models like π₀-FAST and π₀.₅ while using 20x fewer robot demonstrations, demonstrating enhanced reliability in embodied control.

Conclusion: The proposed training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and boosts embodied control reliability beyond what's achievable with only robotic data, providing a scalable approach to building 3D-aware robotic foundation models.

Abstract: Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.

Result: Achieves competitive closed-loop performance on Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation.

Conclusion: MDG represents a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling that generalizes across multiple applications with improved efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.

Conclusion: HALO demonstrates effective real-time high-altitude aerial mapping and exploration capabilities, enabling autonomous mission execution in large-scale outdoor environments with natural language task specifications.

Abstract: We demonstrate real-time high-altitude aerial metric-semantic mapping and exploration using a monocular camera paired with a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.
