### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement on artificial text overlay detection using only <1,000 images, outperforming CNNs that need much more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge vision and language by exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, addressing the underexploited potential of LLMs in specialized visual tasks.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on artificial text overlay detection in images.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned on limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) achieved up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches demonstrate superior adaptability and data efficiency for real-world object detection tasks, providing actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation faces challenges with class imbalance and limited model generalization, requiring better loss functions and augmentation strategies.

Method: Used U-Net with focal loss parameter tuning and evaluated three data augmentation techniques (horizontal flip, rotation, scaling) on a public MRI dataset.

Result: Achieved 90% precision with focal loss, comparable to state-of-the-art results, with all code and results made publicly available.

Conclusion: Establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses memorization in text-to-image diffusion models by showing that initial noise samples affect when the denoising trajectory escapes memorization basins, and proposes strategies to adjust initial noise for earlier escape while maintaining prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often memorize and replicate training data, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Current approaches that defer classifier-free guidance (CFG) result in poor image-text alignment, creating a need for methods that promote earlier escape from memorization basins.

Method: The authors propose two mitigation strategies: collective and individual adjustment of initial noise samples to find configurations that encourage earlier escape from memorization basins during denoising, allowing CFG to be applied sooner.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment, demonstrating that initial noise manipulation can effectively mitigate memorization issues in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Initial noise samples play a crucial role in determining memorization escape timing, and strategic adjustment of these samples provides an effective solution to reduce memorization while maintaining generation quality in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Lepp√§lampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines gender representation biases in AI-generated occupational images from DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, finding both tools reinforce traditional gender stereotypes to varying degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI visualization research focuses on creation process and image quality, overlooking representational biases. As AI image tools become widely used, addressing harmful gender biases is essential for diverse representation in media and professional settings.

Method: Generated over 750 AI images of occupations using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, followed by thematic analysis to evaluate gender representation biases.

Result: Both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated occupational images, although to varying degrees. AI visualization tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.

Conclusion: The study proposes suggestions for practitioners, individuals, and researchers to increase representation when generating images with visible genders, emphasizing the need to address and mitigate harmful gender biases in AI-generated content.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR models suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions. A dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding reduces FLOPs by 20% and speeds up inference by 11% while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions.

Method: Introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router integrated into VAR with scale-aware thresholding that balances expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining image quality in VAR models.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised OOD detection method using epistemic uncertainty from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of GMM parameters in neural network feature space, outperforming predictive entropy methods without needing auxiliary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised OOD detection methods conflate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in-distribution regions as OOD. Supervised methods require auxiliary OOD datasets, which is impractical.

Method: Uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model parameters in deep neural network feature space to derive epistemic uncertainty, avoiding the need for auxiliary data or additional training stages.

Result: Achieves 18% improvement in AUROC, 22% increase in AUPRC, and 36% reduction in FPR95 (from 76% to 40%) compared to predictive entropy approaches on SemanticKITTI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed epistemic uncertainty-based approach effectively separates OOD objects from ambiguous in-distribution regions without requiring auxiliary OOD datasets, significantly outperforming existing uncertainty-based methods.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR is a hierarchical open-set classifier for human activity recognition that identifies known activities with high accuracy while rejecting unknown ones, and can localize unknown activities to the nearest hierarchical node.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between real-world activities and annotated datasets in HAR, and traditional classifiers fail to handle unseen activities properly. Additionally, activity classes have varying levels of similarity and hierarchical relationships.

Method: Organize activity classes into a structured hierarchy and develop Hi-OSCAR, which performs open-set classification while allowing unknown classes to be localized to the nearest internal node in the hierarchy.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for known activities while effectively rejecting unknown activities. A new dataset NFI_FARED with 19 activities from various contexts was also created.

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR enables more reliable HAR by handling unseen activities through hierarchical open-set classification, providing insights beyond binary known/unknown classification.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed an unsupervised clustering method for automated detection of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy patients, achieving high accuracy and strong correlation with surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, subjective, and labor-intensive, making automated detection methods critical for clinical use in identifying epileptogenic zones.

Method: Used unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events from time-frequency domain using S-transform, differentiating HFOs from spikes, background activity, and artifacts in ripple and fast ripple bands (80-500 Hz).

Result: Achieved 97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision, and 97.78% F-score on controlled dataset. In patients, showed 0.73 ratio between HFOs rates in resected vs non-resected contacts, correlating with surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: HFOs are promising biomarkers for epileptogenicity; removing HFOs (especially fast ripple) leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to recurrence, validating the clinical utility of automated detection.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes DINOv2's internal representations using SAEs, revealing functional specialization across tasks, geometric properties of learned concepts, and proposes a new Minkowski Representation Hypothesis based on convex mixtures of archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what DINOv2 actually perceives and the nature of its internal representations, moving beyond the Linear Representation Hypothesis to develop more accurate interpretability frameworks.

Method: Used Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create a 32,000-unit dictionary as interpretability backbone, analyzed downstream task recruitment patterns, studied geometry and statistics of learned concepts, and proposed Minkowski Representation Hypothesis based on convex mixtures.

Result: Found functional specialization: classification uses 'Elsewhere' concepts (learned negations), segmentation uses boundary detectors, depth estimation uses monocular depth cues. Representations are partly dense, locally connected, and organized beyond linear sparsity. Concepts form convex mixtures of archetypes.

Conclusion: Proposes Minkowski Representation Hypothesis where tokens are formed by convex mixtures of archetypes, grounded in conceptual spaces theory and attention mechanisms, providing better framework for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE is a physics-guided degradation-adaptive method for remote sensing image restoration that explicitly models degradation physics through a two-stage cascaded architecture, achieving superior performance across haze, noise, blur, and low-light restoration tasks with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one restoration methods overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, failing to effectively handle complex and heterogeneous degradations in remote sensing images caused by atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and imaging conditions.

Method: Two-stage cascaded architecture transforming degradation information from implicit features to explicit decision signals; employs Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) for comprehensive degradation analysis; uses physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies.

Result: Achieves superior performance across all four restoration tasks on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, MDRS-Landsat); substantially improves restoration quality while significantly reducing parameter count and computational complexity; outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PhyDAE effectively addresses heterogeneous degradations in remote sensing images through explicit physics-guided modeling, achieving optimal balance between performance and efficiency with remarkable computational gains compared to mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin is a unified camera-centric multimodal model that integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation for spatial understanding and scene creation from arbitrary viewpoints, treating camera as language to bridge modality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the isolation between camera-centric understanding and generation in spatial intelligence research, and create a unified model that can both interpret and create scenes from any viewpoint.

Method: Introduces a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. Uses both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps. Trained on Puffin-4M dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets with instruction tuning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. Generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks including spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance.

Conclusion: Puffin advances multimodal spatial intelligence research by unifying camera-centric understanding and generation, with plans to release code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to the research community.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Output Regularization (SOR), a transfer learning method that freezes internal network structures while using group lasso and L1 penalties to adapt models to specific data with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning freezes weights and adds task-specific layers, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and can cause overfitting with limited data.

Method: Freezes internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) and applies group lasso and L1 penalties to tailor models to specific data with minimal additional parameters.

Result: Achieved competitive results on three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR is a simple yet effective framework that enables better adaptation to domain-specific features while preventing overfitting in transfer learning with limited data.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal large language models focus on specific domains like planning or spatial understanding, lacking systematic evaluation of comprehensive embodied capabilities needed for physical world interaction.

Method: Created BEAR benchmark with 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories, then proposed BEAR-Agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning.

Result: Evaluation of 20 representative MLLMs revealed persistent limitations across all embodied capability domains. BEAR-Agent achieved 9.12% absolute gain and 17.5% relative improvement on GPT-5, and improved performance on embodied tasks in simulated environments.

Conclusion: BEAR provides a systematic framework for evaluating embodied capabilities in MLLMs, and BEAR-Agent demonstrates that integrating specialized vision models can substantially enhance MLLM performance across diverse embodied tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

### [15] [SAFER-AiD: Saccade-Assisted Foveal-peripheral vision Enhanced Reconstruction for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08761)
*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A biologically inspired defense framework that uses foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to mitigate adversarial attacks without requiring retraining of classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial defenses are computationally intensive, while the human visual system achieves inherent robustness through biological mechanisms like attention-guided sparse sampling and predictive coding.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning-guided saccades to capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, integrates them into reconstructed images through cortical filling-in, and processes them without retraining downstream classifiers.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show improved robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, with significantly reduced training overhead compared to other defense techniques.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise while preserving semantic integrity, enabling seamless integration with existing systems without retraining requirements.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

*Xiaohui Li,Shaobin Zhuang,Shuo Cao,Yang Yang,Yuandong Pu,Qi Qin,Siqi Luo,Bin Fu,Yihao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR introduces a holistic framework that overcomes key challenges in using Linear Attention for photorealistic image super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution rely on self-attention with quadratic complexity (O(N¬≤)), creating computational bottlenecks. Linear Attention offers O(N) complexity but has been hindered by training instability, perception-distortion trade-offs, and guidance challenges.

Method: The framework uses: 1) Knee point-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) to resolve training instability, 2) SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to mitigate perception-distortion trade-off, and 3) TAG guidance paradigm based on "precision-over-volume" principle.

Result: LinearSR simultaneously delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. The core diffusion forward pass achieves SOTA-level speed, while overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive.

Conclusion: This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline for non-invasive kƒÅkƒÅ parrot re-identification using key frame extraction from video recordings at feeders, combining object detection, blur detection, and clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife monitoring methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers non-invasive alternatives for accurate animal recognition and re-identification to improve population monitoring.

Method: Unsupervised pipeline combining YOLO and Grounding DINO for object detection, optical flow blur detection, DINOv2 for image encoding, and clustering methods to extract representative key frames from video recordings at custom feeders.

Result: The proposed key frame selection methods yield image collections that achieve high accuracy in kƒÅkƒÅ re-identification, providing foundation for research in diverse environments.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach provides valuable non-invasive alternative to physical tagging for wildlife monitoring, contributing to fresh approaches in ecology and conservation biology with applications for threatened species like kƒÅkƒÅ parrots.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

### [19] [Q-Router: Agentic Video Quality Assessment with Expert Model Routing and Artifact Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08789)
*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router is an agentic framework for universal video quality assessment that uses vision-language models as routers to dynamically select and ensemble appropriate expert models based on video content, achieving superior generalization and interpretability across diverse video types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models suffer from poor generalization across different content types (UGC, short-form videos, AIGC), limited interpretability, and lack of extensibility to novel use cases.

Method: Multi-tier model routing system that integrates diverse expert models and employs VLMs as real-time routers to dynamically reason and ensemble the most appropriate experts based on input video semantics. Includes a heavy tier with spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability.

Result: Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on various benchmarks, substantially improves generalization and interpretability, excels on Q-Bench-Video benchmark, and capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts.

Conclusion: Q-Router shows promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems and has potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models due to its agentic design that combines complementary strengths of specialized experts.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified Med-VQA framework with multi-level modality alignment, hard negative mining, and gated cross-attention that achieves SOTA performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VQA methods lack unified modality alignment, under-explore hard negatives, and may introduce irrelevant knowledge through fusion techniques.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) unified multi-level modality alignment using contrastive learning and optimal transport, (2) hard negative mining with soft labels, (3) gated cross-attention module for knowledge integration.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses modality alignment, hard negative mining, and knowledge integration challenges in Med-VQA.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR accelerates video super-resolution by skipping computation on low-detail regions identified from low-resolution input, achieving up to 60% faster latency with no perceptible quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based super-resolution is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos, while many video regions are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement.

Method: Propose SkipSR framework that identifies low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input and skips computation on them entirely, only super-resolving areas that require refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality, preserving perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models.

Conclusion: SkipSR provides a simple yet effective strategy to significantly reduce computation in video super-resolution while maintaining perceptual quality, enabling better scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video

*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe is a training-free framework that adapts image-based vision-language models for video understanding through dynamic compression and question decomposition to address perception bottlenecks and token overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending image-pretrained vision-language models to video domain is challenging due to dense temporal visual inputs that exceed image model capacities, specifically facing perception bottlenecks and token overload issues.

Method: Proposes D-CoDe with two components: 1) Dynamic compression through adaptive frame selection and content-aware spatial token aggregation to reduce redundancy while preserving information, and 2) Question decomposition that reformulates queries into sub-questions to guide model focus on different video aspects.

Result: D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks and shows strong performance on challenging long-video tasks, demonstrating comprehensive video understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in adapting image-based VLMs to video domain without requiring additional training, showing potential for handling complex video-language tasks.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLK proposes a fast open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method using label-guided knowledge distillation to avoid noisy 2D mappings and accelerate inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images for classification using VLMs, which introduces noise from occlusions and incurs high computational costs during inference.

Method: Design a teacher model that extracts high-quality 2D CLIP embeddings with visibility and viewpoint diversity, then distill this knowledge into a 3D student model using label-guided distillation to directly classify instances from point clouds.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 with AP50 score of 35.7, while running 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods.

Conclusion: FOLK successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling direct 3D instance classification through knowledge distillation, significantly improving both accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

*Ronan John,Anis Chihoub,Ryan Meegan,Gina Sidelli,Jeffery Neyhart,Peter Oudemans,Kristin Dana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised vision transformer method for monitoring cranberry crop growth using time-lapse imagery without manual annotations, enabling growth prediction and variety differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual change monitoring in cranberry farming is time-consuming, and existing deep learning approaches require tedious hand-annotations and produce hard-to-interpret features.

Method: Fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) with a two-fold self-supervised pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn latent space for time-lapse plant evolution, creating interpretable 2D temporal tracks.

Result: The method successfully creates interpretable time-series models that can predict growth over time and distinguish temporal differences between cranberry varieties, with a novel dataset of 8 varieties observed 52 times over 4 months.

Conclusion: The self-supervised ViT approach provides an interpretable, annotation-free solution for crop growth monitoring that is generalizable to other crops and applications.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP is a vision-language model that uses an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on hyperbolic spaces to simultaneously capture hierarchical relationships within concept families and compositional relationships across different concepts, outperforming single-space approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle to simultaneously represent hierarchical structures within concept families (e.g., dog ‚â§ mammal ‚â§ animal) and compositional relationships across different concepts (e.g., 'a dog in a car' ‚â§ dog, car). While hyperbolic space efficiently captures hierarchy, its suitability for compositionality remains unclear.

Method: PHyCLIP employs an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors. Intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, while cross-family composition is captured by the ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-product metric, analogous to Boolean algebra.

Result: Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

Conclusion: PHyCLIP successfully resolves the dilemma of simultaneously representing hierarchical and compositional semantic structures by combining hyperbolic spaces with an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-product metric, providing improved performance and interpretability over existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans is a novel transfer attack framework that improves adversarial example transferability across segmentation models by dividing inputs into local regions and remapping semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples for perturbation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for segmentation models have poor transferability due to complex contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models, resulting in unsatisfactory transfer success rates.

Method: The framework divides input samples into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which replace original samples for perturbation optimization while retaining only local semantic information rather than global information.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets with four segmentation models and three backbone networks show SegTrans significantly improves transfer success rates by an average of 8.55% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving computational efficiency by over 100%.

Conclusion: SegTrans effectively addresses the transferability challenge in segmentation model attacks by leveraging local semantic information remapping, achieving superior performance without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [27] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVP is a defense method against knowledge distillation attacks for image restoration models that uses singular value decomposition to perturb feature maps, disrupting student learning while maintaining teacher performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation attacks threaten deep model IP, but existing defenses from classification don't work well for image restoration due to its continuous, high-dimensional outputs requiring spatial coherence.

Method: Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP) applies SVD to teacher's internal feature maps, amplifies top-k singular values to inject structured high-frequency perturbations that disrupt distillation alignment.

Result: ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75% across five restoration tasks, with negligible impact on teacher performance, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: ASVP provides an effective practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation attacks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

*Zixi Yang,Jiapeng Li,Muxi Diao,Yinuo Jing,Kongming Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ro-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on dynamic out-of-distribution counterfactual video test sets, showing current models degrade significantly on manipulated content but can be improved through counterfactual fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show strong performance on video understanding tasks but their robustness against manipulated video content remains unexplored, creating a need to evaluate how they handle counterfactual scenarios.

Method: Created Ro-Bench benchmark with high-quality, diverse video data by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions to generate counterfactual content. Evaluated 8 recent video MLLMs and fine-tuned them with counterfactual data.

Result: Current MLLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Fine-tuning with counterfactual data improved performance by 21.73% on Ro-Bench and 12.78% across 20 tasks in MVBench dataset.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data is highly effective for enhancing MLLMs' video understanding robustness, demonstrating the importance of testing and improving models against manipulated content.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

### [29] [Hamba: Single-view 3D Hand Reconstruction with Graph-guided Bi-Scanning Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09646)
*Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Wenbo Gou,Francisco Vicente Carrasco,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hamba is a novel graph-guided Mamba framework for 3D hand reconstruction that uses graph-guided bidirectional scanning with fewer tokens to efficiently model spatial relationships between joints, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods for 3D hand reconstruction don't fully achieve robust and accurate performance due to inefficient modeling of spatial relations between joints in articulated hand motion.

Method: Proposes a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints using 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods, and integrates state space features with global features through a fusion module.

Result: Achieves PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND benchmark, and holds Rank 1 in two Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction.

Conclusion: Hamba's graph-guided Mamba framework effectively bridges graph learning and state space modeling, enabling efficient learning of spatial relationships between joints and significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two
Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. Project Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an object-focused data augmentation framework for animal health monitoring that uses segmentation, transformations, and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic scenes, improving detection performance in data-scarce agricultural settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring due to limited data availability and scene-specific challenges like small, occluded, or partially visible animals, where transfer learning fails due to lack of farm-specific datasets.

Method: Segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes for enhanced animal detection and monitoring.

Result: Initial experiments show superior performance compared to baseline models on animal detection tasks using the augmented dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time animal health monitoring in data-scarce scenarios by generating domain-specific data, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

*Yifan Li,Zhenghao Chen,Ziheng Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruipu Luo,Can Zhang,Zhentao He,Yufei Zhan,Wayne Xin Zhao,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisTANCE benchmark showing LVLMs have limited visual estimation precision, proposes Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) to enable token-rich perception, achieving 8.0% to 64.7% improvement on high-precision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs treat visual perception as one-shot output without modeling perceptual processes, limiting their estimation precision despite advances in inference-time scaling for reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposed Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm that decomposes complex perception into intermediate sub-problems, combined with reinforcement learning to enable token-rich perception.

Result: PTS significantly improves perception accuracy from 8.0% to 64.7% on DisTANCE benchmark, generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, and surprisingly enhances both reasoning and real-world perception even with synthetic data.

Conclusion: PTS enables perception to benefit from inference-time scaling by introducing more perception-related tokens and increasing attention to image tokens, addressing fundamental limitations in current LVLM perception paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints is a framework that enhances mmWave-based 3D pose estimation by adding joint descriptors that explicitly indicate sensing likelihood and prediction reliability, improving both interpretability and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often cause models to rely too heavily on statistical priors rather than actual sensor data, which degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition.

Method: The mmJoints framework augments pre-trained mmWave-based 3D pose estimators with additional joint descriptors that estimate the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location, making model bias explicit rather than trying to mitigate it.

Result: Extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings show mmJoints estimates descriptors with error rate below 4.2%, improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: mmJoints successfully addresses the over-reliance on statistical priors in mmWave pose estimation by making bias explicit through joint descriptors, leading to improved interpretability, joint position accuracy, and downstream task performance.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR is an efficient hierarchical scheduling framework for image retrieval that improves accuracy and reduces computation by 3.5x compared to existing multi-vector retrieval systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional retrieval approaches in multimodal LLMs suffer from limited accuracy, and even recent multi-vector retrieval methods have sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency due to poor query-image object alignment and redundant fine-grained image segments.

Method: Proposes HiMIR framework with: 1) hierarchical paradigm using multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment, 2) redundancy minimization through cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to reduce unnecessary matching computation, and 3) automatic parameter configuration for different datasets.

Result: HiMIR achieves substantial accuracy improvements and reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over existing multi-vector retrieval systems.

Conclusion: The HiMIR framework effectively addresses accuracy and efficiency limitations in image retrieval for multimodal LLMs through hierarchical scheduling and redundancy minimization techniques.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

### [34] [Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035)
*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DGLSS-NL, a new task for domain generalization in LiDAR 3D semantic segmentation under noisy labels, and proposes DuNe - a dual-view framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors, which degrades segmentation accuracy and is amplified under domain shifts. While noisy-label learning is well-studied for images, it remains unexplored for 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization due to the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds.

Method: Proposed DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. The approach adapts noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation.

Result: Achieved 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with overall Arithmetic Mean of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean of 48.50%, demonstrating robust domain generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed DuNe framework effectively addresses the novel DGLSS-NL task, showing state-of-the-art performance and robust domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation under noisy labels, overcoming limitations of existing methods that adapt poorly to LiDAR data.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HandEval, the first quality assessment model specifically for generated hand regions in text-to-image models, addressing structural distortions and unrealistic textures in complex local regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating accurate details in complex local regions like human hands, exhibiting structural distortions and unrealistic textures. Existing quality assessment methods neglect hand regions, limiting downstream applications.

Method: Introduces HandPair dataset with 48k high- and low-quality hand pairs for training without manual annotation. Develops HandEval model leveraging MLLM capabilities and incorporating hand keypoint prior knowledge for strong hand quality perception.

Result: HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. When integrated into generation and detection pipelines, it significantly enhances hand realism and detection accuracy respectively.

Conclusion: HandEval effectively addresses the neglected problem of hand quality assessment in T2I models, demonstrating universal effectiveness in downstream applications including image generation optimization and AIGC detection.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

TL;DR: An image-based anomaly detection framework using vision transformers for monitoring flexible microelectrode implantation in brain cortex, with progressive granularity patch feature sampling and feature channel selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible microelectrode implantation is challenging due to deformable fiber-like structure and interaction with critical bio-tissue, requiring careful monitoring for reliability and safety.

Method: Uses microscopic cameras and vision transformers with progressive granularity patch feature sampling to address sensitivity-tolerance trade-off, plus feature channel selection from ViT features for better descriptors.

Result: Effectiveness validated with image datasets collected from the implantation system.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully monitors FME implantation at four checkpoints using optimized vision transformer features.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAChroma is the first defensive method that adds imperceptible perturbations to grayscale images to prevent unauthorized AI colorization, protecting copyright of manga and films.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI colorization poses copyright infringement risks for monochrome content like manga and films, but no effective prevention methods exist.

Method: PAChroma optimizes imperceptible perturbations using Laplacian filter for perceptual quality, with diverse input transformations for transferability and robustness against post-processing.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru show PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining visual appearance.

Conclusion: This is the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, enabling copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SilvaScenes is a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images, collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec with 1476 trees from 24 species. Benchmarking shows tree segmentation achieves 67.65% mAP while species classification remains challenging at 35.69% mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are inadequate for forest robotics as they focus on urban settings or limited species, while forest management requires advanced perception capabilities for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and automation in complex natural environments with occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation.

Method: Created SilvaScenes dataset with under-canopy images collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, featuring 1476 trees from 24 species with expert annotations. Benchmarked modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation to evaluate dataset relevance and challenge.

Result: Tree segmentation performed relatively well with top mAP of 67.65%, but species classification proved significantly more challenging with mAP of only 35.69%, highlighting the difficulty of fine-grained species identification in complex forest environments.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes addresses the gap in forest robotics datasets and demonstrates that while tree detection is feasible, accurate species classification remains a major challenge that requires further research and improved perception systems for forest management applications.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

TL;DR: SJD2 accelerates autoregressive text-to-image models by enabling parallel token generation through speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding, reducing inference time while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding requiring thousands of forward passes per image.

Method: Introduces speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding with next-clean-token prediction, fine-tuning models to accept noise-perturbed embeddings and predict clean tokens, enabling parallel generation through iterative denoising in embedding space.

Result: The method significantly reduces model forward passes while maintaining visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: SJD2 provides an effective framework for accelerating autoregressive text-to-image generation through parallel token decoding while preserving output quality.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysToolBench is the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of physical tools through a VQA dataset with 1,000+ image-text pairs across three difficulty levels: tool recognition, understanding, and creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify MLLMs' true understanding of physical tools, as tool mastery is essential for general-purpose intelligent agents to achieve true versatility in interacting with the physical world.

Method: Created a Visual Question Answering dataset with three difficulty levels: Tool Recognition (identifying primary function), Tool Understanding (grasping operational principles), and Tool Creation (fashioning new tools from surrounding objects).

Result: Evaluation of 32 MLLMs (proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and VLA backbones) revealed significant deficiencies in tool understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have substantial gaps in physical tool comprehension, highlighting the need for improved tool understanding in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,

### [41] [On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008)
*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies uncertain visual tokens in vision encoders as a key cause of object hallucination in large vision-language models, and proposes a method to detect and mask these uncertain tokens to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs - where models generate descriptions of objects not present in input images - remains a critical challenge. The authors argue that uncertain visual tokens within the vision encoder contribute significantly to this problem.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) A proxy method using adversarial perturbations to efficiently identify uncertain visual tokens by detecting large representation deviations in early vision encoder layers, and 2) Masking these uncertain tokens during self-attention in middle vision encoder layers to suppress their influence on visual encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can work synergistically with other existing techniques.

Conclusion: The approach provides a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying only the vision encoder, addressing the root cause through uncertainty identification and suppression.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Feng Zhao,Pengyang Ling,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiang Wei,Hu Yu,Jie Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-informed decoding strategy for autoregressive image generation that improves quality and speed by using dynamic temperature control and entropy-aware speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive image generation models have sampling issues due to image tokens having lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution compared to text tokens.

Method: Two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves higher generation quality with faster synthesis speed, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-informed decoding strategy effectively enhances both generation quality and sampling speed across multiple benchmarks and diverse AR image generation models.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

*Junhyeok Lee,Hyunwoong Kim,Hyungjin Chung,Heeseong Eom,Joon Jang,Chul-Ho Sohn,Kyu Sung Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel post-training framework for latent diffusion models (LDMs) in medical image-to-image translation that incorporates lesion-aware pixel space objectives to enhance image quality and lesion delineation, particularly for brain CT-to-MRI translation in stroke patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDMs are efficient but may compromise pixel-level details crucial for medical images, especially small lesions that are clinically significant. This limitation affects diagnostic reliability in applications like stroke diagnosis where accurate lesion reconstruction is critical.

Method: Proposed a post-training framework for LDMs that incorporates lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. The approach is evaluated on brain CT-to-MRI translation for acute ischemic stroke patients using a dataset of 817 patients.

Result: The framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.

Conclusion: The post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and shows substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient framework for training unimodal 3D-CNNs using multimodal knowledge transfer for dynamic hand gesture recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance without explicit multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve unimodal network performance by embedding multimodal knowledge during training, rather than relying on explicit multimodal combination at test time.

Method: Separate networks per modality with collaborative learning using spatiotemporal semantic alignment (SSA) loss and focal regularization to prevent negative knowledge transfer.

Result: Improved test time recognition accuracy for unimodal networks and state-of-the-art performance on various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively transfers multimodal knowledge to unimodal networks, enabling better performance without requiring multimodal inputs during inference.

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sparse representation-based classification (SRC) by leveraging deep learning to learn more robust features and better sparse representations than traditional SRC methods.

Method: Proposed network combines a convolutional autoencoder for feature learning with a fully-connected layer between encoder and decoder to find sparse representations, which are then used for classification.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show the proposed method achieves better classification results than state-of-the-art SRC methods.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit is a state space modeling framework for point cloud normal estimation that uses attention-driven hierarchical feature fusion and patch-wise state space modeling to capture fine-grained geometric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal estimation methods struggle with modeling fine-grained geometric structures, and current Mamba-based approaches focus mainly on global shape understanding while neglecting local geometric details.

Method: Proposes Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) to fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, and Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively capturing fine-grained geometric structures for improved point cloud normal estimation.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Motivation: UAV applications in military reconnaissance and environmental monitoring require accurate multi-object tracking, but face challenges from complex backgrounds, small targets, occlusions and interactions.

Method: Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework with Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module for motion/appearance modeling, and JPTrack tracking algorithm to reduce ID switches and fragmentation.

Result: Significantly improves MOT continuity and stability while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: Provides strong support for advancing UAV detection and tracking technologies by effectively addressing key challenges in multi-object tracking.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: Dense2MoE transforms dense Diffusion Transformers into Mixture of Experts structure, reducing activated parameters by 60% while maintaining performance, outperforming pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models have large parameter sizes causing substantial inference overhead, and aggressive pruning leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity.

Method: Replace FFNs in DiT Blocks with MoE layers (62.5% reduction in activated FFN parameters), propose Mixture of Blocks for selective activation, and use multi-step distillation pipeline with Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss.

Result: Reduced activated parameters by 60% while maintaining original performance, surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation by preserving model capacity through structured sparsification via MoE transformation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology

from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel

Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets are costly, biased, and hard to scale, while existing synthetic data lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.

Method: Object-centric composition strategy that pastes synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting.

Result: Models trained on 100K SOS images outperform those on larger real datasets: +10.9 AP on LVIS detection, +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO grounding. Augmentation yields +3.83 APrare on LVIS and +6.59 AP with 1% COCO data.

Conclusion: SOS enables controllable dataset construction, improves generalization in low-data settings, and supports targeted data generation for challenging visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated data for rare or atypical cell morphologies in computational pathology, where manual annotation is costly and labor-intensive.

Method: Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) that conditions generation on cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal/vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, integrated via multi-head cross-attention.

Result: Synthetic images closely match real data with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings; incorporation of synthetic samples (e.g., columnar cells) significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on targeted cell types.

Conclusion: Multimodal diffusion-based augmentation effectively enriches datasets and improves robustness/generalizability of cell/nuclei segmentation models, paving the way for broader generative model applications in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

TL;DR: PSepT is a new polar separable transform that overcomes computational and numerical limitations of classical orthogonal moments like Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments by enabling independent radial-angular processing through tensor-product construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based image representations suffer from high computational complexity (O(n¬≥N¬≤) to O(n‚Å∂N¬≤)), numerical instability at large orders, and poor condition number scaling (O(N‚Å¥)), which limits their practical application in computer vision.

Method: PSepT uses a separable orthogonal transform with tensor-product construction combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing through complete kernel factorization.

Result: PSepT achieves O(N¬≤ log N) computational complexity, O(N¬≤) memory requirements, and O(‚àöN) condition number scaling - representing exponential improvements. It demonstrates better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance while preserving exact reconstruction.

Conclusion: PSepT enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications through its separable framework that maintains orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces training feature attribution, which links test predictions to specific regions in training images, providing joint analysis of input features and influential training examples for better model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque systems that need better explainability methods. Existing approaches only attribute predictions to either input features or training examples separately, but both perspectives should be studied jointly to improve trust and accountability.

Method: The paper proposes training feature attribution, which connects test-time predictions to specific regions within specific training images, providing a more comprehensive view of model behavior.

Result: Experiments on vision datasets show that training feature attribution provides fine-grained, test-specific explanations. It identifies harmful examples that cause misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations (like patch-based shortcuts) that conventional attribution methods miss.

Conclusion: Training feature attribution offers new insights into deep model inner workings by jointly analyzing input features and training examples, exposing issues that traditional methods fail to detect.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline that provides navigation assistance without requiring patient CT scans, trained only on phantom data with good generalization to real procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bronchoscopy navigation methods require CT scans and additional sensors, which involve extra setup and training. Topological localization with generic airway models can sufficiently assist surgeons without needing precise metric localization.

Method: Image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline trained exclusively on phantom data, eliminating the need for expensive real data labeling while maintaining good generalization capabilities.

Result: The approach surpasses existing methods, particularly showing strong performance on real data test sequences despite being trained only on phantom data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides effective bronchoscopy navigation assistance without requiring patient-specific CT scans, reducing setup complexity while maintaining good accuracy through phantom-trained models that generalize well to real procedures.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

TL;DR: A novel method for instance-level recognition that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains without real images, enabling efficient training of foundation models and improving retrieval performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level recognition faces challenges in creating large-scale annotated datasets due to its fine-grained nature, limiting real-world applicability across domains.

Method: Synthetically generate diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds to form a large-scale training set, without relying on any real images.

Result: Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains.

Conclusion: The approach offers an efficient alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where only domain names are needed as input, enabling wide real-world applications.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

### [56] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO is a novel object detection framework that goes beyond traditional open-set detection by categorizing unknown objects into meaningful coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy, rather than treating all unknowns as a single class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors are limited by closed-world assumptions and treat all unknown objects as a single 'Unknown' class, which is insufficient for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving where different types of unknowns require different responses.

Method: TARO uses a sparsemax-based head for objectness modeling, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component for auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships to categorize unknown objects into coarse parent categories.

Result: Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduces confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieves competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Conclusion: TARO successfully bridges the gap in open-set detection by providing more descriptive categorization of unknown objects, enhancing decision-making in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim K√ºchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Video Depth Anything (oVDA) enables real-time monocular depth estimation by adapting LLM techniques like feature caching and frame masking, achieving 42 FPS on A100 and 20 FPS on Jetson edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Depth Anything (VDA) requires batch processing which prevents real-time online deployment, especially on edge devices with limited VRAM.

Method: Employ Large Language Model techniques including caching latent features during inference and masking frames during training to enable online processing.

Result: oVDA outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in accuracy and VRAM usage, running at 42 FPS on A100 and 20 FPS on Jetson edge devices.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables real-time monocular depth estimation suitable for edge deployment with efficient VRAM usage and high frame rates.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive baseline study comparing 7 deep learning approaches for cricket shot classification, revealing significant performance gaps between literature claims and practical results, with the best model achieving 92.25% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket shot classification from video is challenging due to spatial-temporal feature modeling needs, and there's a gap between reported academic performance and practical implementation results that needs systematic investigation.

Method: Systematically evaluated 7 deep learning approaches across 4 paradigms: CNN-LSTM, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning, and EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark using PyTorch Lightning with MLOps practices.

Result: Found significant performance gaps - previous papers claimed 93-99.2% accuracy but re-implementations achieved only 46.0-57.7%. Modern EfficientNet-B0 with GRU achieved 92.25% accuracy, showing substantial improvements with modern architectures.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation protocols are critically important in sports video analysis research, and modern architectures with systematic optimization can achieve much better performance than previously reported results.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

### [59] [Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200)
*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multimodal dataset (DAAD-X) and Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) framework for interpretable driver intent prediction in autonomous driving systems, demonstrating that transformer models provide better interpretability than CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous driving systems interact more with humans, interpretability of decision-making becomes crucial for safety. Current deep learning systems lack understanding of underlying representations and causal reasoning for driver decisions.

Method: Created DAAD-X dataset with hierarchical textual explanations from driver eye-gaze and ego-vehicle perspective. Proposed VCBM framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations without post-hoc techniques. Used transformer-based models and introduced multilabel t-SNE visualization.

Result: Transformer-based models showed greater interpretability than CNN-based models. The VCBM framework successfully generated coherent explanations for driver intent prediction. Multilabel t-SNE visualization effectively illustrated disentanglement and causal correlation among explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances interpretable driver intent prediction in autonomous driving systems, with transformer models outperforming CNNs in interpretability while maintaining coherent explanation generation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

### [60] [Cattle-CLIP: A Multimodal Framework for Cattle Behaviour Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09203)
*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP is a multimodal deep learning framework that adapts CLIP for cattle behavior recognition using semantic cues and temporal integration, achieving 96.1% accuracy on six indoor behaviors with strong few-shot learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cattle behavior monitoring is crucial for animal health and productivity, but existing video-based methods face challenges with data scarcity and domain gaps between pre-trained models and real-world surveillance footage.

Method: Adapts CLIP by adding temporal integration module, uses tailored data augmentation and specialized text prompts to address domain gap, and evaluates in both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios.

Result: Achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviors, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating. Demonstrates robust generalization in few-shot scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: Cattle-CLIP highlights the potential of multimodal learning for agricultural and animal behavior analysis, particularly for data-scarce behavior recognition tasks in livestock monitoring.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture for 3D reconstruction in photon-efficient imaging, with specific designs for spatio-temporal transient measurements. It introduces two embodiments (TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS) that outperform existing methods on both synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transient measurements in photon-efficient imaging face challenges in 3D reconstruction due to low quantum efficiency of sensors and high noise levels, especially for long-range or complex scenes.

Method: The proposed TRT architecture features two key attention designs: spatio-temporal self-attention encoders that explore local and global correlations by processing input features at different scales, and spatio-temporal cross attention decoders that integrate local and global features in token space.

Result: Extensive experiments show that both TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. The authors also contribute a large-scale synthetic LOS dataset and real-world NLOS measurements.

Conclusion: TRT provides a generic and effective architecture for 3D reconstruction in photon-efficient imaging, with demonstrated superiority over existing methods across different imaging scenarios and data types.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI enables infinite-length video generation with high temporal consistency and controllable storylines by using Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, which trains the model to correct its own errors through closed-loop recycling of self-generated mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-video methods suffer from accumulated errors and homogeneous scenes due to the discrepancy between training on clean data and testing on self-generated outputs. The fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to this hypothesis gap.

Method: Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning that recycles Diffusion Transformer's self-generated errors into supervisory prompts through: (i) injecting historical errors to simulate error-accumulated trajectories, (ii) efficient one-step bidirectional integration for error calculation, (iii) dynamic error banking in replay memory across timesteps.

Result: SVI scales videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, maintains compatibility with diverse conditions (audio, skeleton, text), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks covering consistent, creative, and conditional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning effectively bridges the training-testing gap, enabling infinite video generation with high temporal consistency and versatile conditioning while eliminating accumulated error issues that plague existing methods.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM is a cross-domain sequential recommendation framework that uses LLMs to generate semantic tags from item metadata, then fuses these tags with other features to create enhanced item representations and model user preferences across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain sequential recommendation systems need to capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized experiences across diverse services like books, movies, and retail products.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate domain-aware semantic tags from item titles/descriptions, fuses tag embeddings with item IDs and textual/visual features, and employs a Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention mechanism to model user preferences within and across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on four large e-commerce datasets show TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration.

Conclusion: The approach highlights LLMs' potential to advance intelligent, user-centric services in consumer electronics by effectively capturing complex and evolving consumer interests across domains.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer

TL;DR: This paper proposes HMVDx, a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework using Multimodal Large Language Models for low-cost shoulder disorder diagnosis from consumer-grade videos, achieving 79.6% accuracy improvement over direct video diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shoulder disorders are common worldwide with high incidence rates, but early diagnosis is challenging in resource-scarce regions. There's an urgent need for low-cost, scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions.

Method: Proposes HMVDx framework that divides action understanding and disease diagnosis tasks between two MLLMs. Uses videos from consumer-grade devices and introduces a novel Usability Index metric based on medical decision-making logic.

Result: HMVDx achieved 79.6% higher accuracy in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries compared to direct video diagnosis methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential for low-cost MLLMs in medical applications, providing a technical contribution for future research on video understanding in healthcare.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lag behind specialized models in image privacy prediction accuracy despite being more resource-intensive, though they show higher robustness to image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation comparing large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against specialized models for image privacy prediction, as current trends favor VLMs without considering performance ceilings of purpose-built models.

Method: Established a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification, evaluated top-3 open-source VLMs using task-aligned prompts, and compared their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.

Result: VLMs currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy despite their resource-intensive nature (high parameter count and slower inference), but exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: Specialized models still outperform VLMs in image privacy prediction accuracy, challenging the trend of favoring generic VLMs over purpose-built solutions, though VLMs offer advantages in robustness.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapGeo is a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into textual captions to improve MLLMs' geometric reasoning, achieving substantial performance gains (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B from 8.6% to 59.0%). CapGeo-Bench provides a dataset and evaluation metric for assessing geometric captioning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric reasoning remains a major challenge for MLLMs, with advanced systems struggling despite strong textual reasoning abilities. The bottleneck appears to be understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself, suggesting that converting visual content to text could bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into concise textual captions. Also proposes CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 figure-caption pairs with a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates with downstream performance.

Result: Substantial improvements in geometric reasoning: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improved from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, Claude-Opus-4 from 44.8% to 73.0%. The keypoint-based evaluation metric strongly correlates with downstream CapGeo performance.

Conclusion: Caption-assisted reasoning provides a promising pathway for advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs by bridging visual and textual modalities, with the framework and benchmark enabling systematic evaluation and improvement of geometric captioning abilities.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated

TL;DR: Using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to filter out questions likely to cause hallucinations significantly improves accuracy of vision-language models in medical VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic image-based visual question answering by detecting and filtering out questions that are likely to generate hallucinations.

Method: Evaluated DSE on two medical datasets using GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 models. Generated multiple responses per question with temperature 1.0, grouped meaning-equivalent responses using bidirectional entailment checks, computed DSE from semantic cluster frequencies, and filtered questions with DSE > 0.3.

Result: Baseline accuracy was 51.7% (GPT-4o) and 54.8% (GPT-4.1). After filtering high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy improved to 76.3% (GPT-4o) and 63.8% (GPT-4.1), with both improvements statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion: DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency, significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy, and offers a practical filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

*Ming Dai,Sen Yang,Boqiang Duan,Wankou Yang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding and Referring Video Object Segmentation using moment-centric sampling and bidirectional propagation for improved temporal reasoning and tracking stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for RefVOS either use handcrafted heuristics that miss temporal cues or rely on external keyframe models that increase system complexity. There's a need for a more integrated solution that naturally incorporates temporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with: 1) TSG paradigm using FIND token for key moment identification via temporal token similarity matching, 2) Moment-Centric Sampling strategy that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential frames, 3) Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation for tracking stability using relevant moments as start points.

Result: The method avoids external timestamp encodings and external keyframe models while preserving motion details and global context. It mitigates accumulated errors in tracking through dynamic anchor updates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an integrated solution for RefVOS that jointly handles temporal sentence grounding and segmentation, eliminating the need for external components while improving temporal reasoning and tracking performance.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

### [70] [Spotlight on Token Perception for Multimodal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09285)
*Siyuan Huang,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Yun Luo,Zefeng He,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPPO is a novel policy gradient algorithm that uses token perception to enhance multimodal reasoning in LVLMs by focusing on visually-dependent tokens and reweighting trajectory advantages based on visual dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods in multimodal reasoning overlook the importance of visual perception during optimization, particularly the varying visual dependency of different tokens in reasoning processes.

Method: VPPO analyzes token perception (visual dependency of generated tokens) in CoT processes, then reweights trajectory advantages by overall visual dependency and focuses policy updates only on perceptually pivotal tokens.

Result: VPPO achieves substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models across eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, with consistent effectiveness at 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The study establishes a token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR and presents an effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance LVLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

*Tejaswi V. Panchagnula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human visual gaze follows Levy walk dynamics similar to animal foraging, optimized for efficient information search in visual environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements and explore if human visual exploration follows statistical laws analogous to natural foraging, with applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiment with 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images, recording over 4 million gaze points using high-speed eye tracker. Analyzed gaze trajectory statistics and trained a CNN to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone.

Result: Human gaze trajectory follows Levy walk dynamics similar to animal foraging. CNN model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key gaze behavior components are learnable from visual structure alone.

Conclusion: Human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging, suggesting the eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner, opening avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a standardized evaluation framework for interactive medical image segmentation to address inconsistent and unrealistic evaluation practices, and evaluates state-of-the-art algorithms across diverse clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for interactive medical image segmentation are inconsistent and clinically unrealistic, which hinders fair algorithm comparison and misrepresents real-world performance.

Method: Developed a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for standardized evaluation pipelines to assess state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks.

Result: Key findings include: (i) minimizing information loss during user interactions is critical for robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming boosts robustness and convergence, (iii) performance drops when validation differs from training, (iv) 2D methods work well with slab-like images but 3D context helps with large/irregular targets, (v) non-medical models degrade with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation frameworks are essential for fair comparison of interactive segmentation algorithms, and the proposed methodology reveals important insights about algorithm performance across diverse clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

*Ruyi Xu,Guangxuan Xiao,Yukang Chen,Liuning He,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM is a vision-language model designed for real-time understanding of infinite video streams, using a unified framework that maintains compact KV cache with attention sinks and token windows, achieving stable performance at up to 8 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs face challenges with infinite video streams due to quadratic computational costs from full attention and poor performance on long videos, while sliding window methods break coherence or suffer from high latency.

Method: A unified framework aligning training with streaming inference, maintaining compact KV cache by reusing attention sinks, recent vision tokens, and recent text tokens, with SFT strategy using full attention on overlapped video chunks to mimic inference patterns.

Result: Achieves 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini on Inf-Streams-Eval benchmark, maintains stable real-time performance at 8 FPS on single H100, and improves VQA performance on LongVideoBench (+4.30) and OVOBench Realtime (+5.96) without VQA-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM effectively addresses the challenge of real-time infinite video understanding through a streaming-aligned framework that enables stable performance while enhancing general VQA capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based approaches for radio map generation suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, hindering practical deployment in next-generation wireless systems.

Method: Proposed RadioFlow framework uses flow-matching to learn continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling single-step efficient sampling instead of iterative denoising.

Result: RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 8√ó fewer parameters and over 4√ó faster inference compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff) while preserving reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: RadioFlow provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-depth is a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework that integrates CLIP and DINO foundation models to extract multi-grained features (global semantics and local spatial details) through contrastive language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods suffer from insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge extraction, limiting their performance. The authors aim to address this by leveraging foundation models to provide richer contextual information.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Aggregates multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance with a proxy task for depth-aware feature alignment; 2) Integrates camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions. The method works as a plug-and-play encoder for existing MDE pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI benchmark show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception.

Conclusion: By systematically integrating foundation models (CLIP and DINO) with language guidance, Hybrid-depth effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches and achieves superior performance in self-supervised monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: IRCR-Net is a semi-supervised method for nuclei instance segmentation that uses instance-aware consistency regularization and morphological priors to reduce pseudo-label noise and improve segmentation accuracy, especially for dense and overlapping nuclei.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised methods are limited by expensive annotation costs, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to properly regularize instance-level consistency, lack pathological structure priors, and introduce noisy pseudo-labels during training.

Method: Proposes Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) with Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms, incorporating morphological prior knowledge to assess and filter pseudo-label quality.

Result: Significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IRCR-Net effectively addresses limitations of existing semi-supervised methods by leveraging instance-aware consistency regularization and morphological priors, achieving superior performance in nuclei instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

*Jinyuan Liu,Zihang Chen,Zhu Liu,Zhiying Jiang,Long Ma,Xin Fan,Risheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN) for thermal infrared image enhancement that handles coupled degradations through prompt-based feature modulation and selective progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared enhancement methods only handle individual degradations and struggle with coupled degradations, while all-in-one RGB methods are ineffective due to different imaging models.

Method: PPFN establishes prompt pairs based on thermal imaging process, fuses them to modulate features for specific degradations, and uses Selective Progressive Training to gradually refine handling of composite cases.

Result: Achieves 8.76% improvement on complex degradation scenes, removes camera noise while retaining structural details, and enhances overall contrast of thermal images.

Conclusion: The proposed PPFN with prompt fusion and progressive training effectively handles coupled degradations in thermal infrared images and significantly outperforms existing methods on complex scenes.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes using vision-language models (VLMs) for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, addressing limitations of traditional methods and benchmark issues. They introduce Fine-tune-CoT and dynamic CoT strategies to improve reasoning capabilities and overcome "overthinking" problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-modal approaches have limitations in handling absence and unseen scenarios, and existing benchmarks overestimate model capability due to training-test overlap. The authors aim to leverage VLMs to advance beyond text-only methods for multi-modal keyphrase prediction.

Method: 1) Use zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning to assess VLM baseline performance; 2) Implement Fine-tune-CoT using high-quality reasoning data from teacher models to fine-tune smaller models; 3) Propose dynamic CoT strategy that adaptively injects CoT data during training to address "overthinking" and enable flexible reasoning during inference.

Result: Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, showing improved performance in multi-modal keyphrase prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed VLM-based approaches with Fine-tune-CoT and dynamic CoT strategies effectively address limitations in multi-modal keyphrase prediction, providing enhanced reasoning capabilities and overcoming benchmark evaluation issues.

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice is a vision-centric reasoning benchmark that challenges MLLMs to perform fine-grained visual observation and analytical reasoning, moving beyond shallow perception to require image-grounded reasoning without external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks primarily assess language-based reasoning and treat visual input as replaceable context, creating a gap for evaluating true vision-centric reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Method: The benchmark integrates three components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process.

Result: Evaluation of 20 leading MLLMs shows BLINK-Twice poses significant challenges. While language-based reasoning strategies can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. Repeated image observation improves performance, and active visual interaction models highlight the need for new vision reasoning paradigms.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with true vision-centric reasoning, and there is a need for new paradigms that move beyond language-based reasoning strategies to effectively handle fine-grained visual observation and analytical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

*Yikang Zhang,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD-GS is a 3D Gaussian splatting framework that addresses geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes by identifying unreliable structures, selecting diverse supporting views, and recovering missing geometry through patch matching-based multi-view stereo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS performance depends heavily on initialized point cloud quality, which often fails in unbounded dynamic urban environments due to incomplete coverage and overlapping frustum requirements. Partial initialization leads to distortions and artifacts from incorrect gradient propagation.

Method: Uses voxel-based visibility reasoning to identify unreliable geometry, diversity-aware view selection for informative supporting views, and patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction to recover missing structures by generating new Gaussian primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo and nuScenes datasets show VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves reconstructed geometry quality for both static and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: VAD-GS effectively addresses the limitations of 3DGS in urban environments by enabling geometry recovery in regions lacking initial points through reliable geometric priors and multi-view stereo reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

*Jinxiang Tu,Dayong Ren,Fei Shi,Zhenhong Jia,Yahong Ren,Jiwei Qin,Fang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Minkowski-MambaNet is a deep learning framework that directly estimates forest volume and biomass from raw LiDAR data by integrating Mamba's Selective State Space Model with Minkowski networks to capture global context and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest biomass quantification is crucial for carbon cycle monitoring, but existing methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies needed to distinguish individual trees in LiDAR point clouds.

Method: The framework integrates Mamba's Selective State Space Model into a Minkowski network to encode global context and long-range dependencies, with skip connections to enhance features and accelerate convergence. It works directly on raw LiDAR without requiring Digital Terrain Models.

Result: Evaluated on Danish National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust biomass estimates while being robust to boundary artifacts.

Conclusion: This work provides a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis that advances LiDAR-based forest inventories by eliminating the need for DTM preprocessing and improving accuracy through better tree differentiation.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

### [82] [Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09380)
*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods to exploit sparsity in DETR's MLP layers for efficient inference without retraining: SIBS (heuristic static sparsification) and MGS (dynamic gating mechanism that achieves 85-95% activation sparsity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models face efficiency challenges in vision tasks like object detection, and there's inherent sparsity in DETR's MLP layers that can be exploited to reduce computation without retraining.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS) - heuristic method using fixed activation patterns; 2) Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS) - lightweight gating mechanism with small linear layer trained on pretrained DETR to predict dynamic sparsity.

Result: MGS achieves 85-95% activation sparsity while maintaining or improving performance on COCO dataset, significantly reducing computation compared to baseline DETR.

Conclusion: MGS provides a practical, input-adaptive sparsification approach that enables efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without requiring full model retraining.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

*Jin-Chuan Shi,Chengye Su,Jiajun Wang,Ariel Shamir,Miao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mono4DEditor is a framework for text-driven editing of 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos, enabling precise semantic edits in localized regions while preserving unedited content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing 4D scenes from monocular videos is challenging but valuable for content creation and virtual environments, with the main difficulty being achieving semantically precise edits in localized regions of complex dynamic scenes while preserving unedited content.

Method: Augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features for language-embedded dynamic representation, uses two-stage point-level localization (CLIP similarity selection + spatial refinement), and performs targeted edits with diffusion-based video editing using flow and scribble guidance.

Result: Enables high-quality text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types while preserving appearance and geometry of unedited areas, surpassing prior approaches in flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor provides an effective solution for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing, addressing key challenges in semantic precision and content preservation.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

*Ruirui Lin,Guoxi Huang,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWTA-Net is a two-stage framework for low-light video enhancement that uses Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment and recurrent refinement with dynamic temporal aggregation to suppress noise and improve visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based approaches for low-light video enhancement struggle with heavy noise in real scenes due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I uses Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment to recover brightness, color, and structure. Stage II employs recurrent refinement with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, plus a texture-adaptive loss for detail preservation.

Result: DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts in real-world low-light videos, delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DWTA-Net framework successfully addresses noise and temporal information challenges in low-light video enhancement through its two-stage approach combining short- and long-term temporal cues.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

*Jisu Han,Wonjun Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes dimensional entropy maximization to improve calibration in test-time prompt tuning for Vision-Language Models by regularizing textual feature distributions to mitigate dominant dimension dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from modality gaps caused by single dominant feature dimensions across modalities, which degrades calibration performance during test-time adaptation.

Method: Dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to reduce dependency on dominant dimensions.

Result: The method alleviates calibration degradation in test-time prompt tuning and improves the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a simple yet effective solution to enhance VLM reliability by addressing dominant dimension issues through entropy-based regularization.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

*Ruben Pascual,Mikel Sesma-Sara,Aranzazu Jurio,Daniel Paternain,Mikel Galar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for generating unlimited novel characters that preserve the artistic style of a small set of reference characters, using DreamBooth fine-tuning with multi-token strategy and LoRA-based parameter-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The audiovisual industry needs automated tools to create novel characters while preserving specific artistic styles from limited reference examples, expanding creative possibilities in animation and gaming.

Method: Adapts DreamBooth fine-tuning with multi-token strategy using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Removes class-specific regularization and introduces random tokens/embeddings during generation.

Result: Evaluated on five specialized datasets, the method produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving distinctive aesthetic features of reference characters, with human evaluation confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables unlimited character creation while maintaining learned artistic style, demonstrating potential for creative applications in animation and gaming industries.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

*David V√°zquez-Pad√≠n,Fernando P√©rez-Gonz√°lez,Alejandro Mart√≠n-Del-R√≠o*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Samsung Galaxy S and A series smartphones exhibit diagonal artifacts that cause PRNU fingerprint collisions, but raw images from PRO mode bypass this issue. The artifacts can be used forensically to reduce HDR misdetections and localize synthetic bokeh regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphone images and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification, particularly addressing fingerprint collisions and forensic limitations.

Method: Analyzed images from multiple Samsung Galaxy S and A series models, compared PRNU verification with and without raw images from PRO mode, and explored forensic applications of the artifacts.

Result: Found common diagonal pattern causing fingerprint collisions across Galaxy S models and some A models. Raw images bypass artifact introduction, enabling reliable PRNU verification. Artifacts can help reduce HDR misdetections and localize synthetic bokeh regions.

Conclusion: Diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphones pose challenges for PRNU verification but raw images provide a solution. The artifacts have forensic utility for improving HDR analysis and identifying synthetic bokeh effects, though mid-range models and forensic cases without raw access remain problematic.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

### [88] [PRNet: Original Information Is All You Have](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09531)
*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet is a real-time detection framework that preserves primitive shallow spatial features to improve small object detection in aerial images, addressing information degradation issues through progressive refinement and optimized downsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction, where shallow spatial details fail to align with semantic information, causing frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based methods have limitations in reconstructing accurate details that align with original image information.

Method: PRNet uses two key modules: Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets show that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: PRNet effectively addresses the information degradation problem in small object detection by prioritizing preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features, demonstrating superior performance in real-time aerial image detection.

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLOWING is a novel morphing framework that models warping as differential vector flows, ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence without costly regularizations, achieving state-of-the-art morphing quality for 2D images and 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLP-based implicit neural representations for morphing require expensive regularizations that lead to unstable training and poor feature alignment. There's a need for more principled approaches that naturally ensure structural properties of morphing transformations.

Method: FLOWING recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, encoding structural flow properties directly into network architectures to ensure continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence.

Result: FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality across various applications including face and image morphing, and Gaussian Splatting morphing, with faster convergence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The flow-centric approach provides principled and stable transformations for accurate, structure-preserving morphing, overcoming limitations of standard MLP-based methods while eliminating the need for costly regularizations.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA introduces dynamic, context-aware control for diffusion models by conditioning model weights directly through time-dependent LoRA adapters, outperforming static activation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use static conditioning strategies that don't adapt to the dynamic, multi-stage denoising process, limiting their ability to respond appropriately as generation evolves from coarse to fine detail.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and user conditions, enabling adaptive conditioning strategies.

Result: Significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions across various data domains compared to static, activation-based methods.

Conclusion: TC-LoRA establishes a paradigm where conditioning strategy is modified through deeper functional adaptation of weights, allowing control to align with dynamic task demands and generative stages.

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR is a unified detection framework for biomedical settings that enables few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen tasks within a single model, outperforming prior methods especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection in biomedical settings faces challenges due to scarce labeled data and frequent emergence of novel or rare categories, requiring robust methods that can handle few-shot learning and open-set recognition.

Method: Built on a class-agnostic DETR backbone, FSP-DETR constructs class prototypes from support images and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes prototype matching loss, alignment-based separation loss, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks show FSP-DETR significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, particularly in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: FSP-DETR provides a unified framework that enables inference-time flexibility for unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining, addressing key challenges in biomedical object detection.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of research trends in computer vision and machine learning conferences (CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS) from 2023-2025, identifying major shifts toward multimodal vision-language models, generative methods, and 3D/video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent, reproducible measurement of evolving research trends across major AI conferences, enabling better understanding of the field's direction and facilitating auditing and extension of the analysis.

Method: Analyzed 26,104 accepted papers by normalizing titles/abstracts, using phrase-protection, and matching against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels across tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and modalities.

Result: Identified three major shifts: (1) rapid rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work reframing perception as instruction following, (2) steady expansion of generative methods focusing on diffusion controllability/distillation/speed, and (3) resilient 3D/video activity with composition moving to Gaussian splatting and human-centric understanding.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals consistent longitudinal trends across venues, with parameter-efficient adaptation dominating VLM research and training practices shifting from scratch-built encoders to instruction tuning. The lexicon and methodology are released to enable community auditing and extension.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpaceVista-1M, a large-scale spatial reasoning dataset with 1M QA pairs across 5 spatial scales and 19 task types, and SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that uses scale-aware experts and progressive training to achieve strong generalization across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial reasoning approaches struggle with diverse applications like robotics and autonomous driving due to reliance on indoor 3D scans, labor-intensive annotations, and lack of effective all-scale scene modeling that causes overfitting to individual scenes.

Method: The authors developed a holistic solution including: 1) a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, 2) scale-aware modeling, 3) progressive training paradigm, 4) automated pipeline to curate SpaceVista-1M dataset (38K video scenes, 1M QA pairs), and 5) SpaceVista-7B model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards.

Result: Extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with strong generalization across all scales and scenarios. The model shows robust spatial reasoning capabilities in diverse applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully advances all-scale spatial reasoning by addressing dataset curation challenges and developing effective scale-aware modeling, providing a comprehensive solution for spatial intelligence in MLLMs across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

*Shaoqi Dong,Chaoyou Fu,Haihan Gao,Yi-Fan Zhang,Chi Yan,Chu Wu,Xiaoyu Liu,Yunhang Shen,Jing Huo,Deqiang Jiang,Haoyu Cao,Yang Gao,Xing Sun,Ran He,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A distillation-based framework that equips pretrained vision-language models with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from small action models, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language Action (VLA) models from scratch is costly, and existing methods need to leverage pretrained models more efficiently for robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) lightweight alignment mapping VLM hidden states to action space of small action model, 2) selective fine-tuning of language model, state encoder, and action modules. Architecture adds only action token and state encoder to original VLM structure.

Result: Achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). Real-world experiments show 82.0% success rate (17% improvement over teacher model) across five manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility issues with Google's Titans model due to lack of public code and ambiguous descriptions, and to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.

Method: Lightweight reimplementation of Titans followed by comprehensive evaluation on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.

### [96] [ConPoSe: LLM-Guided Contact Point Selection for Scalable Cooperative Object Pushing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08705)
*Noah Steinkr√ºger,Nisarga Nilavadi,Wolfram Burgard,Tanja Katharina Kaiser*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ConPoSe combines LLM reasoning with local search to select contact points for multi-robot object pushing, outperforming analytical and pure LLM approaches in scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative object transport in cluttered environments requires multiple robots to push large objects, but analytical contact point selection becomes combinatorially complex with more robots and larger objects.

Method: LLM-guided local search (ConPoSe) that leverages large language models' common-sense reasoning capabilities combined with local optimization to select robot-object contact points.

Result: ConPoSe successfully selects contact points for various shapes (cuboids, cylinders, T-shapes) and scales better than analytical approaches with robot count and object size, while outperforming pure LLM-based selection.

Conclusion: Combining LLM reasoning with local search provides an effective solution for scalable contact point selection in cooperative multi-robot object transport.

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

### [97] [Point and Go: Intuitive Reference Frame Reallocation in Mode Switching for Assistive Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08753)
*A. Wang,C. Jiang,M. Przystupa,J. Valentine,M. Jagersand*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Point and Go mode switching improves wheelchair-mounted robotic manipulator control by replacing unintuitive Cartesian mode switching with intuitive translation and rotation modes, reducing completion times by 31% and mode switches by 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Cartesian mode switching for wheelchair-mounted robotic manipulators has drawbacks including unintuitive control reference frames, separate translation/orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that hinder user performance.

Method: Proposes Point and Go mode switching with two key components: (1) a novel sweeping motion to point the gripper, defining translation axis along robot base frame's horizontal plane, and (2) rotation mode combining position control with refined end-effector oriented frame for precise actions.

Result: User study showed Point and Go reduced completion times by 31%, pauses by 41%, and mode switches by 33% compared to Cartesian mode switching and state-of-the-art learning methods, with significantly favorable user survey responses.

Conclusion: Point and Go mode switching provides more intuitive control for wheelchair-mounted robotic manipulators, enabling complex human-like movements without frequent mode switching and significantly improving user performance and experience.

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing table tennis robots that match human speed, accuracy, and ability to handle ball spins remains challenging for legged robots.

Method: Uses external cameras for ball localization, physical models with learned residuals for spin inference and trajectory prediction, and novel model predictive control (MPC) for agile full-body control.

Result: Demonstrated on Spot quadruped with accurate system components, ability to aim and return balls with varying spin types, and successful rallying with human players.

Conclusion: The system successfully integrates perception, prediction, and control to enable quadrupedal robots to play dynamic table tennis at human-comparable levels.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GPI treats demonstrations as geometric curves to create distance fields for imitation learning, achieving higher success rates and 20x faster execution than diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink imitation learning by moving beyond treating demonstrations as state-action samples and instead leveraging their geometric properties for more efficient and robust policy learning.

Method: Derives distance fields from demonstration curves to create progression and attraction flows, forming a controllable vector field that directly guides robot behavior without parametric models.

Result: Achieves higher success rates than diffusion-based policies, runs 20 times faster, requires less memory, and remains robust to perturbations in both simulation and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: GPI establishes an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to generative approaches for robotic imitation learning, supporting multimodality and easy composition of new demonstrations.

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot learning datasets mainly focus on stationary robot arms, with limited humanoid datasets that lack task diversity, human-humanoid interaction, and standardized evaluation platforms for humanoid manipulation.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset using a human-supervised teleoperation pipeline that collects high-quality multimodal sensory data (RGB, depth, LiDAR, tactile) with natural language annotations across 260 tasks in 7 categories.

Result: Collected 10.3k trajectories and over 3 million frames of data, and conducted analysis of representative policy learning methods to understand their strengths and limitations across different task categories.

Conclusion: Humanoid Everyday dataset, policy learning analysis, and cloud-based evaluation platform aim to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and enable more capable robotic agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

*Jiurun Song,Xiao Liang,Minghui Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A contact-informed adaptive motion-planning framework that infers human intent from physical contact for real-time motion correction in human-robot collaboration, using optimization-based force estimation and torque-based contact detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration by allowing robots to adapt motions to human intent without relying on continuous kinesthetic guidance or complex sensor installations.

Method: Proposes optimization-based force estimation from joint torque measurements, torque-based contact detection with link-level localization, and a contact-informed adaptive motion planner for online motion replanning.

Result: Experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator demonstrate accurate force estimation and effective motion planning under perception uncertainty in HRC scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables robots to infer human intent directly from physical contact and adapt motions in real-time, addressing challenges in reliable motion planning for human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations, requiring autonomous science operations in communication-constrained environments.

Method: Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework integrated with Bayesian network in the observation space to manage high-dimensional uncertain measurements, with instrument operation policies computed offline for resource-aware planning.

Result: The approach reduces sample identification errors by nearly 40% compared to the mission's baseline Concept of Operations, with improved performance in off-nominal sample accumulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The POMDP framework with Bayesian networks provides an effective solution for autonomous science operations in deep space missions, offering better interpretability, computational tractability, and reduced misclassification rates.

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CDE uses vision-language models to generate object concepts from task descriptions, then trains policies to reconstruct these concepts as intrinsic rewards for efficient visual RL exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL struggles with inefficient exploration due to the need to extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels, unlike low-dimensional state-based RL.

Method: Leverages pre-trained VLMs to generate object-centric concepts from text descriptions, trains policies to reconstruct concepts via auxiliary objective, uses reconstruction accuracy as intrinsic reward.

Result: Achieves efficient targeted exploration across 5 simulated visual manipulation tasks, robust to noisy VLM predictions, and attains 80% success rate in real-world Franka arm deployment.

Conclusion: CDE enables efficient visual RL exploration by internalizing object concepts, reducing dependence on external models during deployment while maintaining robustness to noisy supervision.

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

TL;DR: Proposes a tightly coupled online calibration method for IMU-odometer systems using raw GNSS measurements with factor graph optimization, achieving significant improvements in localization accuracy over loosely coupled methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNSS-aided calibration methods rely on positioning results without ambiguity resolution and have underexplored observability properties, limiting their accuracy and reliability for autonomous ground vehicle localization.

Method: Tightly coupled fusion of IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, Doppler) within extendable factor graph optimization framework with outlier mitigation and ambiguity resolution.

Result: Observability analysis shows two horizontal translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion. Real-world experiments demonstrate up to 71.14% improvement in positioning accuracy (17.75m vs 61.51m maximum error) compared to loosely coupled methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides superior calibration and localization performance, and the authors release the first open-source dataset combining IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from rover and base stations to foster further research.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework combining Model-Free and Model-Based RL improves in-hand manipulation performance for robotic hands, though with increased computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-Hand Manipulation is challenging due to complex dynamics and the need to control various objects. The work aims to verify if a hybrid RL framework can improve task performance.

Method: Combines Model-Free and Model-Based RL by guiding a trained policy using a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory evaluation (similar to Model Predictive Control). Tests performed with fully-actuated and under-actuated robotic hands manipulating different objects.

Result: The hybrid framework improves in-hand manipulation performance for most test cases, even when object properties (density, size) are changed, but increases computational cost due to trajectory evaluation complexity.

Conclusion: Given a high-reward policy and accurate dynamic model, the hybrid RL framework effectively enhances in-hand manipulation tasks, though computational efficiency is sacrificed for performance gains.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the
complexity of trajectory evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have safety and adaptability advantages but face control challenges due to complex nonlinear dynamics. DeePC offers a model-free approach that bypasses explicit system identification, but its application to 3D soft robots remains underexplored.

Method: Developed a DeePC framework with SVD-based dimension reduction for a 3D cable-driven soft arm. The soft arm features a thick tubing backbone for stability, dense silicone body with cavities for strength/flexibility, and rigid endcaps. Tested on fixed-point regulation and 3D trajectory tracking tasks.

Result: Comparative experiments showed DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability compared to baseline model-based controllers for both control tasks in 3D space.

Conclusion: DeePC presents a practical solution for dynamic control of soft robots, effectively addressing the challenges of their complex nonlinear dynamics without requiring explicit system modeling.

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for solving point proximity problems to axisymmetric quadrics that can be implemented in common programming languages and outperforms existing commercial solutions.

Method: Reduces 3D proximity problems to 2D, uses geometric properties of conics (sub-normal, semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope, radius), and categorizes 2D problems into sub-cases based on point location for parabolas and ellipses/hyperbolas.

Result: The proposed method proved to be faster than the commercial Bullet library and is suitable for implementation in programming languages like C.

Conclusion: The novel approach of reducing 3D problems to 2D and using geometric properties provides an efficient solution for point proximity to axisymmetric quadrics that outperforms existing commercial libraries.

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial

*Daniel A. Williams,Airlie Chapman,Daniel R. Little,Chris Manzie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a trust dynamics model for human supervisors of autonomous systems using a switched linear system with event-triggered sampling to address asymmetric responses to performance and intermittent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack the ability to handle asymmetric trust responses to autonomous system performance and the intermittent nature of supervisor-system communication, which are crucial for successful human-autonomous system interactions.

Method: Employed a switched linear system structure with event-triggered sampling of model input and output, and used trust response data from 51 participants to identify parameters for a switched linear model-based observer.

Result: Developed an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates asymmetric responses to performance and intermittent communication patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully addresses key limitations in existing trust dynamics models and provides a framework for better understanding and predicting supervisor trust in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: iMoWM is an interactive world model that generates color images, depth maps, and robot arm masks autoregressively using MMTokenizer to unify multi-modal inputs into compact tokens, enabling efficient 3D-aware world modeling for robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D video-based world models lack geometric and spatial reasoning essential for capturing the physical structure of the 3D world in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposes iMoWM with MMTokenizer that unifies multi-modal inputs (color images, depth maps, robot arm masks) into compact token representations, enabling autoregressive generation while leveraging pretrained VideoGPT models efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments show iMoWM improves visual quality of future predictions and serves as an effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning and real-world imitation learning.

Conclusion: Multi-modal world modeling with 3D information provides significant advantages for robotic manipulation tasks compared to traditional 2D approaches.

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

### [110] [Training Models to Detect Successive Robot Errors from Human Reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09080)
*Shannon Liu,Maria Teresa Parreira,Wendy Ju*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Machine learning models trained on human behavioral reactions can detect robot errors with 93.5% accuracy and classify successive failures with 84.1% accuracy, showing that evolving human responses reveal repeated robot failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is essential for effective human-robot interaction. When robots fail repeatedly, they need to know when to change behavior, and human reactions provide natural cues that intensify over successive failures.

Method: Used machine learning to recognize stages of robot failure from human reactions. Conducted a study with 26 participants interacting with a robot making repeated conversational errors, extracted behavioral features from video data, and trained individual user models.

Result: The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% accuracy for classifying successive failures. Behavioral features from human reactions proved effective for error detection.

Conclusion: Modeling the progression of human reactions enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns in human-robot interaction, providing robots with better awareness of when to change behavior.

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

*Jikai Wang,Yunqi Cheng,Kezhi Wang,Zonghai Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation system with flexible map representation, robust map matching, and map-less local navigation that improves robustness against environmental changes and dynamic objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust trajectory repeat navigation remains challenging due to environmental changes and dynamic objects in unknown environments.

Method: Uses topo-metric graph for map representation, keyframe clustering for place recognition via frame-to-local-map matching, long-term goal management, and local trajectory-control optimization without maps.

Result: Extensive experiments show the system is superior to baselines in robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a robust solution for visual teach-and-repeat navigation in changing environments.

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

*Xinhu Li,Ayush Jain,Zhaojing Yang,Yigit Korkmaz,Erdem Bƒ±yƒ±k*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method that enables robots to learn better policies than constrained experts by using demonstrations to infer state-only rewards and exploring more efficient trajectories, achieving 10x faster task completion than behavioral cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current demonstration interfaces (kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, sim-to-real) constrain experts from showing optimal behavior due to indirect control and hardware limitations, leading to suboptimal learned policies.

Method: Use demonstrations to infer state-only reward signals measuring task progress, self-label rewards for unknown states via temporal interpolation, and allow exploration of shorter, more efficient trajectories beyond direct imitation.

Result: Outperforms common imitation learning in sample efficiency and task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, completes tasks in 12 seconds - 10x faster than behavioral cloning.

Conclusion: Robots can learn superior policies compared to constrained expert demonstrations by going beyond direct imitation and leveraging inferred reward signals to explore more optimal trajectories.

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on

*Zihao Mao,Yunheng Wang,Yunting Ji,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized hierarchical navigation framework for multi-robot systems in GPS-denied environments that combines strategic topological planning with tactical metric execution to achieve both global awareness and local agility without centralized coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental trade-off between global strategic foresight and local tactical agility in multi-robot navigation under limited communication, where centralized methods have high overhead and distributed methods lack awareness to avoid deadlocks.

Method: A fully decentralized hierarchical framework with two layers: strategic layer builds and exchanges lightweight topological maps during encounters for emergent global awareness and trap-avoiding route planning; tactical layer uses sampling-based escape point strategy with local metric information to resolve conflicts and generate feasible trajectories.

Result: The system significantly outperforms existing methods in success rate and efficiency, particularly in communication-limited environments with complex topological structures, as demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized hierarchical framework successfully achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without unified coordinate systems, effectively solving the navigation trade-off in GPS-denied, communication-limited multi-robot scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flow-Opt is a learning-based approach for centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization that uses flow-matching with diffusion transformers and a learned safety filter to generate smooth trajectories for tens of robots in milliseconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized trajectory optimization for multiple robots can produce smoother trajectories in tight spaces but becomes computationally intractable beyond small swarm sizes.

Method: Proposes Flow-Opt with two components: 1) a flow-matching generative model using diffusion transformers with permutation invariant encoders to sample candidate trajectories, and 2) a learned Safety-Filter with custom solver and neural network for context-specific initialization trained via self-supervision.

Result: Generates trajectories for tens of robots in cluttered environments in tens of milliseconds - several times faster than existing centralized approaches and orders of magnitude faster than diffusion-based baselines. Can batch solve multiple problem instances in fractions of a second and produce diverse collision-avoidance behaviors.

Conclusion: Flow-Opt significantly advances computational tractability for centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization, enabling real-time planning for larger robot swarms while maintaining trajectory quality and diversity.

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight (311g) prosthetic hand with only four motors achieves in-hand manipulation for daily activities through optimized thumb positioning and single-axis thumb design, enabling reorientation between precision and lateral grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current electric prosthetic hands are either too heavy for daily use or require complex mechanisms that expose components to damage. There's a need for lightweight, cosmetically human-like hands with internal motors that can perform in-hand manipulation for daily activities.

Method: Combines a single-axis thumb with optimized thumb positioning to achieve basic postures and in-hand manipulation (reorientation between precision and lateral grasps) using only four motors in a lightweight design.

Result: Experimental validation showed 90-100% success rates for reorientation tasks with various object widths (5-30mm) and shapes. Successfully performed seal stamping, USB device insertion, and screwdriver operation.

Conclusion: The proposed four-motor prosthetic hand design successfully achieves lightweight in-hand manipulation capabilities suitable for daily use, overcoming limitations of existing heavy or complex prosthetic hands.

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

Result: Initial deployment of navigation module completed, with ongoing work on finer-grained whole-body loco-manipulation deployment.

Conclusion: HANDO provides a hierarchical approach for legged robots to perform complex human-centered mobile manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

Method: Encodes a single artificial demonstration as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively reshapes it using policy-based reinforcement learning. The reshaped trajectories create a dataset used to train a neural network that maps task parameters (obstacle dimensions and locations from point clouds) to DMP parameters for trajectory generation.

Conclusion: The method efficiently generates smooth, near-optimal, collision-free 3D Cartesian trajectories from a single demonstration, reducing the need for large datasets or costly human demonstrations while maintaining performance advantages over traditional planning methods.

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key

TL;DR: FIPER is a framework for predicting failures in generative imitation learning policies at runtime without needing failure data, using OOD detection and action uncertainty measures calibrated via conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts and compounding errors in generative imitation learning can cause unsafe robot behavior, making early failure prediction essential for safety-critical applications.

Method: Uses random network distillation for OOD detection and a novel action-chunk entropy score for uncertainty measurement, both calibrated via conformal prediction using successful rollouts.

Result: FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods across five simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: This work represents an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies for deployment in human-centered environments.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under
uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source
framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object
dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the
study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and
emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate
realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of
belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured
representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective
tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex,
uncertain environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Transformer-based imitation learning framework for soft robotic guidewire navigation in endovascular surgery, achieving 83% success rate on unseen vascular geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate soft robotic guidewire navigation to overcome challenges in modeling and control, increasing precision and safety of endovascular procedures like aneurysm treatment.

Method: Transformer-based imitation learning with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections, trained on 647 demonstrations across 36 modular bifurcated geometries under simulated fluoroscopy.

Result: Achieved 83% success rate on three previously unseen vascular geometries, outperforming several baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation and shows promising results for autonomous endovascular surgery.

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

### [125] [Guiding Energy-Efficient Locomotion through Impact Mitigation Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09543)
*Chenghao Wang,Arjun Viswanathan,Eric Sihite,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method that combines Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF) with Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) to enable reinforcement learning policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories and implicit passive dynamics from animal reference motion, achieving up to 32% energy efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning approaches in robotics capture explicit kinematic patterns (gaits) but overlook the implicit passive dynamics that make animal locomotion energy-efficient. This gap limits the energy efficiency of learned robotic motions.

Method: The approach integrates a physics-informed reward term based on Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF) with Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). IMF quantifies a robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts, allowing RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories and implicit passive dynamics.

Result: The method demonstrates energy efficiency improvements of up to 32% as measured by Cost of Transport (CoT), working effectively with both AMP and handcrafted reward structures.

Conclusion: By incorporating IMF with AMP, the approach successfully bridges the gap between explicit kinematic imitation and implicit passive dynamics learning, enabling more energy-efficient robotic locomotion that better replicates animals' natural motion efficiency.

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

Motivation: Enable autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments without relying on predefined maps or extensive training, addressing the challenge of simultaneous exploration, localization, and planning under uncertainty.

Method: Uses Active Inference-based framework with topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory inspired by hippocampal navigation. Builds sparse topological maps online, learns state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimizing Expected Free Energy.

Result: Demonstrated robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments against state-of-the-art planning models. The system is resilient to drift, adaptable to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise, and supports both exploration and goal-directed navigation without pre-training.

Conclusion: AIMAPP provides a biologically inspired, modular solution for scalable, self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings, offering a unified approach to mapping, localization, and decision-making that works with diverse hardware configurations.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at

*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Est√©vez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AScience framework enables large-scale exploratory discovery through LLM-based research agents that self-organize into networks to produce and peer-review findings, demonstrating effective hypothesis hunting across scientific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale scientific datasets create opportunities for exploratory discovery unconstrained by specific research questions, but traditional methods struggle with vast hypothesis spaces - this gap motivates the need for automated hypothesis hunting systems.

Method: AScience framework models discovery as interaction of agents, networks, and evaluation norms, implemented as ASCollab - a distributed system of LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors that self-organize into evolving networks and continually produce/peer-review findings under shared evaluation standards.

Result: Experiments show social dynamics enable accumulation of expert-rated results along diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic targets in cancer cohorts.

Conclusion: Socially structured, agentic networks can sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale, though wet-lab validation remains indispensable for final confirmation of findings.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

TL;DR: LLM-based framework critiques VRP-generated delivery routes using policy criteria, achieving 79-86% accuracy in identifying routing issues, offering scalable evaluation beyond conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Last-mile delivery accounts for nearly half of operational expenses in India's growing e-commerce market, but traditional VRP solvers are limited by unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes a framework using large language models to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, generating and evaluating 400 cases with both open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Result: Open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved up to 86% accuracy in evaluating delivery plans.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes provides an effective and scalable layer of assessment beyond conventional distance/time metrics, with potential to improve cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM is a unified world model that integrates visual foresight and planning in a single multimodal autoregressive backbone, improving navigation success by up to 30% through imagination-driven reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modular architectures separate navigation planning from visual world modeling, causing state-action misalignment and limited adaptability in novel scenarios.

Method: UniWM uses a unified, memory-augmented world model with hierarchical memory that integrates short-term perceptual cues with long-term trajectory context for coherent reasoning.

Result: Improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, reduces trajectory errors significantly across four benchmarks, and shows strong zero-shot generalization on unseen data.

Conclusion: UniWM represents a principled step toward unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation that ensures tight alignment between prediction and control.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLMs for heuristic design with explanations of underperformance and specialized fixes produces more robust algorithms with 28x better worst-case performance than FunSearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based heuristic design approaches lack tools to explain why heuristics underperform and provide suggestions for improvement, limiting their robustness and performance.

Method: Augment LLM-based heuristic design with three simple ideas: (1) expose LLM to underperforming instances, (2) explain why underperformance occurs, and (3) specialize design to regions in the input space.

Result: Generated heuristics achieve ~28x better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improved average performance, while maintaining runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: Simple augmentation techniques that provide explanations of underperformance and specialized fixes can significantly enhance the robustness and performance of LLM-generated heuristics.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [131] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses context management issues in long-horizon tasks by separating tactical execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into specialized components, achieving up to 20% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon tasks requiring sustained reasoning and multiple tool interactions are challenging for LLM agents due to small errors compounding across steps, hallucinations, and loss of coherence. Extended histories cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant information.

Method: COMPASS uses three specialized components: (1) Main Agent for reasoning and tool use, (2) Meta-Thinker for monitoring progress and strategic interventions, and (3) Context Manager for maintaining concise, relevant progress briefs for different reasoning stages. Includes test-time scaling and post-training pipeline for efficiency.

Result: Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam), COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20% relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. Test-time scaling extension elevates performance to match established DeepResearch agents.

Conclusion: COMPASS effectively addresses context management as the central bottleneck in long-horizon reasoning tasks through specialized hierarchical organization, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency through delegation to smaller models.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates attribution bias in evaluating literary style, finding that both humans and AI systems show systematic bias against AI-generated content, with AI models showing 2.5x stronger bias than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI writing tools become widespread, there's a need to understand how both humans and machines evaluate literary style in a domain where objective standards are elusive and judgments are inherently subjective.

Method: Two controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style: Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages under blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled conditions; Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14√ó14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators.

Result: Both studies revealed systematic pro-human attribution bias: humans showed +13.7 percentage point bias while AI models showed +34.3 percentage point bias (2.5-fold stronger effect). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp). Attribution labels caused evaluators to invert assessment criteria.

Conclusion: AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training, and AI systems not only replicate but amplify this human tendency in aesthetic judgment.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Agent GPA framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation paradigm for AI agents based on Goal-Plan-Action operational loop with five metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic framework for evaluating AI agents that covers a broad range of agent failures and enables targeted performance improvements.

Method: The framework evaluates agents through five metrics applied to their operational loop: setting goals, devising plans, and executing actions. It uses LLM-judges and is tested on TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset and an internal production dataset.

Result: The framework covers all agent errors on TRAIL/GAIA benchmark, achieves 80-95% agreement with human annotation, and localizes errors with 86% agreement for targeted performance improvement.

Conclusion: The Agent GPA framework provides a systematic and comprehensive evaluation approach that effectively identifies agent failures, achieves high agreement with human judgment, and enables precise localization of errors for performance optimization.

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo is an AI-assisted peer review framework that achieves 81.8% accuracy in accept/reject decisions on ICLR 2025 papers, close to human reviewers (83.9%), with AI reviews rated higher quality than average human reviews but still below expert level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review suffers from inconsistencies, subjectivity, and scalability challenges in scientific publishing, creating a need for systematic AI assistance to complement human judgment.

Method: Developed ReviewerToo, a modular framework supporting experiments with specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria. Validated on 1,963 ICLR 2025 papers using gpt-oss-120b model, comparing AI performance against human reviewers.

Result: AI achieved 81.8% accuracy in accept/reject decisions vs 83.9% for average human reviewer. AI reviews were rated higher quality than human average by LLM judge, but trailed expert contributions. AI excels at fact-checking and literature coverage, but struggles with assessing novelty and theoretical contributions.

Conclusion: AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness in peer review while leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Provides foundation for hybrid peer-review systems that scale with scientific publishing growth.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [135] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTAlign is a game-theoretic alignment framework that treats LLM-user interaction as a strategic game, using payoff matrices to select mutually beneficial responses and training with mutual welfare rewards to improve reasoning efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional alignment assumes maximizing model reward maximizes user welfare, but this fails in practice - models often produce overly verbose or suboptimal responses when users prefer concise answers, creating a prisoner's dilemma situation.

Method: Integrates game-theoretic decision making into reasoning (constructing payoff matrices to estimate welfare for both LLM and user) and training (using mutual welfare reward to reinforce cooperative responses). Also includes inference technique that adapts responses to changing pricing policies.

Result: Extensive experiments show GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic alignment provides a principled mechanism for mutually beneficial LLM-user interactions, addressing the fundamental challenge of aligning individual rationality with social optimality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: LM Fight Arena is a novel framework that evaluates large multimodal models by having them compete against each other in Mortal Kombat II, testing real-time strategic reasoning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess LMM performance in real-time, adversarial environments, creating a gap between AI evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Method: Six leading open- and closed-source models compete in controlled Mortal Kombat II tournaments, interpreting game frames and state data to select actions, with all agents controlling the same character for fair comparison.

Result: The framework provides fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment of LMMs' strategic reasoning capabilities in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena introduces a challenging benchmark that bridges AI evaluation with interactive entertainment, offering a more realistic test of LMM capabilities.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential

closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character

and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Harshwardhan Fartale,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Ishita Prasad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a framework that uses mechanistic interpretability to detect data contamination in LLMs by distinguishing between recall-based and reasoning-based responses using 37 features from activation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination in LLMs leads to unreliable evaluation where models appear high-performing due to memorization rather than genuine reasoning, requiring better detection methods.

Method: Extracts 37 features including surface-level confidence trajectories, attention specialization, circuit dynamics, and activation flow patterns, then uses ensemble classifiers trained on these features.

Result: Achieves 93% accuracy overall, perfect performance on clear cases, and 76.7% accuracy on challenging ambiguous examples.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability shows strong potential for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics by reliably detecting data contamination.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

*Samuel Hildebrand,Curtis Taylor,Sean Oesch,James M Ghawaly Jr,Amir Sadovnik,Ryan Shivers,Brandon Schreiber,Kevin Kurian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating multimodal RAG pipelines with human-created questions across text, tables, and images, showing closed-source models outperform open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on specific aspects like retrieval, lacking comprehensive evaluation of RAG pipelines' ability to handle multimodal information ingestion and reasoning.

Method: Created 93 multimodal questions, developed phrase-level recall and hallucination detection metrics, compared 2 open-source and 4 closed-source pipelines with human evaluation.

Result: Closed-source pipelines significantly outperformed open-source ones, especially on multimodal and cross-document questions. Human evaluation showed strong agreement (4.62/5 for correctness, 4.53/5 for hallucination detection).

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark effectively evaluates multimodal RAG pipelines, revealing performance gaps between open-source and closed-source systems, with implications for future RAG development.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG is an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework that uses lightweight entity storage and multi-hop associative search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex QA benchmarks with 94% token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive neuroscience where cues activate entity-centered memory traces for multi-hop recollection, aiming to replicate this efficient retrieval mechanism in RAG systems.

Method: Extracts and stores only core entities with metadata during indexing, then performs multi-hop associative search using cue entities from queries, dynamically inferring implicit relations between entities to populate context.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving average Exact Match score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods on 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks, with 94% token reduction compared to other structured RAG systems.

Conclusion: The entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm is highly effective for complex question answering, validating the cognitive neuroscience-inspired approach to knowledge retrieval.

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch is a retrieval and fusion framework that improves deep-research systems by modeling two complementary graphs (breadth semantic and depth causal) to address context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths in scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-research frameworks suffer from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths despite orchestrating external tools for complex scientific reasoning.

Method: Proposes DualResearch with two complementary graphs: breadth semantic graph for stable background knowledge and depth causal graph for execution provenance. Uses semantic diffusion for breadth and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. Fuses evidence via entropy-gated rule with global calibration.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA. Using InternAgent log files, accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA. Compresses multi-tool execution logs into concise reasoning graphs.

Conclusion: DualResearch effectively addresses limitations of deep-research systems by modeling epistemic structure through complementary graphs and fusion mechanisms, enabling stable and effective answer reconstruction in scientific reasoning.

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCT is a new knowledge injection paradigm that fuses knowledge graphs with LLMs through semantic-condition tuning, outperforming traditional prefix-tuning by enabling deep feature-wise interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prefix-tuning methods simply concatenate knowledge embeddings with text inputs, overlooking rich relational semantics in knowledge graphs and imposing heavy implicit reasoning burden on LLMs.

Method: SCT uses a Semantic Graph Module with GNN to extract context-aware semantic conditions from local graph neighborhoods, and a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module that adaptively modulates textual embeddings via parameterized projectors for deep feature-wise interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other baselines on knowledge graph benchmarks, providing more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Conclusion: By modulating input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides more direct and potent signals for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V is a novel lightweight 3B multimodal model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy through two-stage optimization: LIPO for training reasoning models to generate concise responses, and AMM for merging specialist models into a unified architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models face challenges in reasoning efficiency including large model size, overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios, with limited research on lightweight MLLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage optimization: 1) LIPO (Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization) - RL method that dynamically adjusts response advantages to prioritize concise, high-quality responses; 2) AMM (Adaptive Model Merging) - training-free method that merges specialist models using adaptive weight adjustment and gradient projection regularization.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ten reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data, OCR, and general capabilities demonstrate superior performance, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V successfully addresses efficiency challenges in MLLMs through innovative two-stage optimization, achieving faster inference and higher accuracy while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks with fewer tokens.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Yincen Qu,Huan Xiao,Feng Li,Hui Zhou,Xiangying Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' travel planning capabilities, focusing on feasibility, reliability, and engagement with a unified reward system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' travel planning capabilities are insufficient in assessing feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark with fine-grained criteria unified into a single reward, created a dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world requests, and conducted experiments with diverse methods including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO.

Result: The evaluator achieved 60.75% agreement with travel-expert annotations and outperformed multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. RL generally improved itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark enables better evaluation of LLMs' travel planning capabilities, and RL methods show promise in improving plan feasibility and quality.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: LLMs can now detect errors in mathematical proofs but struggle with partial credit grading. The paper introduces agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and create problem-specific rubrics to improve grading consistency and human agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SOTA LLMs have progressed to solving most IMO problems, there's a need to assess their ability to grade proofs beyond binary correctness - detecting errors, judging severity, and assigning fair partial credit scores.

Method: Used a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on 1-4 scale with error annotations, plus MathArena IMO/USAMO 2025 solutions on 0-7 scale. Introduced agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading.

Result: Models reliably flag incorrect solutions but show calibration gaps in partial credit assignment. The proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows with problem-specific rubrics significantly improve LLM-based proof grading, addressing calibration gaps in partial credit assignment while maintaining reliable error detection capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

### [145] [Repairing Regex Vulnerabilities via Localization-Guided Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09037)
*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRR is a hybrid framework that combines symbolic analysis with LLMs to repair ReDoS vulnerabilities in regular expressions, achieving 15.4% higher repair rates than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ReDoS repair methods face a trade-off: symbolic approaches are precise but can't handle complex patterns, while LLMs are generalizable but unreliable for syntax/semantic correctness.

Method: LRR decouples problem identification from repair - first uses deterministic symbolic module to localize vulnerable subpatterns, then invokes LLM to generate semantically equivalent fixes for the isolated segments.

Result: The hybrid architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for rule-based repair while avoiding semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.

Conclusion: LRR provides a validated methodology for automated regex repair that harnesses LLM generalization while enforcing reliability through symbolic localization.

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes continuous memory for GUI agents using VLM embeddings to reduce context length while preserving visual details, with auto-scaling data collection and minimal fine-tuning achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of text-based memory in GUI agents that bloat context length and miss visual cues like widget size/position, preventing generalization across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks.

Method: Encodes GUI trajectories into fixed-length continuous embeddings using VLM as encoder, plugs into backbone input layer. Uses auto-scaling data flywheel: environment discovery, task synthesis with VLM, agent rollout, and VLM verification. Fine-tunes only memory encoder (LoRA on Q-Former, 1.2% parameters).

Result: Memory size and retrieval depth increase monotonically improve performance (unlike text memories). Achieves 100k+ trajectories for ~$4000. On real-world GUI benchmarks, consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory matches closed-source SOTA models like GPT-4o, Claude-4.

Conclusion: Continuous memory with VLM encoding effectively scales GUI agent memory, reducing context costs while preserving visual information, enabling generalization across interfaces and long tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

*Sang Hun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Dongkyu Park,So Young Lee,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes integrating psychoanalysis and MBTI personality types to create artificial consciousness modules, developing three consciousness types and 16 personality characters to simulate human-like cognition through various evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human consciousness is difficult to define scientifically, and current LLMs struggle with consciousness simulation due to hallucination issues. The research aims to address these limitations by incorporating psychological frameworks.

Method: Developed three artificial consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, preconsciousness) based on psychoanalysis principles, and 16 personality characters representing MBTI types with attributes like needs, status, and memories. Created ten situations with seven attributes for evaluation using survey evaluation, ChatGPT classification, and qualitative review.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses showed high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, though differences between characters and consciousness types were not very significant. The models demonstrated potential for humanoid consciousness simulation.

Conclusion: The integration of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to more intuitive and adaptable AI systems with humanoid consciousness, opening new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEC¬≥O is a multi-expert consensus system that assigns LLMs to specific code complexity classes, uses structured debates with class-specialized instructions, and employs weighted consensus to predict code time complexity, outperforming baselines by at least 10% in accuracy and macro-F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with predicting all code complexity classes effectively, with no single model excelling across all classes. Each model shows advantages in specific complexity classes, indicating the need for a specialized approach.

Method: MEC¬≥O extends multi-agent debate frameworks by assigning LLMs to complexity classes based on performance, providing class-specialized instructions to turn them into experts, conducting structured debates, and integrating predictions through weighted consensus mechanism.

Result: MEC¬≥O achieves at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores than open-source baselines on CodeComplex dataset. It surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and shows competitive F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini.

Conclusion: The multi-expert debate approach with weighted consensus strategy effectively handles code complexity prediction, demonstrating superior performance over individual models and reducing reliance on separate judge models while preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions.

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free inference-time control method that makes flow-based text-to-image models diversity-aware by adding orthogonal stochastic perturbations and feature-space objectives to boost variation without degrading quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample for diverse outputs, which is costly and inefficient. There's a need for diversity-aware generation without compromising quality.

Method: Uses a training-free inference-time control mechanism with: 1) feature-space objective to encourage lateral spread among trajectories, 2) time-scheduled stochastic perturbation projected orthogonal to the generation flow to boost variation without degrading details.

Result: The method consistently improves diversity metrics (Vendi Score, Brisque) across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets while maintaining image quality and prompt alignment. No retraining or base sampler modifications required.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a principled approach to increase diversity in flow-based text-to-image generation through geometric constraints that preserve marginal distribution, offering robust quality maintenance while significantly improving output variation.

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque

*Bicheng Wang,Jinping Wang,Yibo Sue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A higher-order network dynamics identification method using dynamic hypergraph learning and dual-driven prediction for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use simple graphs that only capture pairwise relationships, missing rich non-pairwise structured relationships. First-order GNNs struggle with dynamic non-pairwise relationships, and current models lack either accuracy (theoretical models) or interpretability (data-driven models).

Method: Dynamic hypergraph learning to capture higher-order non-pairwise relationships, combined with a dual-driven dynamic prediction module using Koopman operator theory to transform nonlinear dynamics into linear systems and physical information neural differential equations to ensure compliance with physical laws.

Result: The method demonstrates good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance on both public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by capturing higher-order relationships while maintaining both accuracy and interpretability through the dual-driven framework.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLM agents to optimize persuasive communication in social deduction games, treating dialogue as a Stackelberg competition to strategically influence other players' responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in social deduction games focus on information processing and strategy selection but overlook persuasive communication, which is crucial for influencing other players' beliefs and achieving success in these games.

Method: Formalize turn-based dialogue in social deduction games as a Stackelberg competition, then propose a reinforcement learning framework to train agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact.

Result: The proposed agents significantly outperform baselines across three diverse social deduction games, demonstrating improved persuasive communication capabilities.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending beyond games to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

### [152] [PAC Reasoning: Controlling the Performance Loss for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09133)
*Hao Zeng,Jianguo Huang,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PAC reasoning, a method to dynamically switch large reasoning models between thinking and non-thinking modes while controlling performance loss with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models have high computational costs during deployment, and existing dynamic switching approaches lack statistical guarantees for performance loss, which is critical for high-stakes applications.

Method: Construct an upper confidence bound on performance loss as a monotone function of uncertainty scores, then determine a threshold for switching to non-thinking mode to ensure bounded performance loss.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show the method can save computational budgets while controlling user-specified performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed PAC reasoning method provides distribution-free guarantees for bounded performance loss when dynamically switching between thinking and non-thinking modes, addressing efficiency needs while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

*Emma Kondrup,Anne Imouza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic bias in medical advice generation, with Indigenous and intersex patients receiving less readable and more complex responses, especially in intersectional groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM-generated medical advice may perpetuate health disparities by analyzing responses across different social groups (sex, age, ethnicity).

Method: Exploratory analysis of LLM answers to medical questions across clinical domains, simulating queries from patient profiles varying in sex, age range, and ethnicity, comparing natural language features of responses.

Result: LLMs generate medical advice that systematically differs between social groups - Indigenous and intersex patients receive less readable and more complex advice, with trends amplifying in intersectional groups.

Conclusion: Urgent need for AI developers to investigate and mitigate these systemic biases to prevent unjust patient support, and for higher AI literacy among users.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the computational limits of large language models and reasoning models, particularly their spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, by pushing beyond NP problems to more rigorous PSPACE-complete problems.

Method: Created a benchmark through double-exponential space exploration to construct over a million regex instances with sound filtering, then evaluated 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales on PSPACE-complete regex equivalence and minimization problems.

Result: Extensive evaluations revealed common failure patterns including verbosity and repetition in both LLMs and LRMs, demonstrating their limitations in handling PSPACE-complete problems requiring massive search space exploration.

Conclusion: This work presents the first empirical investigation into spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs using PSPACE-complete problems, offering a new framework for evaluating advanced reasoning capabilities beyond current benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: The research is motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in handling real-world tasks and aims to bridge the performance gap with human capabilities by developing more autonomous and intelligent agents.

Method: The proposed approach integrates four key systems: perception (converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations), reasoning (formulates plans and adapts through techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought), memory (retains knowledge through short-term and long-term mechanisms), and execution (translates decisions into concrete actions).

Result: The paper demonstrates that integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that can perform autonomous and intelligent behavior by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Conclusion: The integration of perception, reasoning, memory, and execution systems enables the development of 'agentic' LLMs that can effectively automate complex tasks and bridge the gap with human capabilities, representing a significant advancement in autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for training LLMs with adjustable representations from localist (interpretable) to distributed (efficient) encodings using a tunable "locality dial" parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Method: Uses group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection to control localization without model retraining.

Result: Provides rigorous mathematical proofs showing explicit threshold conditions where attention concentrates on semantically relevant blocks with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables continuous adjustment between interpretable rule-based representations and efficient distributed encodings through tunable localization control.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform logical reasoning internally, moving beyond statistical learning to examine the underlying computational mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed a small language model solving deductive reasoning tasks, examining internal representations and computational circuits, focusing on induction heads.

Result: Found that induction heads are crucial for implementing rule completion and rule chaining steps in logical inference.

Conclusion: Language models can learn logical reasoning through specific computational mechanisms like induction heads, providing insights into their internal reasoning processes.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces sequence variables in Constraint Programming to overcome limitations of classical successor models in Vehicle Routing Problems, enabling optional visits and insertion heuristics while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical CP models using successor variables struggle with optional visits and insertion-based heuristics in Vehicle Routing Problems, limiting their practical application.

Method: The paper formalizes sequence variables with defined domains, update operations, and consistency levels. It implements these with appropriate data structures for trail-based CP solvers and introduces specialized global constraints for vehicle routing.

Result: Sequence variables successfully simplify problem modeling and demonstrate competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem benchmark.

Conclusion: Sequence variables provide a more flexible and intuitive framework for modeling Vehicle Routing Problems in CP, overcoming limitations of traditional successor models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

TL;DR: This paper reviews LLM-driven agentic systems for radiology, examining their design, applications, evaluation methods, and challenges in automating complex multi-step workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology's multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows make it ideal for LLM-based agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks, moving beyond isolated LLM applications to support complex multi-step workflows.

Method: The review examines the design of LLM-driven agentic systems equipped with external tools and feedback mechanisms, enabling them to drive systems with varying levels of autonomy from semi-automated workflows to adaptive agents managing complex processes.

Result: LLMs and their multimodal variants have demonstrated promising performance for individual radiology tasks like information extraction and report summarization, but their full potential is realized when integrated into agentic systems for complex workflows.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agentic systems show significant promise for radiology but face challenges including error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration that need to be addressed for successful implementation.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT is a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality knowledge graphs from text corpora, forming a scalable neurosymbolic AI system that outperforms large language models in both factual accuracy and semantic validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and interpretability limitations of neurosymbolic AI by creating a system that combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge graphs, overcoming the unreliability of LLM-generated knowledge graphs.

Method: GraphMERT uses a graphical encoder-only model to distill knowledge graphs from unstructured text, creating a modular neurosymbolic stack where neural components learn abstractions and symbolic KGs enable verifiable reasoning.

Result: GraphMERT (80M parameters) significantly outperforms a 32B-parameter LLM baseline, achieving 69.8% FActScore vs 40.2% and 68.8% ValidityScore vs 43.0% on diabetes PubMed data.

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG represents the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with superior symbolic representations, demonstrating that small specialized models can outperform much larger general-purpose LLMs for knowledge graph extraction.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems featuring extensive test cases, designed to address limitations in current coding benchmarks and enable better evaluation of LLM coding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding benchmarks lack exceptionally challenging problems, have insufficient test case coverage, and rely on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. There's a need for more robust evaluation methods for LLM coding capabilities.

Method: Created LiveOIBench with 403 Olympiad-level problems from 72 official Informatics Olympiads (2023-2025), each with ~60 expert-designed test cases. Features include detailed subtask rubrics, elite contestant performance data integration, contamination-free updates, and self-contained offline evaluation system.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 81.76th percentile, strong but below top human contestants (usually above 90th). GPT-OSS-120B achieved only 60th percentile, showing significant capability gap between frontier closed models and open-weight reasoning models.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning models should prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration. Future models need structured analysis and minimized unnecessary exploration. The benchmark reveals significant disparities between top closed models and open-weight alternatives.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
