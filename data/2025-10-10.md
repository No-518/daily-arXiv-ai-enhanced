### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time maritime object detection system using RT-DETR enhanced with synthetic data augmentation, multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and domain adaptation weighting to address small target detection challenges in maritime environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to small target sizes and limited labeled real RGB data, requiring robust solutions for practical deployment.

Method: Uses RT-DETR with multi-scale feature fusion for small vessel detection, uncertainty-minimizing query selection for reliable proposals, and smart weighting between synthetic and real training data to bridge domain gaps. Includes data augmentation for class balancing.

Result: Developed a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline with real-time performance that maintains accuracy under practical limits and extreme conditions. Includes component analysis to quantify each module's contribution.

Conclusion: The system preserves DETR's end-to-end set prediction while allowing speed-accuracy tradeoffs, successfully addressing maritime detection challenges through integrated architectural improvements and domain adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval is a new text-to-video evaluation benchmark that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic camera motion and providing video-level evaluation with 45k human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V benchmarks like VBench and EvalCrafter have two main limitations: they overlook dynamic camera motion essential for cinematic shots, and they aggregate scores at model level rather than video level, making it hard to select better videos for specific prompts.

Method: DynamicEval introduces a benchmark with curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations on 3k videos from 10 T2V models. It evaluates background scene consistency (with improved motion smoothness metric) and foreground object consistency (by tracking points within object instances).

Result: The proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both video and model levels, with an improvement of more than 2 percentage points compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DynamicEval establishes itself as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion, addressing key gaps in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP (Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors) is a principled extension of RED that combines restarting inertia for fast convergence with score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction, achieving faster convergence rates than RED without requiring convex priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RED focus on sophisticated image priors for reconstruction quality but lack principled convergence acceleration. There's a need to bridge the gap between fast convergence and high-quality image recovery in ill-posed imaging inverse problems.

Method: RISP incorporates restarting inertia mechanism for acceleration while maintaining score-based image priors. It extends RED with a principled convergence acceleration approach and connects to heavy-ball ODE dynamics.

Result: RISP achieves faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED without requiring convexity of image prior. Experiments across various imaging inverse problems show fast convergence while maintaining high-quality reconstructions.

Conclusion: RISP successfully bridges the gap between fast convergence and high-quality reconstruction by combining restarting inertia with score-based priors, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Image Purification strategy and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model to address spatial misalignment in ultra-low dose CT denoising, achieving state-of-the-art structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low dose CT reduces radiation but introduces severe noise/artifacts and spatial misalignment with normal dose CT, making existing denoising methods ineffective on real clinical data.

Method: 1) Construct real clinical uLDCT lung dataset; 2) Image Purification strategy to generate aligned uLDCT-NDCT pairs; 3) Frequency-domain Flow Matching model for structure-preserving denoising.

Result: IP strategy significantly boosts multiple denoising models' performance. FFM model with IP achieves SOTA results in anatomical structure preservation on real clinical dataset.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution to data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA is a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks from generative model outputs without needing access to the underlying model, revealing vulnerabilities in current semantic watermarking schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic watermarking methods that embed signals in latent or frequency representations remain vulnerable to attacks, even under resource-constrained adversarial settings, highlighting the need to test and improve watermark robustness.

Method: D2RA projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity, operating as a training-free, single-image attack without requiring model access.

Result: Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes show that D2RA consistently reduces watermark detectability, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in current watermarking designs.

Conclusion: The study reveals that current semantic watermarking schemes have fundamental vulnerabilities that can be exploited by resource-constrained attacks like D2RA, calling for more robust watermarking designs.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle is a video style transfer framework that uses diffusion models with style adapters and synthetic training from paired images, achieving superior temporal coherence and style fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is video style transfer without paired video data for supervision, requiring preservation of video context while applying target styles specified by text prompts.

Method: Uses pretrained video diffusion models with low-rank style adapters in self-attention layers, synthetic training clips from paired images with shared augmentations, and Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) for independent control of style and context.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video style transfer through adapter-based specialization and novel guidance factorization.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRAVL, a fine-tuning method for Video-Language Models to better assess physical plausibility in videos, and ImplausiBench, a benchmark for evaluating physical reasoning in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern video generative models often produce physically implausible sequences that violate causality and physical laws, but there's no robust quantitative method to assess physical realism in videos.

Method: Proposes TRAVL - a fine-tuning recipe combining balanced training data with trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs, plus ImplausiBench benchmark with 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) to isolate visual-temporal understanding.

Result: Existing VLMs struggle with identifying physics violations, exposing limitations in temporal and causal reasoning. TRAVL addresses these limitations through improved motion encoding.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a challenging aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes S3FN, a semantic spectral-spatial fusion network that uses LLM-generated textual descriptions to enhance HSI classification by improving feature-label alignment, achieving significant performance improvements on three benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges with limited training samples, high dimensionality causing overfitting, and most models being monomodal (using only spectral-spatial data), which limits their ability to learn effective decision boundaries.

Method: S3FN uses LLMs to generate class-specific textual descriptions, embeds them using pre-trained text encoders (BERT/RoBERTa), and fuses these semantic embeddings with spectral-spatial data to improve feature-label alignment for classification.

Result: The model achieved significant performance improvements on three HSI benchmark datasets: Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit, demonstrating the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates textual semantics with spectral-spatial data, paving the way for semantically augmented HSI classification models and showing improved performance through better feature-label alignment.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGUL is a lightweight unlearning framework for vision-language models that uses cross-modal attention to identify and transform low-importance visual tokens to prevent sensitive information leakage while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models may memorize and regurgitate private/sensitive information from training data during inference. While machine unlearning addresses this in LLMs, VLMs add complexity due to sensitive information potentially being in both text and visual contexts.

Method: CAGUL utilizes cross-modal attention to identify visual tokens with low importance for output generation, then transforms these tokens using external modules to encode unlearning information without altering pre-trained model parameters.

Result: Experimental results show CAGUL performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines while preventing information leakage and retaining reference model behavior, without requiring model retraining.

Conclusion: CAGUL provides a practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs that is lightweight, efficient, and maintains model performance while preventing sensitive information leakage.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC is an automated maize seedling counting system using UAV imagery and YOLOv9 detection, achieving high accuracy (R^2=0.906) and real-time processing for crop management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize stand counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially for large fields, creating a need for automated solutions to support crop management and yield prediction.

Method: Uses two modes: mosaic image patches and raw video frames aligned with homography matrices. Employs lightweight YOLOv9 model to detect maize seedlings (V2-V10 stages), distinguishes from weeds, and performs row/range segmentation for precise counting.

Result: Strong agreement with manual counts (R^2=0.616 for mosaics, R^2=0.906 for raw frames). Processes 83 frames in 60.63 seconds including inference and post-processing, enabling real-time operation.

Conclusion: MaSC is an effective, scalable, low-cost tool for automated maize stand counting suitable for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) is introduced as a faster alternative to Capsule Networks, achieving 5x faster inference with only marginal accuracy loss by reducing the number of capsules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet has slow training and testing speeds, which limits its use in real-time applications requiring fast inference.

Method: QCN reduces the number of capsules in the network to speed up computation, and also employs a more powerful decoder to enhance performance.

Result: QCN achieves 5x faster inference on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, and Cifar-10 datasets with only a small decrease in accuracy compared to standard CapsNet.

Conclusion: QCN provides a fast CapsNet variant suitable for real-time applications, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++ is an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method that addresses off-manifold drift issues in classifier-free guidance for rectified flow models, ensuring stable performance across various guidance strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard classifier-free guidance (CFG) causes severe off-manifold drift when applied to rectified flow models, leading to visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behavior.

Method: Each inference step performs a conditional rectified flow update to anchor samples near the learned transport path, followed by a weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show consistent outperformance over standard CFG on benchmark datasets including MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ provides a geometry-aware conditioning rule that couples deterministic efficiency with bounded manifold stability, making it a robust alternative to standard CFG for rectified flow models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

### [13] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIT-QMM is a novel Large Multimodal Model for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment that combines text, images, and point clouds to predict quality scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Multimodal Models have advanced image and video quality assessment, their potential for 3D asset quality assessment remains unexplored. The authors aim to leverage complementary information from different modalities (text, 2D projections, 3D views) for point cloud quality evaluation.

Method: Constructed PIT-QMM, a novel LMM capable of consuming text, images, and point clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art by significant margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. The framework also enables distortion localization and identification.

Conclusion: PIT-QMM paves a new way forward for model explainability and interactivity in point cloud quality assessment, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal approaches for 3D quality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DSA Net, a dual-stream alignment network for action segmentation that combines frame-wise and action-wise streams using quantum-classical fusion and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action segmentation methods focus on single-stream approaches modeling spatio-temporal aspects, but recent research shows two-stream methods with action-wise features can enhance performance. The authors aim to investigate the impact of incorporating a second stream of learned action features to capture both action and action-transition cues.

Method: Proposes Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) with two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) that learn a shared feature space through feature alignment. Uses Temporal Context (TC) block with cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM) for fusion. Employs Dual-Stream Alignment Loss with relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses.

Result: DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, EgoProcel) and significantly outperforms existing methods. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: This is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. The dual-stream approach with feature alignment and quantum-classical fusion effectively enhances action segmentation performance.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIE is a video virtual try-on method that uses first-frame clothing replacement and temporal guidance to efficiently synthesize remaining frames, achieving high performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dual-branch architectures in diffusion models require modifying backbone networks and lack temporal characteristics for garments, leading to high parameter counts and additional learning requirements.

Method: Employ image-based clothing transfer for the first frame, then use pose and mask information to guide video generation model's temporal prior for synthesizing remaining frames sequentially under content control of the edited first frame.

Result: Achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining leading performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The OIE approach provides an effective virtual try-on strategy that overcomes challenges in adapting dual-branch architectures to Diffusion Transformer models, offering efficient and high-quality video clothing replacement.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that uses IP-Adapter's automatically generated masks to restrict image tokens to the subject area, allowing text prompts to control the background and improve personalization in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization methods often recreate the subject image while ignoring the text prompt, limiting control over the generated output.

Method: Use IP-Adapter's automatically generated masks during inference to mask image tokens, restricting them to the subject area and allowing text prompts to attend to the background.

Result: The method produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching the prompt, with high prompt and source image alignment compared to other test time personalization methods.

Conclusion: Using automatically generated masks to separate subject and background tokens enables better text prompt control while maintaining subject fidelity in personalized diffusion models.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCIP is a deformable medical image registration model that uses Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) to prevent anatomical misalignment accumulation in pyramid networks and Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy to adaptively determine iteration numbers, achieving SOTA accuracy with comparable speed and compact size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pyramid networks in medical image registration suffer from anatomical misalignment propagation and accumulation in decoders, and existing models lack adaptive iteration control, leading to premature termination or excessive iterations that degrade accuracy.

Method: Proposed Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) with three sequential blocks for anatomical feature extraction, irrelevant feature suppression, and deformation field estimation; and dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy for adaptive iteration determination based on registration stability and convergence assessment.

Result: TCIP outperforms SOTA registration networks on three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset in accuracy while maintaining comparable inference speed and compact parameter size. FERM and TCI also show good generalizability when integrated with existing networks.

Conclusion: The proposed TCIP model effectively addresses anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptive iteration control in medical image registration, achieving superior performance with validated effectiveness through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

TL;DR: A video synthesis method that enables mixed-granularity controls (from exact 4D trajectories to coarse text prompts) using variational inference and multiple generation backbones, with improved controllability and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats, but real video workflows need flexible controls with varying granularity - from precise object trajectories to coarse text prompts.

Method: Cast as variational inference to approximate composed distribution using multiple video generation backbones. Uses step-wise KL divergence minimization over annealed distributions and context-conditioned factorization to reduce solution space modes and avoid local optima.

Result: Produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the need for flexible control in video synthesis while maintaining quality and diversity across different constraint specifications.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,

BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model

fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

TL;DR: MLH is a mutual learning framework that enhances center-based hashing by transferring local similarity knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-based hashing methods capture global data distributions well but underutilize local similarity information, while pairwise methods preserve local similarity but may not capture global structures effectively.

Method: Proposes a weak-to-strong framework with two branches: strong center-based branch and weaker pairwise-based branch, using iterative mutual learning and a novel mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The mutual learning framework effectively combines the strengths of both center-based and pairwise-based approaches, achieving superior performance by leveraging both global and local similarity information.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Method: Proposes Repainter framework integrating spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), modulating attention mechanisms to emphasize background context. Uses composite reward mechanism balancing global, local, and semantic constraints. Also introduces EcomPaint-100K dataset and EcomPaint-Bench benchmark.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions. Effectively reduces visual artifacts and reward hacking while generating higher-reward samples with reduced unwanted object insertion.

Conclusion: Repainter provides an effective solution for e-commerce image inpainting, addressing key challenges in commercial settings through reinforcement learning and comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned generative models suffer from inaccurate 3D priors and struggle with challenging poses and fine details in photorealistic 3D human reconstruction.

Method: Jointly fine-tune multiview generative model (captures fine 2D details) and 3D native generative model (provides structural consistency) using pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention, plus feature injection mechanism to lift 2D details onto 3D shapes.

Result: Achieves robust and photorealistic 3D human reconstruction even for challenging poses, outperforming baselines in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates a promising direction for 3D generation by effectively integrating complementary 2D and 3D generative approaches.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: ComGS is a 3D object-scene composition framework that uses Surface Octahedral Probes for efficient relightable object reconstruction and a diffusion-based approach for environment lighting estimation, achieving real-time rendering at 28 FPS with harmonious visual results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting enables immersive rendering but faces challenges in realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked appearance and shadow information, causing inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes.

Method: Uses Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient lighting/occlusion storage and querying instead of ray tracing, and fine-tunes a diffusion model to complete environment lighting at object placement locations from 360° reconstructed radiance fields.

Result: Achieves 2x speedup in reconstruction, real-time shadow computation, 28 FPS rendering, visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and only 36 seconds for editing operations.

Conclusion: ComGS provides an effective solution for realistic 3D object-scene composition by addressing both relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation challenges, enabling high-quality real-time rendering with efficient editing capabilities.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED is a two-stage framework that reconstructs ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) images from a single short-exposure RAW image, avoiding ghosting artifacts while preserving both highlight and shadow details through exposure correction and brightness-aware denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR scenes with significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions are challenging to capture. RGB bracketing methods suffer from misalignment and ghosting artifacts, while single short-exposure RAW images offer higher bit depth and predictable noise characteristics for better UHDR reconstruction.

Method: A two-stage framework that first performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. Uses only a single short-exposure RAW frame as input.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches for UHDR reconstruction. The method avoids ghosting and motion blur artifacts inherent in multi-exposure approaches.

Conclusion: Single short-exposure RAW images can effectively reconstruct UHDR scenes when processed through the proposed two-stage UltraLED framework, providing a robust solution for dynamic scenes while avoiding alignment issues of bracketing methods.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

*Junhao He,Jiaxu Wang,Jia Li,Mingyuan Sun,Qiang Zhang,Jiahang Cao,Ziyi Zhang,Yi Gu,Jingkai Sun,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework that combines low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams to reconstruct Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), addressing the challenge of large inter-frame motions by using event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging due to large inter-frame motions that increase solution space uncertainty. Event cameras can capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but lack color information. Combining both modalities can address the motion uncertainty challenge.

Method: The framework jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS using RGB and event modalities by: 1) Extracting motion priors from event streams using LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning to adapt an event flow estimator, 2) Using geometry-aware data association to build event-Gaussian motion correspondence, 3) Employing motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes, demonstrating effective optimization of dynamic 3DGS with event data assistance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization, enabling robust reconstruction of Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos by combining them with high-framerate event streams.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating geographic temporal reasoning in VLMs, requiring perspective switching between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple non-overlapping videos, and inference over unobserved regions. Current VLMs perform poorly (34.9% for best model) compared to humans (78.61%), revealing deficiencies in spatial-temporal context utilization, temporal forecasting, and map-video alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks focus on either egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics, but fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is crucial for applications like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: Introduces GTR-Bench, a benchmark for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in large-scale camera networks that requires: multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions unobserved by any video context.

Result: Evaluation of over 10 popular VLMs shows the best proprietary model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves only 34.9% accuracy, significantly lagging behind human performance (78.61%). Analysis reveals three main deficiencies: imbalanced spatial-temporal context utilization, weak temporal forecasting ability, and poor comprehension/alignment of map data with multi-view video inputs.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench provides valuable insights and opens new research opportunities in spatial-temporal intelligence, highlighting significant gaps in current VLMs' geographic temporal reasoning capabilities that need to be addressed for applications in autonomous driving, embodied AI, and general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

### [29] [FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-COF (Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow) representation and FMANet architecture for micro-expression recognition, addressing the limitation of existing methods that only use onset-to-apex optical flow by incorporating both micro-expression phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current micro-expression recognition methods only compute optical flow between onset and apex frames, missing essential motion information from the apex-to-offset phase, which limits recognition performance.

Method: Proposes MM-COF that integrates motion dynamics from both onset-apex and apex-offset phases into a unified descriptor, and FMANet - an end-to-end neural network with learnable modules for dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions.

Result: Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks (MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, SAMM) demonstrate that both MM-COF representation and FMANet outperform existing methods.

Conclusion: The learnable dual-phase framework shows significant potential for advancing micro-expression recognition by capturing comprehensive motion information from both phases of micro-expressions.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RGCNet, a depth estimation framework for 360° indoor panoramas that uses room geometry constraints and background segmentation to improve depth prediction accuracy, particularly for room corners and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods for spherical panoramas focus on pixel-level accuracy but cause oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. The paper aims to address these limitations by incorporating room geometry constraints.

Method: Uses a shared feature encoder with task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Incorporates two strategies: room geometry-based background depth resolving and background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show significantly superior performance compared to current open-source methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates room geometry constraints through layout prediction and background segmentation, achieving improved depth estimation accuracy for 360° indoor panoramas.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP enhances visual prompting with affine and color transformations to address limited expressivity and overfitting, achieving SOTA accuracy among VP methods while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual prompting methods suffer from restricted expressivity of simple additive transformations and overfitting when increasing parameters, leading to lower accuracy compared to other adaptation approaches.

Method: Proposes ACAVP with three complementary transformations: affine transformation for task-specific prompt regions, color transformation for emphasizing relevant features, and additive transformation. Also introduces TrivialAugment data augmentation to mitigate overfitting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and shows superior robustness to distribution shifts across twelve diverse datasets with two model architectures.

Conclusion: ACAVP effectively addresses VP limitations through enhanced expressivity and overfitting mitigation, demonstrating that appropriate data augmentation universally benefits VP training while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

*Kaen Kogashi,Anoop Cherian,Meng-Yu Jennifer Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMHOI is a large-scale multi-human multi-object interaction dataset with complete 3D annotations, and MMHOI-Net is a transformer-based network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling complex human-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human-object interaction benchmarks only consider simple interactions, failing to capture real-world scenarios where multiple humans interact with multiple objects in causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative ways.

Method: MMHOI-Net uses an end-to-end transformer-based neural network with a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance interaction prediction.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MMHOI and CORE4D datasets, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality for multi-human multi-object interaction modeling.

Conclusion: MMHOI provides a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research, and MMHOI-Net demonstrates superior capability in modeling complex real-world human-object interactions through its innovative dual-patch representation and action recognition integration.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ERU framework that combines LLM-based data augmentation, depth maps, and depth-aware decision module to improve embodied reference understanding in ambiguous scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior open-vocabulary object detection methods often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist, requiring better integration of linguistic and embodied cues.

Method: Jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module for robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on two datasets, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.

Conclusion: The proposed ERU framework effectively addresses disambiguation challenges in complex or cluttered environments through multi-modal integration.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and

### [34] [PrismGS: Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing for High-Fidelity Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07830)
*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS is a regularization framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for large urban environments by addressing aliasing artifacts and optimization instability through pyramidal multi-scale supervision and explicit size regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability when scaling to large urban environments, especially under high-resolution (4K) rendering, causing flickering textures and jagged edges due to the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and multi-scale urban geometry.

Method: PrismGS integrates two regularizers: 1) Pyramidal multi-scale supervision that enforces rendering consistency against a pre-filtered image pyramid to learn anti-aliased representations, and 2) Explicit size regularization that imposes physically-grounded lower bounds on 3D Gaussian dimensions to prevent degenerate primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D show PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining superior quality and robustness under 4K rendering.

Conclusion: PrismGS provides a plug-and-play regularization framework that effectively addresses aliasing and stability issues in 3D Gaussian Splatting for large-scale urban environments, enabling high-quality real-time rendering without requiring pipeline modifications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze on the Prize introduces a learnable foveal attention mechanism for visual RL that uses return differences to guide attention toward task-relevant pixels, improving sample efficiency by up to 2.4x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents waste resources on irrelevant pixels in high-dimensional image data, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. Human visual foveation inspired the need for selective attention mechanisms.

Method: Uses return-guided contrastive learning where return differences identify task-relevant features. Groups similar visual representations into positives/negatives based on return differences, creating contrastive triplets to train attention mechanism.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that baseline methods fail to learn, demonstrated across manipulation tasks from ManiSkill3 benchmark without algorithm modifications.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses visual RL inefficiency by learning to focus on task-relevant pixels through return-guided attention, providing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework successfully translates sign language videos directly to speech with competitive performance and immediate communication benefits, making it suitable for educational applications and sign prompt interfaces.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for multi-agent robotic systems under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, where large point clouds degrade system performance.

Method: Decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches, encodes them with semantic-aware encoders using FiLM conditioning, and reconstructs using a folding-based decoder guided by latent features and graph node attributes.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient point cloud transmission for robotic applications, supporting downstream tasks like pose graph optimization and map merging with accuracy comparable to raw LiDAR scans.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS is a novel framework that synergistically optimizes geometry and semantics for sparse-view 3D reconstruction, using semantic priors from 2D foundation models as geometric regularizers to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for semantically rich 3D models is growing for AR/VR and robotics applications, but sparse-view reconstruction remains challenging due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods treat semantics passively rather than as an active guiding force.

Method: AlignGS distills rich priors from 2D foundation models and uses them to directly regularize 3D representation through novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and reconstructions with superior geometric accuracy, validating that semantic priors as geometric regularizers lead to more coherent and complete 3D models from limited views.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic understanding as an active guiding force rather than a passive feature enables more robust sparse-view 3D reconstruction with improved geometric coherence and completeness.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir introduces an imagination-guided memory retrieval system for Vision-and-Language Navigation that uses a world model to generate future state queries for selectively retrieving relevant environmental observations and behavioral patterns, achieving significant performance gains and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-persistent VLN approaches lack effective memory access mechanisms, relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and store only environmental observations while neglecting valuable navigation behavioral patterns that encode decision-making strategies.

Method: 1) Language-conditioned world model that imagines future states for encoding experiences and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints; 3) Experience-augmented navigation model with specialized encoders for integrating retrieved knowledge.

Result: Significant improvements across all 10 testing scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. Analysis shows substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for imagination-guided paradigm.

Conclusion: Predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, validating that imagination-guided memory access with hybrid viewpoint-level storage provides superior performance and efficiency in memory-persistent VLN tasks.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput toxicity testing requires automated evaluation via machine learning models to test large amounts of compounds quickly and cost-effectively.

Method: Used self-supervised learning to learn representations from the EmbryoNet dataset containing ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemical compounds targeting different developmental processes.

Result: The learned representations using self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between the modes-of-action of different compounds.

Conclusion: Demonstrated proof-of-concept for integrating machine learning models in physical toxicity testing devices, as discussed in the TOXBOX project context.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD addresses spatio-temporal imbalance in E2E autonomous driving by predicting residual deviations from inertial references and using point-wise normalization to balance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2EAD systems suffer from spatio-temporal data imbalance, causing models to learn spurious correlations and prioritize uncertain distant predictions over immediate safety.

Method: Proposes ResAD framework with normalized residual trajectory modeling - predicts residual deviations from deterministic inertial references and applies point-wise normalization to re-weight optimization objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on NAVSIM benchmark using vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps.

Conclusion: ResAD significantly simplifies learning task and improves model performance by addressing fundamental optimization challenges in E2E autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

*Haochen Yu,Qiankun Liu,Hongyuan Liu,Jianfei Jiang,Juntao Lyu,Jiansheng Chen,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder is a feedforward model that improves 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenes through unified cylinder camera modeling and hybrid feature representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward reconstruction methods have limited generalization across different camera configurations and struggle with reconstruction accuracy due to sparse views and complex driving scenes.

Method: Proposes a unified cylinder lifting method with: (1) Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) to handle different camera configurations with adjustable parameters, (2) Hybrid representation using Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features to 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings and demonstrates zero-shot generalization to other driving scenes.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder effectively addresses generalization and accuracy limitations in driving scene reconstruction through unified camera modeling and advanced feature lifting techniques.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: MARC is a memory-augmented reinforcement learning framework that compresses video tokens by 95% while maintaining near-baseline accuracy, achieving significant reductions in GPU memory (72%) and latency (23.9%) for video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual language models face heavy computational costs when processing videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Existing token compression methods cause information loss and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes a retrieve-then-compress strategy using Visual Memory Retriever (VMR) to select key clips and Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) framework to distill reasoning ability from teacher to student model.

Result: Achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens, reducing visual tokens by 95%, GPU memory by 72%, and latency by 23.9% across six video benchmarks.

Conclusion: MARC demonstrates potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings like video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods and provide actionable insights for future research directions.

Conclusion: ASBench addresses critical gaps in anomaly synthesis evaluation and offers a systematic framework to advance the field, enabling better quality control in manufacturing through improved synthetic anomaly generation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: TTOM is a training-free framework that improves compositional video generation by aligning video foundation models with spatiotemporal layouts during inference, using optimization and memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Foundation Models struggle with compositional scenarios like motion, numeracy, and spatial relations, creating a need for better text-image alignment in video generation.

Method: TTOM integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by layout-attention objectives, operates in a streaming setting with parametric memory for historical contexts, and supports flexible memory operations (insert, read, update, delete).

Result: TTOM effectively disentangles compositional world knowledge, shows strong transferability and generalization, and achieves better cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation.

Conclusion: TTOM establishes itself as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework for compositional video generation that works on the fly without requiring training.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCast is a precipitation nowcasting model that uses short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss to improve predictions, especially for heavy rainfall.

Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. Existing non-autoregressive approaches have limitations, and the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models needs investigation.

Method: Proposed SimCast with short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Further integrated into CasCast, a diffusion-based framework that combines deterministic predictions with probabilistic modeling to overcome blurriness and distribution shift.

Result: Achieved mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, significantly outperforming existing approaches without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves precipitation nowcasting by combining knowledge distillation techniques with probabilistic modeling, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing

pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed

TL;DR: Latent Harmony is a two-stage VAE framework for UHD image restoration that balances computational efficiency with high-frequency detail retention through latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail preservation in UHD image restoration, overcoming limitations of standard VAEs that discard degradation-specific high-frequency information due to Gaussian constraints.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage One introduces LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints, progressive degradation perturbations, and latent equivariance. Stage Two jointly trains the refined VAE with restoration model using HF-LoRA (High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation) with encoder and decoder LoRA modules trained via alternating optimization and selective gradient propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy with tunable fidelity-perception trade-offs.

Conclusion: Latent Harmony successfully redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by overcoming the efficiency-detail trade-off through joint latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction, enabling flexible fidelity-perception balance.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags are more effective than object tags for image privacy classification when tag budget is limited, but object tags become equally useful when more tags are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which type of tags (object vs abstract) is more suitable for the context-dependent and subjective task of image privacy classification.

Method: Explored and compared the effectiveness of object tags (denoting concrete entities) and abstract tags (capturing higher-level contextual information) for image privacy classification under different tag budget constraints.

Result: Abstract tags are more effective for image privacy classification when the tag budget is limited, while object-related information becomes as useful when a larger number of tags per image is available.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidance for developing more accurate image privacy classifiers by considering the role of tag types and quantity, suggesting that abstract tags should be prioritized in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: Standard lightweight CNN achieves competitive performance (37.4 dB PSNR) vs state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer (39.03 dB PSNR) for low-light image restoration, with 55x smaller size and 13x faster training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance-efficiency trade-off in low-light image restoration, where high computational costs of Transformer models like SwinIR limit practical deployment despite superior performance.

Method: Comparative analysis between state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer model and a standard lightweight CNN for simultaneous high-frequency detail restoration and noise suppression in low-light images.

Result: CNN achieved 37.4 dB PSNR vs SwinIR's 39.03 dB, but with 55x smaller model size and convergence in only 10 epochs vs SwinIR's 132 epochs.

Conclusion: Standard CNNs provide near state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational overhead, making them compelling for resource-constrained real-world applications.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIR-CoT is a retrieval-oriented MLLM that integrates explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve composed image retrieval accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR approaches based on VLMs and MLLMs function as black boxes, preventing users from understanding retrieval rationale and limiting ability to follow complex fine-grained instructions.

Method: Introduces CIR-CoT with explicit CoT reasoning, creates structured CoT annotations through three-stage process (caption, reasoning, conclusion), fine-tunes model to produce structured output before encoding final retrieval intent.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on out-of-domain CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: Establishes new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems by making decision process transparent through explicit reasoning chains.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: Camera-based perception systems in autonomous driving struggle with accurate depth estimation due to the absence of explicit depth information, which leads to ambiguity in 3D object detection.

Method: The proposed RayFusion method leverages ray occupancy information from collaborators to reduce redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays in collaborative visual perception systems.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RayFusion consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and substantially advances collaborative visual perception performance.

Conclusion: RayFusion effectively addresses depth estimation ambiguity in camera-based collaborative perception systems and enhances detection performance through ray-based fusion with collaborators' occupancy information.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

*Bheeshm Sharma,Karthikeyan Jaganathan,Balamurugan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASALoRE is a novel two-stage weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRI that uses discriminative dual prompt tuning to generate pseudo masks and a region-aware spatial attention mechanism with location-based random embeddings for accurate anomaly segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of brain anomaly detection when only weak slice-level labels are available instead of precise pixel-level annotations, which is common in clinical settings.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) generates high-quality pseudo weak masks from slice-level labels; 2) Segmentation network with region-aware spatial attention using fixed location-based random embeddings to focus on anomalous regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while using less than 8 million parameters with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: RASALoRE provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for weakly supervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

*Moon Ye-Bin,Roy Miles,Tae-Hyun Oh,Ismail Elezi,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetouchLLM is a training-free white-box image retouching system that uses interpretable code-based adjustments instead of black-box neural networks, enabling controllable and diverse image enhancements without requiring paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based image retouching approaches require large-scale paired data, operate as black boxes, and lack adaptability for user-specific adjustments. There's a need for more transparent and controllable retouching systems.

Method: The system progressively enhances images through two modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes for retouching operations, mimicking human multi-step retouching.

Result: Experiments show the approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles and enables interpretable, controllable adjustments through natural language interaction.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM provides a training-free, white-box alternative to traditional black-box retouching methods, offering interpretable code-based adjustments that can be tailored to user intent through natural language interaction.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical ResNet architecture for multitemporal time series classification that incorporates class hierarchy constraints to improve discrimination at different semantic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification accuracy for hierarchical land cover classes in time series data by leveraging semantic relationships between classes and handling limited training samples.

Method: Modified ResNet with additional branches for hierarchical classification, using hierarchy-penalty maps to enforce coherent transitions and modular training approach where early layers learn general classes and later layers learn specific classes.

Result: The method achieved accurate classification at micro-class level on Amazonian Forest Sentinel-2 data, with better representation of minority classes and effective generalization across hierarchical levels.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach successfully improves discrimination capabilities, enables modular training, and provides adaptation capability through fine-tuning for new target areas.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

TL;DR: RedFace is a specialized deepfake dataset with 60,000+ images and 1,000+ videos created using 9 commercial platforms to simulate real-world scenarios, revealing limitations of existing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks lack real-world applicability due to limited diversity, restricted manipulation techniques, and reliance on academic generation methods rather than actual commercial tools used 'in the wild'.

Method: Created RedFace dataset using 9 commercial online platforms to generate deepfakes with bespoke algorithms, capturing diverse real-world manipulation techniques and simulating black-box scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications, with cross-domain, intra-domain, and social network dissemination simulations revealing performance gaps.

Conclusion: RedFace bridges the gap between academic evaluations and real-world needs by providing a dataset that better simulates actual deepfake threats, highlighting the need for more robust detection methods that can handle commercial deepfake technologies.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgent need for reliable detection of AI-generated videos (like Sora) that achieve near-perfect visual realism, facing challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle physical law violations.

Method: Develops NSG statistic to quantify ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, uses pre-trained diffusion models for NSG estimation with spatial gradient approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling, and applies Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features for detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, with theoretical proof that generated videos exhibit amplified NSG feature discrepancies due to distributional shifts.

Conclusion: NSG-VD provides an effective physics-driven paradigm for AI-generated video detection, leveraging probability flow conservation principles to identify subtle physical inconsistencies in synthetic videos with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkHash is the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing that embeds backdoor functionality without accessing the training data, maintaining original retrieval accuracy while being resistant to existing defense methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on deep hashing models require access to the training dataset, which is often prohibited in real-world scenarios due to privacy and intellectual property concerns. There is a need for data-free backdoor attacks that can embed backdoors without compromising retrieval accuracy.

Method: Proposes a shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance that fine-tunes only specific layers using a surrogate dataset. Uses topological alignment loss to optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, enhancing attack capability.

Result: Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate high effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Conclusion: DarkHash successfully addresses the challenging problem of data-free backdoor attacks in deep hashing, providing a novel attack framework that maintains retrieval accuracy while being robust against defenses.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Random windowing, a CT-specific augmentation method that leverages Hounsfield Unit distributions to improve liver tumor segmentation, outperforming natural image augmentations that cause artifacts in CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image augmentations developed for natural images are unsuitable for CT scans as they disregard the physical meaning of Hounsfield Units, leading to artifacts and poor generalization in medical image segmentation.

Method: Developed Random windowing augmentation technique that exploits the HU distribution in CT images to encourage robustness to contrast-enhancement variations and improve performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.

Result: The proposed method significantly increases model performance on liver tumor segmentation, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, and shows improved generalization on challenging CT images with poor contrast.

Conclusion: CT-specific augmentation methods like Random windowing are essential for effective deep learning in medical imaging, as they respect the physical properties of CT data and prevent artifacts caused by naive application of natural image augmentations.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

TL;DR: AR-Drag is a reinforcement learning-enhanced autoregressive video diffusion model that enables real-time image-to-video generation with precise motion control using only 1.3B parameters, significantly reducing latency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of real-time motion-controllable video generation, including the latency of bidirectional diffusion models and limitations of existing autoregressive approaches that suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts.

Method: Fine-tunes a base image-to-video model for basic motion control, then enhances it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Uses Self-Rollout mechanism to preserve Markov property and selectively introduces stochasticity in denoising steps to accelerate training.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment while significantly reducing latency compared to state-of-the-art motion-controllable video diffusion models. Works effectively with only 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: AR-Drag represents a significant advancement in real-time motion-controllable video generation, overcoming limitations of existing methods through RL enhancement and efficient autoregressive design.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-LLMs suffer from self-contradictory outputs when answering rephrased questions about videos. The paper identifies that cross-modal attention heads fail to distinguish video tokens across timestamps, and proposes TCAS method to enhance temporal resolution and improve consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts reliability and practical adoption. In Video-LLMs, this manifests as inconsistent responses to rephrased questions based on video content, but the underlying causes remain underexplored.

Method: Proposed Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) - an attention enhancement method that constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to improve the model's temporal resolution capability and temporal understanding logic consistency.

Result: Experimental results show the method significantly enhances temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Interpretability analyses confirm improved temporal discriminability of attention heads. The method also achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency through TCAS, the method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding, validating that improving attention mechanisms can address self-contradiction issues in Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

TL;DR: UniMMVSR is a unified generative video super-resolution framework that incorporates hybrid-modal conditions (text, images, videos) to enhance fidelity in multi-modal video generation, outperforming existing methods and enabling 4K video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cascaded video super-resolution methods are limited to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation.

Method: The framework explores condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model, with distinct data construction and condition utilization methods for different condition types (text, images, videos).

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and higher conformity to multi-modal conditions, and enables multi-modal guided generation of 4K video when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: The proposed UniMMVSR framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating hybrid-modal conditions, demonstrating superior performance and enabling previously unattainable 4K video generation capabilities.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

TL;DR: MURE is a multimodal reasoning framework for image editing that uses interleaved text-image chain-of-thought reasoning to handle complex object intersections and spatial relationships, achieving higher precision than text-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained spatial relationships due to lack of explicit visual reasoning and visual cues for pixel-level details.

Method: Proposes MURE framework with interleaved text-image CoT reasoning, where textual descriptions are followed by visual cues like positional masks. Introduces Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) to prune low-quality reasoning paths using reward model scores.

Result: Method achieves significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks, decomposes complex tasks into precise sub-tasks, and yields high-fidelity edited results.

Conclusion: Shifting from purely text-based reasoning to multimodal interleaved text-image reasoning enables more precise and high-quality image editing, addressing limitations of existing methods in handling complex visual relationships.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bootstrapping algorithm for fine-grained visual classification that iteratively re-aligns training samples to handle geometric biases without requiring aligned training data, outperforming equivariant and canonicalization baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification tasks require sensitivity to subtle visual cues while being robust to spatial transformations. Existing methods rely on heavy data augmentation (demanding powerful models) or equivariant architectures (constraining expressivity), while canonicalization methods assume aligned training data which real-world datasets never fulfill.

Method: A bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. The method establishes convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups.

Result: The method consistently outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines on four FGVC benchmarks while performing on par with augmentation-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed bootstrapping approach provides an effective alternative to existing methods for handling geometric biases in fine-grained visual classification, overcoming the limitations of both equivariant architectures and canonicalization methods that require aligned training data.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

### [68] [InstructUDrag: Joint Text Instructions and Object Dragging for Interactive Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08181)
*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag is a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging for simultaneous object relocation and text-based image editing, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning while object dragging methods are limited to static relocation. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by integrating both approaches.

Method: The framework treats object dragging as image reconstruction with two synergistic branches: moving-reconstruction branch using energy-based gradient guidance for accurate object movement, and text-driven editing branch sharing gradient signals for consistent transformations. Uses DDPM inversion and prior information injection to preserve object structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show that InstructUDrag enables flexible, high-fidelity image editing with precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully combines text instructions with object dragging, providing both precise object positioning and semantic editing capabilities in a unified approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual is a tri-stage method for dual-human motion generation that models dynamic hierarchical interactions from individual to inter-individual levels, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring the dynamic nature of motion changes with distance and the hierarchical structure from individual to inter-individual to overall motion.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Self-Learning Stage uses LLM to divide dual-human text into individual texts and align features; 2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicts interaction distance and models interactions dynamically; 3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage uses overall text features to refine motion features.

Result: Extensive evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that FineDual outperforms existing approaches in generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.

Conclusion: FineDual effectively models dynamic hierarchical human interaction by exploiting the inherent dynamic and hierarchical properties of human interaction.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

*Chenying Liu,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AdaGC, a novel framework for single-positive multi-label learning in remote sensing that uses adaptive gradient calibration to handle supervision ambiguity and label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification provides better semantic understanding of remote sensing imagery but complete annotations are expensive. Single-positive multi-label learning is more scalable but introduces supervision ambiguity that requires specialized solutions.

Method: AdaGC framework with gradient calibration mechanism combined with Mixup and dual EMA module for robust pseudo-label generation. Uses adaptive triggering of GC based on training dynamics after warm-up stage.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets under different label noise types show AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AdaGC effectively bridges the gap in SPML research for remote sensing, providing a generalizable framework that handles supervision ambiguity and label noise while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

### [71] [One Stone with Two Birds: A Null-Text-Null Frequency-Aware Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08273)
*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NTN-Diff is a novel diffusion model for text-guided image inpainting that addresses semantic consistency between masked and unmasked regions by decomposing frequency bands and using null-text guidance during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods failed to simultaneously preserve unmasked regions and achieve semantic consistency between masked and unmasked areas due to entanglement of frequency bands with different robustness to text prompts.

Method: Proposes null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion model that decomposes denoising into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, disentangling mid-and-low frequency bands and using stable mid-frequency as guidance for null-text denoising of low-frequency in masked regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models for text-guided image inpainting, achieving better semantic consistency while preserving unmasked regions.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff successfully addresses the dual challenges of text-guided inpainting by frequency band decomposition and staged denoising with null-text guidance, providing superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

*Michael Niemeyer,Fabian Manhardt,Marie-Julie Rakotosaona,Michael Oechsle,Christina Tsalicoglou,Keisuke Tateno,Jonathan T. Barron,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) is a novel technique that learns a neural field to predict optimal exposure values per 3D point, enabling robust 3D reconstruction and view synthesis in challenging high dynamic range scenarios with varying exposure conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural scene representations degrade when dealing with real-world data containing per-image variations like strong exposure changes, which commonly occur in scenes with indoor/outdoor areas or rooms with windows.

Method: Proposes learning a neural field that predicts optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling joint optimization of scene representation and exposure field through a novel neural conditioning mechanism. This generalizes the camera's per-image exposure selection to 3D space.

Result: The approach trains faster than prior works and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines. It enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios without requiring post-processing or multi-exposure captures.

Conclusion: NExF provides a robust solution for 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis in challenging real-world conditions with varying exposure, outperforming existing methods significantly while being more efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LTCA mechanism for referring video segmentation that balances locality and globality through stacked sparse local attentions and global query interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods fail to balance locality and globality in temporal context extraction, with computation complexity increasing significantly with video length.

Method: LTCA mechanism with stacked sparse local attentions using dilated window attention and random global key selection, plus global query interaction.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on four benchmarks with 11.3% and 8.3% improvements on MeViS datasets.

Conclusion: LTCA effectively balances locality and globality in temporal context modeling for referring video segmentation.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic-grounded learning paradigm called Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) that transfers rich semantic knowledge from 2D Vision Foundation Models to 3D domain for affordance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D affordance segmentation rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking intrinsic challenges of 3D data like sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity, leading to features that lack clear functional boundaries.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) pre-training strategy that aligns 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity. Then designs Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST) that integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.

Conclusion: The semantic-grounded learning paradigm effectively bridges the gap between 2D semantic knowledge and 3D functional understanding, enabling precise affordance segmentation for robotic manipulation and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is an efficient post-training framework that replaces self-attention with linear attention in video diffusion models to reduce quadratic computation costs while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have high computation costs due to quadratic complexity of self-attention, and existing linear attention approaches require expensive pretraining and have limited expressiveness.

Method: Uses selective transfer to automatically identify replaceable layers and converts them to linear attention, plus an anytime distribution matching objective to align sample distributions across timesteps efficiently.

Result: Achieves 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving quality, with 4-step distilled model achieving 15.92x latency reduction with minimal quality drop.

Conclusion: LinVideo provides an effective data-free post-training approach to reduce computation costs in video diffusion models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTPQA is the first VQA benchmark focused on perception-based questions in traffic scenes with distance annotations, showing small VLMs significantly underperform humans (~60% vs ~85% accuracy) on traffic perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable perception systems for automated driving that can handle both close and long-range objects, since critical traffic elements are often at distance and safety-critical applications require trustworthy perception.

Method: Created DTPQA benchmark with distance-annotated perception questions in traffic scenes, excluding reasoning questions to isolate perception capabilities. Evaluated several state-of-the-art small VLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Small VLMs significantly underperformed humans (~60% average accuracy vs ~85% human performance), with specific challenges in tasks like distinguishing left from right. Human sample size was relatively small, imposing statistical limitations.

Conclusion: Current small VLMs have significant limitations in traffic perception capabilities, particularly for distance-related tasks and directional discrimination, highlighting the need for improved perception systems for automated driving applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for hyperspectral land-cover classification face overfitting risks when trained on small labeled datasets, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses guided diffusion model for data augmentation, lightweight transformer network for complex pattern capture, modified weighted loss function, and optimized cosine variance scheduler for efficient training on small datasets.

Result: Outperforms other data augmentation techniques in forest classification with 10 forest types using PRISMA satellite hyperspectral images, achieving better average and weighted average accuracy with stable training behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses overfitting in small datasets and enables practical application of deep generative models for hyperspectral data augmentation.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are largely limited to the image domain, lacking similar capabilities for video generation and editing tasks.

Method: Dual-stream design combining Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding and Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation, with joint training across multiple video tasks.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and editing. Enables task composition and generalization to unseen editing instructions without explicit training.

Conclusion: UniVideo successfully extends unified multimodal modeling to video domain, demonstrating strong performance across diverse tasks and enabling novel capabilities through task composition and generalization.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

TL;DR: Proposes LFC, a curriculum-based source-free domain adaptation framework that uses easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula to progressively adapt models to target domains without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data privacy concerns in medical imaging by enabling domain adaptation without source data access, while improving learning procedure through progressive adaptation.

Method: Uses two curricula: easy-to-hard (starts with easy samples, gradually increases difficulty) and source-to-target (ensures smooth domain transition). Evaluated on fundus and polyp segmentation tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain medical image segmentation datasets, surpassing existing source-free domain adaptation approaches.

Conclusion: The curriculum-based approach effectively enables progressive knowledge transfer in source-free domain adaptation, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

*Zeqing Wang,Xinyu Wei,Bairui Li,Zhen Guo,Jinrui Zhang,Hongyang Wei,Keze Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoVerse is a new benchmark for Text-to-Video (T2V) models that evaluates temporal causality and world knowledge understanding, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks through 300 curated prompts across 10 evaluation dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V benchmarks are insufficient for state-of-the-art models as they fail to evaluate temporal causality and world knowledge - crucial components for building "world models". Existing benchmarks focus on outdated metrics like per-frame quality and lack systematic assessment of real-world understanding.

Method: Collected diverse videos across multiple domains, extracted event-level descriptions with temporal causality, and rewrote them into T2V prompts. Designed binary evaluation questions across 10 dimensions covering dynamic and static properties. Developed a human-preference-aligned QA evaluation pipeline using vision-language models.

Result: Created VideoVerse benchmark with 300 curated prompts involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Systematically evaluated both open-source and closed-source T2V models to assess their capabilities in understanding complex temporal causality and world knowledge.

Conclusion: VideoVerse provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate how close current T2V generators are to achieving world model capabilities, highlighting the gap in temporal causality understanding and real-world knowledge that needs to be addressed in future T2V development.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

### [83] [Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08431)
*Kaiwen Zheng,Yuji Wang,Qianli Ma,Huayu Chen,Jintao Zhang,Yogesh Balaji,Jianfei Chen,Ming-Yu Liu,Jun Zhu,Qinsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces rCM, a score-regularized continuous-time consistency model that scales consistency distillation to large-scale text-to-image and video diffusion models up to 14B parameters, achieving high-fidelity generation in 1-4 steps with 15-50x speedup while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of continuous-time consistency models (sCM) in large-scale applications, particularly their quality issues in fine-detail generation due to error accumulation and mode-covering nature, and to enable practical deployment of consistency distillation for billion-parameter diffusion models.

Method: Developed a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel for efficient training, then proposed rCM which integrates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer to combine the mode-covering forward divergence of sCM with mode-seeking reverse divergence for improved visual quality.

Result: rCM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art DMD2 on quality metrics while offering better diversity, achieves 15-50x speedup in diffusion sampling, generates high-fidelity samples in 1-4 steps, and scales to models with 14B parameters and 5-second videos without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches.

Conclusion: rCM provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for large-scale diffusion distillation, successfully addressing quality limitations of previous methods while maintaining generation diversity and enabling efficient deployment of billion-parameter diffusion models.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework for spatial image processing that integrates grayscale quantization, color/brightness enhancement, image sharpening, bidirectional transformation, and geometric feature extraction, achieving robust performance for real-time image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive spatial image processing framework that can handle multiple image enhancement and analysis tasks in a modular and deterministic manner for real-time computer vision applications.

Method: Uses grayscale quantization (8 levels), histogram equalization in RGB/YCrCb spaces, HSV brightness adjustment, 3x3 convolution kernel sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipeline with unsharp masking/gamma correction/noise amplification, and geometric feature extraction using Canny edge detection, Hough transform, Harris corner detection, and morphological operations.

Result: Achieved 76.10% forward and 74.80% reverse transformation accuracy, 51.50° billiard cue alignment accuracy, and 81.87% similarity for cue isolation against ground truth. Demonstrated robust performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The modular framework provides deterministic and robust image processing capabilities suitable for real-time computer vision applications, with validated performance across multiple enhancement and analysis tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-STAR is a framework for open-vocabulary action recognition that decomposes actions into sub-motions and uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning to reduce cross-modal hallucination and improve fine-grained action discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs rely too heavily on text-centric priors, limiting their ability to distinguish semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios.

Method: The approach decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching and dynamically invokes domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, using hierarchical reinforcement learning that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets, with superior ability to distinguish fine-grained actions and handle cross-modal hallucination.

Conclusion: Video-STAR successfully enables category-specific reasoning capacity and reduces cross-modal hallucination by transitioning from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference through sub-motion decomposition and tool-augmented reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmark evaluates vision-language models on sign language iconicity tasks, showing VLMs perform below humans on phonological form prediction and transparency, with moderate correlation on iconicity ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test vision-language models' ability to recover essential mappings from dynamic human motion in signed languages, using iconicity as a natural testbed for visual grounding.

Method: Introduced the Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmark with three tasks: phonological sign-form prediction, transparency (inferring meaning from form), and graded iconicity ratings. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art VLMs on Sign Language of the Netherlands in zero- and few-shot settings.

Result: VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance on phonological form prediction; perform far from human baselines on transparency; and only top models correlate moderately with human iconicity ratings. Models with better phonological prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment.

Conclusion: The findings validate diagnostic tasks for iconicity and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

TL;DR: InstructX is a unified framework for image and video editing that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with diffusion models, enabling instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks without explicit video supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices and the challenge of integrating MLLMs with diffusion models for difficult tasks like video editing, while overcoming the scarcity of video training data.

Method: Conducts comprehensive study on MLLM-diffusion model integration, leverages emergent video editing capabilities from image training, and incorporates modality-specific MLLM features to unify image and video editing in a single model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across broad range of image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that image training enables video editing without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies image and video editing, showing emergent video capabilities from image data and effective modality-specific feature integration for comprehensive editing performance.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: MoA-VR is a Mixture-of-Agents Video Restoration system that uses three coordinated agents (Degradation Identification, Routing/Restoration, and Quality Assessment) to handle complex video degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos suffer from complex degradations (noise, compression artifacts, low-light) but existing methods require manual model selection or use monolithic architectures that don't generalize well across different degradation types.

Method: Three-agent system: 1) VLM-based degradation identifier using new benchmark, 2) LLM-powered self-adaptive router that learns restoration strategies, 3) VLM-based video quality assessment using new Res-VQ dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning for general-purpose video restoration, mimicking human professional reasoning processes.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

TL;DR: The paper identifies ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens in Vision Transformers that encapsulate high-level semantic concepts. These tokens are crucial for visual reasoning in LVLMs but are often overlooked in existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While existing works focus on attention sinks in LLMs, this paper shifts focus to vision encoders by identifying ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens that carry important semantic information but are underutilized in current LVLM architectures.

Method: The authors conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of ViT sink tokens, and propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage these tokens for improved visual reasoning.

Result: By explicitly utilizing ViT attention sink tokens, the paper demonstrates substantial improvements across various LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, showing enhanced understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks represent untapped potential in LVLMs, and properly leveraging these high-semantic visual tokens can significantly enhance visual reasoning performance across different model architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning small random subnetworks (slices) in pre-trained models works well due to universal winning slice property from spectral balance and high task energy, leading to SliceFine method that matches SOTA PEFT performance with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical foundation for why parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) works by explaining why updating only small subnetworks can achieve good downstream performance, and to develop a more efficient PEFT method based on this understanding.

Method: Proposed theoretical framework showing pre-trained models have universal winning slice property (spectral balance + high task energy), then developed SliceFine method that updates only selected slices of original weights without adding new parameters.

Result: SliceFine matches state-of-the-art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness.

Conclusion: The work bridges theory and practice by providing theoretical foundation for PEFT and offering SliceFine as a theoretically grounded, efficient alternative to existing PEFT techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: To enable more flexible and controllable image-to-video generation with trajectory control that works under both aligned and unaligned conditions, overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on token concatenation or ControlNet approaches.

Method: Uses a unified point-based motion representation with segmentation ID, trajectory ID, and optional color channel. Employs sequence-concatenation scheme for trajectory conditioning and annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned conditions.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. Enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for various applications.

Conclusion: FlexTraj provides a flexible and efficient framework for trajectory-controlled video generation that supports diverse applications including motion cloning, drag-based editing, motion interpolation, camera redirection, and mesh animations.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to attempting direct learning without establishing hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: (1) spatial perception via object localization, (2) spatial understanding through multi-dimensional tasks, (3) complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, using the SpatialLadder-26k dataset.

Result: Achieves 23.4% average improvement over base model, surpasses GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%, with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence in VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only instruction-based image editing lacks fine-grained control over edit extent, limiting users' ability to make gradual adjustments from subtle to strong edits.

Method: Extends state-of-the-art editing model with lightweight projector network that maps scalar edit strength and instruction to modulation coefficients; trains on synthesized quadruplet dataset using generative models with quality filtering.

Result: Enables unified fine-grained control over edit strength across diverse operations (stylization, attribute, material, background, shape changes) without attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext provides continuous control over edit strength in instruction-driven image editing, offering smooth transitions from no change to fully realized results across various editing operations.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

*Xiangyu Zhao,Junming Lin,Tianhao Liang,Yifan Zhou,Wenhao Chai,Yuzhe Gu,Weiyun Wang,Kai Chen,Gen Luo,Wenwei Zhang,Junchi Yan,Hua Yang,Haodong Duan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-chain reflective reasoning by creating a benchmark (MM-HELIX), generating training data (MM-HELIX-100K), and proposing a novel training strategy (AHPO) that significantly improves reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show proficiency in reasoning tasks but lack capability for long-chain reflective reasoning, which is essential for solving complex real-world problems. This gap remains largely unexplored.

Method: 1) Created MM-HELIX benchmark with 1,260 synthetic tasks requiring iterative thinking; 2) Developed Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K dataset; 3) Proposed Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) that dynamically combines offline supervision and online optimization to address sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, the method achieved +18.6% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrated strong generalization with +5.7% average performance gain on general mathematical and logic tasks.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs that can handle complex real-world problems requiring iterative thinking and backtracking.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cultural awareness in Video Large Language Models, containing over 1000 video-norm pairs from US and Chinese cultures with socio-cultural norm annotations based on speech act theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VideoLLMs are deployed globally, they need to understand cultural backgrounds, but current benchmarks don't adequately assess cultural awareness.

Method: Used human-AI collaboration framework where a teacher model provides candidate annotations and human experts validate/correct them, creating VideoNorms benchmark with norm adherence/violation labels and verbal/non-verbal evidence.

Result: Benchmarking revealed models perform worse on norm violations than adherence, worse on Chinese culture vs US culture, struggle with non-verbal evidence and identifying exact norms, and perform worse in formal contexts unlike humans.

Conclusion: There's a critical need for culturally-grounded video language model training, which this benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARTDECO is a unified framework for real-time 3D reconstruction that combines feed-forward models' efficiency with SLAM-based pipelines' reliability, using 3D foundation models and Gaussian decoders for interactive performance with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between per-scene optimization (high fidelity but computationally expensive) and feed-forward foundation models (real-time but less accurate and robust). ARTDECO aims to bridge this gap for on-the-fly 3D reconstruction.

Method: ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. It employs a hierarchical Gaussian representation with LoD-aware rendering strategy to maintain fidelity and efficiency at scale.

Result: Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show ARTDECO delivers interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity, bridging the gap between efficiency and quality in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

### [97] [VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555)
*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCanvas enables arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion by allowing users to place patches anywhere in space and time, unifying various video generation tasks. It solves temporal ambiguity in latent video diffusion models using zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for flexible video generation that can handle arbitrary user-specified patches at any spatial location and timestamp, overcoming the temporal ambiguity issues in current latent video diffusion models.

Method: Proposes VideoCanvas framework with hybrid conditioning: spatial placement via zero-padding and temporal alignment through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, enabling pixel-frame-aware control on frozen backbone models without new parameters.

Result: VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms and establishes state-of-the-art performance in flexible video generation, as demonstrated on the new VideoCanvasBench benchmark.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of temporal ambiguity in latent video diffusion models, providing a unified and flexible solution for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Result: Evaluation shows significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art LMMs (including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL), indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench provides valuable insights and clear direction for future LMM development, aiming to drive the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists for scientific applications.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific

significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating

analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \modelname{} is a video inbetweening framework that enables multi-modal controls including depth transition, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions for precise video interpolation, achieving better motion generation and user control than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inbetweening methods cannot generate large, complex motions, lack versatility for user intents, and provide insufficient fine control over intermediate frames, leading to misalignment with creative vision.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture with multi-modal controls mapped to sparse point-based representation. Separates content and motion controls into two branches with stage-wise training to ensure smooth learning of controls.

Result: Extensive experiments show that multi-modal controls enable more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narratives compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing video inbetweening methods by providing flexible multi-modal controls while maintaining precision and ease of use for fine-grained video interpolation.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: The paper proposes NaViL, a native multimodal large language model trained end-to-end, exploring optimal architecture and scaling properties between vision encoders and LLMs under data constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs use compositional training with separate vision and language components, making it difficult to explore multimodal scaling properties. The authors aim to study native end-to-end training of MLLMs.

Method: Systematically study design space and scaling properties of native MLLMs under data constraints, identify optimal meta-architecture, and propose NaViL with a cost-effective training recipe.

Result: Found positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. NaViL achieves competitive performance on 14 multimodal benchmarks compared to existing MLLMs.

Conclusion: The findings provide in-depth insights for future native MLLM research, demonstrating the effectiveness of end-to-end training and the importance of balanced scaling between vision and language components.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: D²GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting under sparse-view conditions by addressing overfitting near cameras and underfitting in distant areas through adaptive dropout and fidelity enhancement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods suffer from performance degradation and instability under sparse-view conditions, with specific failure modes of overfitting in camera-proximal regions and underfitting in distant areas.

Method: Proposes D²GS framework with two components: Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout to mask redundant Gaussians, and Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement for improving reconstruction in far-field areas. Also introduces a new metric for Gaussian distribution stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D²GS effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS through targeted solutions for overfitting and underfitting, with demonstrated performance improvements and new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and high cost of manual annotation for training vision language models as controllers with tool-use capabilities.

Method: Pipeline that constructs M-TRACE dataset (28.5K multimodal tasks, 177K trajectories) for imitation-based tuning, develops MATRIX Agent controller, and generates Pref-X (11K preference pairs) for step-wise preference learning.

Result: MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs across three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA), demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable training of VLM controllers through automated trajectory synthesis and preference learning, achieving superior performance in multimodal tool-use reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating

TL;DR: ReSplat is a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians using rendering error as feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward Gaussian splatting models are limited by single-pass inference. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by introducing iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation.

Method: Uses recurrent network with rendering error as feedback signal to iteratively update Gaussians. Initializes with compact reconstruction model in 16× subsampled space, producing 16× fewer Gaussians than per-pixel models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions (256×256 to 540×960), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K). Significantly reduces number of Gaussians and improves rendering speed.

Conclusion: ReSplat demonstrates that rendering error serves as effective feedback for iterative Gaussian refinement, enabling robust generalization to unseen data with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) is a verification-oriented decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases using semantic guards at decode time, reducing hallucinations without sacrificing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between large-scale empirical language models and formal verification by ensuring generated text aligns with knowledge bases and reduces factual errors.

Method: Uses constraint-based semantics with semantic guards operating at decode time, proof of greedy selection properties, entropy-style invariant for factual risk quantification, and multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts.

Result: Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that TAD guardrails reduce hallucinations while maintaining throughput, providing a practical verification approach.

Conclusion: TAD offers a pragmatic bridge between empirical language models and formal verification, enabling knowledge-aligned generation with reduced factual errors.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

TL;DR: L2M-AID is an autonomous industrial defense framework that combines LLMs with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and respond to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks while maintaining operational stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional industrial defense systems lack contextual awareness and struggle with sophisticated multi-stage attacks in IIoT environments, requiring a more adaptive and resilient security approach.

Method: Uses LLMs as semantic bridges to translate unstructured telemetry into contextual state representations, combined with MAPPO multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn cooperative defense strategies while balancing security and operational objectives.

Result: Achieved 97.2% detection rate, reduced false positives by over 80%, improved response times by 4x, and demonstrated superior performance in maintaining physical process stability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: L2M-AID presents a robust new paradigm for securing critical infrastructure by effectively combining LLM reasoning with multi-agent reinforcement learning for adaptive industrial defense.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinking models like DeepSeek R1 outperform base models not by learning new reasoning capabilities, but by learning to deploy pre-existing base model reasoning mechanisms at the right time. A hybrid model that activates base model reasoning mechanisms strategically can recover up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether thinking models develop entirely new reasoning capabilities or simply learn to better utilize pre-existing base model capabilities through more efficient deployment timing.

Method: Proposed a hybrid model that activates reasoning mechanisms in base models at optimal times to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains. Used an unsupervised, bottom-up approach to uncover human-interpretable reasoning behaviors without manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Tested on three base and four thinking models using GSM8K and MATH500 datasets.

Result: The hybrid model recovered up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. This demonstrates that base models already possess the necessary reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Thinking models primarily learn efficient deployment of pre-existing reasoning mechanisms acquired during pre-training, rather than developing fundamentally new capabilities. Post-training teaches models when to deploy these mechanisms effectively.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [107] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from static mental health assessments to continuous AI-driven monitoring, using ADHD as a case study. It introduces mental health digital twins (MHDTs) as computational models for personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static diagnostic assessments are inadequate for dynamic mental health conditions. There are capacity constraints in neuropsychology that limit personalized and longitudinal care.

Method: Advocates for continuous AI-driven assessment using generative AI for frequent experience sampling and diagnostic reconciliation. Proposes mental health digital twins as computational models that capture individual symptom dynamics.

Result: The framework enables more personalized care pathways, improves accessibility and treatment efficacy through continuous data sampling that adapts to evolving patient needs.

Conclusion: AI-driven continuous assessment and mental health digital twins represent a transformative approach to mental health care that can address current limitations and provide dynamic, patient-centered treatment.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA is a modular multi-agent framework that enables iterative problem solving through exploration and dynamic plan evolution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on reasoning-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents are limited to static planning and brittle interactions, lacking true collaboration or adaptive reasoning capabilities needed for complex problem solving.

Method: ProSEA uses a hierarchical architecture with a Manager Agent orchestrating domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposing tasks, and adaptively replanning based on structured feedback from failed attempts that includes detailed failure reasons and newly discovered constraints.

Result: On the FinanceBench benchmark, ProSEA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks, even without human feedback.

Conclusion: ProSEA demonstrates potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents through its dynamic plan refinement and exploratory learning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+ enhances traffic forecasting by integrating physical road topology with data-driven features through a novel SpatioSemantic Expert, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer, strategically selected experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mixture of experts frameworks like TESTAM lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial modeling capabilities in traffic forecasting.

Method: TESTAM+ introduces a SpatioSemantic Expert that integrates physical road topology with data-driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction, and uses strategic expert selection rather than naive ensemble aggregation.

Result: Achieved 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). The optimal configuration achieved 11.5% MAE reduction vs MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38) with 53.1% lower inference latency.

Conclusion: Fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi-expert ensembles, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with superior computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a time series reasoning agent that uses LLMs for evidence gathering and reasoning while delegating statistical analysis to specialized tools, achieving improved performance on reasoning tasks compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with time series reasoning tasks, suffering from hallucination and knowledge leakage issues when dealing with temporal data.

Method: TS-Agent uses LLMs for evidence gathering and step-by-step reasoning while employing time series analytical tools for statistical and structural information extraction. It interacts with raw numeric sequences through atomic operators, maintains an evidence log, and uses self-critique with quality gates.

Result: TS-Agent achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks and delivers significant improvements on reasoning tasks where existing models rely on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves time series native form, ensures interpretability, and mitigates knowledge leakage and hallucination in time series reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT can effectively understand BPMN process models from images and answer queries about them at syntactic, logical, and semantic levels, making them valuable assistants for business process designers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to understand process models, find errors, and reason with them through natural language interfaces.

Method: Empirical analysis of several LLMs including ChatGPT (model o3) in zero-shot settings, testing their ability to interpret BPMN process models from images and answer queries.

Result: Vanilla LLMs can effectively understand BPMN process models and answer queries intelligently at multiple levels of depth, though performance varies across different models. LLMs exhibit anthropomorphic properties in their reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can play a valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users, demonstrating capabilities in process analysis and optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: This paper formalizes risk reduction optimization for Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) under EU AI Act requirements, comparing MIP, SAT, and CP approaches using Minizinc modeling to find balanced ethical risk assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIS are classified as high-risk systems under EU AI Act, requiring formal risk management to ensure compliance with trustworthy AI ethical requirements, necessitating optimization methods for risk reduction.

Method: Formalized risk reduction as constrained optimization problem, modeled with Minizinc constraint modeling language, and compared three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming (CP).

Result: Conducted comparative experimental study analyzing performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach, identifying methodological limits.

Conclusion: Proposes integration of Minizinc model into complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS as future work direction.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM is a multi-agent LLM framework that solves popular path queries using a two-stage pipeline (SEARCH and GENERATE) without requiring model training or retraining for data updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for popular path queries require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining for data updates. LLMs show promise for spatial reasoning but need specialized frameworks for geo-spatial problems.

Method: Two-stage multi-agent pipeline: SEARCH stage identifies popular paths from historical data, GENERATE stage synthesizes novel paths when no existing paths are found in the data.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in SEARCH stage and competitive performance in GENERATE stage while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: CompassLLM successfully leverages LLM reasoning capabilities for geo-spatial problems, providing an effective alternative to traditional methods that require extensive training and retraining.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [115] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate suffers from identity bias where agents show sycophancy (uncritically adopting peers' views) or self-bias (stubbornly adhering to their own views). The paper proposes response anonymization to remove identity markers and introduces the Identity Bias Coefficient to measure bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent debate systems are undermined by identity-driven biases where agents don't reason neutrally but instead show sycophancy or self-bias based on source identity, compromising debate reliability.

Method: 1) Formalize debate dynamics as identity-weighted Bayesian update process; 2) Propose response anonymization by removing identity markers from prompts; 3) Define Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC) to measure bias.

Result: Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm widespread identity bias, with sycophancy being far more common than self-bias. Anonymization effectively reduces bias.

Conclusion: Identity masking is essential for multi-agent debate systems to ensure reasoning is based on content rather than source identity, improving the reliability of debate outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI evaluation methods are flawed due to data contamination, selective reporting, and inadequate quality control, leading to unreliable benchmarks. This paper proposes PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored evaluation framework with sealed execution, item banking, and delayed transparency to restore trust in AI assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI has created a 'Wild West' of evaluation where current benchmarks reveal critical vulnerabilities, data contamination and selective reporting fuel hype, and inadequate quality control leads to biased assessments. This ambiguity erodes public confidence and makes it difficult to distinguish genuine progress from exaggerated claims.

Method: The paper introduces PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored evaluation blueprint featuring: sealed execution to prevent data leakage, item banking with rolling renewal to maintain test integrity, and delayed transparency to balance openness with security. This framework aims to be robust by construction rather than relying on goodwill.

Result: The proposed PeerBench framework addresses systemic flaws in current AI evaluation by creating a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking system that prevents data contamination, ensures fairness, and maintains evaluation integrity through technical and procedural safeguards.

Conclusion: The current laissez-faire approach to AI evaluation is unsustainable. A paradigm shift toward community-governed, proctored evaluation frameworks like PeerBench is essential for trustworthy AI assessment, enabling genuine progress measurement and restoring public confidence in AI development.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

*Bohan Lin,Kuo Yang,Yingchuan Lai,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Guibin Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Miao Yu,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk is a lightweight clarification module that improves multi-agent LLM systems by detecting and addressing edge-level error propagation through targeted questioning, achieving better accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM systems often underperform single-agent baselines due to error cascades where minor inaccuracies in message handoffs propagate across the entire chain, degrading overall performance.

Method: AgentAsk uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) distills edge-level judgments from failure traces into a compact policy, (2) supervises the policy to determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (3) optimizes online with E-GRPO reinforcement learning to balance accuracy, latency, and cost.

Result: Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent implementations while keeping overhead minimal (latency and extra cost <5%), approaching strong evaluator performance.

Conclusion: AgentAsk provides a scalable pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems through principled error taxonomy and practical link-local intervention, offering architecture-agnostic integration with existing orchestration.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: A traceable and accountable Planner-Executor-Critic pipeline using LLMs improves accuracy by preventing error propagation through structured handoffs and clear role assignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential multi-agent LLM systems are hard to trust due to silent error propagation between stages, requiring traceable and accountable pipelines.

Method: Evaluated eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs in a Planner-Executor-Critic pipeline on three benchmarks, analyzing error origins, propagation, and fixes.

Result: Structured handoffs improve accuracy and prevent failures; models show role-specific strengths; heterogeneous pipelines are often most efficient for accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: Generative AI can enhance mental health training rather than just creating therapist chatbots, offering lower-risk, high-impact applications for scaling mental health service provision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current focus on AI in mental health is primarily on therapist chatbots, but there's concern about risks. The paper argues for shifting investment to using generative AI for training mental health service providers as a safer alternative.

Method: Presents a real-world case study where generative AI was used to improve training of veterans to support each other's mental health, demonstrating practical application of AI-enhanced training methods.

Result: Generative AI successfully improved the training process for mental health service provision, showing potential for scaling training programs while maintaining quality and safety.

Conclusion: Investment should prioritize using generative AI to support and scale training of mental health service providers rather than focusing primarily on therapist chatbots, as this approach offers significant benefits with lower risks.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

### [121] [Test-Time Matching: Unlocking Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07632)
*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that standard evaluation metrics underestimate AI models' compositional reasoning capabilities. By introducing group matching scores and test-time matching (TTM), the authors reveal hidden model capabilities and achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies suggest frontier AI models struggle with compositional reasoning, performing poorly on established benchmarks. The authors suspect current evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capabilities.

Method: Introduces group matching score to better exploit group structure, and proposes Test-Time Matching (TTM) - an iterative self-improving algorithm that bootstraps model performance without external supervision.

Result: SigLIP-B16 surpasses all previous results and GPT-4.1, achieving first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground. TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing new state-of-the-art with relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: TTM consistently improves model performance across 16 dataset variants, advancing the frontier of compositional reasoning by revealing and leveraging hidden model capabilities that standard metrics fail to capture.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

### [122] [Safely Exploring Novel Actions in Recommender Systems via Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07635)
*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) and a novel framework for safely exploring novel actions in recommender systems while guaranteeing safety through multiple deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel items are frequently added to recommender systems, but existing Off-Policy Learning methods can be unsafe when dealing with novel actions. There's a need to explore novel actions while ensuring safety.

Method: Developed Safe OPG based on high confidence off-policy evaluation, and proposed Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration framework that uses safety margin and gradually relaxes safety regularization during multiple deployments.

Result: Safe OPG almost always satisfies safety requirements while existing methods violate them greatly, though it tends to be too conservative. The proposed framework enables exploration while guaranteeing safety.

Conclusion: The framework successfully overcomes the tradeoff between safety guarantees and novel action exploration, enabling safe implementation of recommender systems with novel item exploration.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulation framework evaluates generative agents' safety, trust, and social dynamics in multimodal environments, revealing limitations in aligning local plan revisions with global safety and a tendency to overtrust misleading visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether generative agents can be trusted in multimodal environments, as their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited despite advances in large language and vision-language models.

Method: A reproducible simulation framework with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and SocialMetrics (behavioral and structural metrics) to evaluate agents along safety improvement, unsafe activity detection, and social dynamics dimensions.

Result: Agents achieved only 55% success in correcting unsafe plans, with unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75%, 55%, and 58% for Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL respectively. 45% of unsafe actions were accepted with misleading visuals, showing overtrust of images.

Conclusion: Current architectures have critical limitations in multimodal safety, particularly in aligning local revisions with global safety and resisting misleading visuals, providing a platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

### [124] [Control Synthesis of Cyber-Physical Systems for Real-Time Specifications through Causation-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07715)
*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an online reward generation method for reinforcement learning using signal temporal logic (STL) causation monitoring to provide instantaneous rewards that reflect local state dynamics, overcoming sparse global reward issues in STL-guided RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STL-guided RL methods use sparse global rewards that don't accumulate local changes accurately, leading to non-convergence and unstable training in cyber-physical systems requiring real-time control synthesis.

Method: Uses online causation monitoring of STL specifications at each control step to compute quantitative distance toward satisfaction/violation, providing instantaneous rewards. Includes smooth approximation of causation semantics for differentiability in deep-RL.

Result: Experimental evaluation in Gym environment shows the method outperforms existing STL-guided RL approaches, providing more robust and efficient reward generation for deep-RL in continuously controlled benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed STL-guided RL with online causation semantics offers a superior framework for real-time control synthesis in cyber-physical systems by providing instantaneous, differentiable rewards that improve training stability and convergence.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

*Ruiling Xu,Yifan Zhang,Qingyun Wang,Carl Edwards,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces oMeBench, the first large-scale expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning, and oMeS evaluation framework, showing current LLMs struggle with consistent multi-step chemical reasoning but can be improved by 50% with specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs possess genuine chemical reasoning capabilities for organic reaction mechanisms, including generating valid intermediates, maintaining chemical consistency, and following coherent multi-step pathways.

Method: Created oMeBench with over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps and proposed oMeS evaluation framework combining step-level logic and chemical similarity. Analyzed state-of-the-art LLMs and tested prompting strategies and fine-tuning.

Result: Current LLMs show promising chemical intuition but struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Fine-tuning a specialist model on the proposed dataset increased performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model.

Conclusion: oMeBench provides a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning, demonstrating that specialized training significantly improves LLM performance in organic mechanism understanding.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

### [126] [SurveyG: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework with Hierarchical Citation Graph for Automated Survey Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07733)
*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG is an LLM-based agent framework that uses hierarchical citation graphs to generate more structured and comprehensive survey papers by capturing research evolution through three layers (Foundation, Development, Frontier) and employing multi-agent validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based survey generation methods overlook structural relationships among papers, resulting in surveys lacking coherent taxonomy and deeper contextual understanding of research progress.

Method: Integrates hierarchical citation graph with three layers (Foundation, Development, Frontier) that capture citation dependencies and semantic relatedness. Uses horizontal search within layers and vertical traversal across layers to produce multi-level summaries, followed by multi-agent validation for consistency and accuracy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks in experiments with human experts and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured according to the field's knowledge taxonomy.

Conclusion: SurveyG successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by embedding structural and contextual knowledge into survey generation, resulting in higher quality surveys with improved organization and coverage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA is an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability in medical applications through formally verifiable reasoning, breaking down tasks into atomic steps and auditing the reasoning chain, with a bootstrapping mode that stores validated chains as theorems for efficient RAG-based problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in medicine but are prone to factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in high-stakes medical applications where reliability is critical.

Method: MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps and automatically audits the reasoning chain for logical coherence and evidence traceability. It features a bootstrapping mode that stores validated reasoning chains as theorems, enabling efficient RAG-based problem solving.

Result: MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with false positive rate below 1% across four healthcare administration domains, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. The RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures.

Conclusion: MMIA's verifiable reasoning framework represents a significant step toward creating trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology viable for critical applications in medicine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAIL, a novel framework that reframes Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) as a generative graph restoration problem using LLMs, addressing the challenge of domain adaptation without access to source-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation methods rely on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or security concerns. This limitation drives the need for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation that can transfer knowledge without accessing source examples.

Method: Proposes GRAIL framework that: 1) Compresses node representations into compact latent features and uses graph diffusion for restoration modeling, 2) Encodes restored features into discrete tokens via quantization, 3) Fine-tunes LLM as generative restorer to transform noisy target graphs into native ones, 4) Uses reinforcement learning with alignment and confidence rewards to improve restoration quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across various datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses TT-GDA by reframing it as a generative graph restoration problem using LLMs, achieving effective domain adaptation without requiring access to source-domain data.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: LLMs suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks because existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual decomposition.

Method: Introduces ACONIC framework that models tasks as constraint problems and leverages formal complexity measures to guide systematic decomposition.

Result: On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), decomposition following complexity measures enables agents to perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point improvement).

Conclusion: Systematic decomposition guided by formal complexity measures significantly enhances LLM reliability and performance on complex tasks compared to heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual

that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCPO introduces external reference answers to overcome GRPO's limitation of being constrained by the model's own responses, enabling learning from all samples and improving reasoning generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in GRPO where models can't learn from samples that are entirely correct or incorrect due to being bounded by their own rollout responses.

Method: Uses external standard reference answers to provide correct responses when the model fails, guiding model updates and enabling emulation of reference problem-solving strategies.

Result: Achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets with substantial improvements over baseline models.

Conclusion: GCPO effectively improves training efficiency and reasoning generalization by incorporating external reference knowledge.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHADOW is a reinforcement learning framework that enables pursuer agents to strategically balance communication for information gathering with the risk of exposure in adversarial pursuit-evasion scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental trade-off in adversarial environments where acquiring information (through communication) enhances situational awareness but simultaneously exposes agents to threats by revealing their location.

Method: Proposed SHADOW framework using multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction in the PEEC game formulation.

Result: SHADOW pursuers achieved higher success rates than six competitive baselines, with ablation studies confirming that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for effective decision-making.

Conclusion: The learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents, demonstrating the effectiveness of strategic communication balancing in adversarial pursuit-evasion scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav is a hierarchical LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation that integrates global traffic allocation with local navigation agents, using cooperative reasoning optimization to improve city-scale travel efficiency and reduce congestion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks and fail to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic in multi-vehicle dynamic navigation scenarios.

Method: CityNav uses a hierarchical framework with a global traffic allocation agent that coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, and local navigation agents that generate adaptive routes. It employs cooperative reasoning optimization with a dual-reward structure (individual rewards for per-vehicle efficiency and shared rewards for network-wide coordination).

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) show CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Motivation: There is a critical gap in evaluating MLLMs for specialized domains like finance, lacking datasets with professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced reasoning complexity.

Method: Created FinMR dataset with over 3,200 meticulously curated and expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics, integrating mathematical reasoning, financial knowledge, and visual interpretation across multiple image types.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant performance disparities between leading MLLMs and professional financial analysts, identifying key areas for improvement including precise image analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper contextual financial understanding.

Conclusion: FinMR establishes itself as an essential benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning toward professional analyst-level competence, providing richly varied visual content and thorough explanatory annotations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced

expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augur is a fully LLM-driven time series forecasting framework that uses causal reasoning to discover directed causal associations among covariates through a two-stage teacher-student architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting approaches have limitations including marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability.

Method: A two-stage teacher-student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers directed causal graphs using heuristic search and pairwise causality testing, then a lightweight student agent refines the graph and fine-tunes on high-confidence causal associations encoded as rich textual prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25 baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Augur improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepResearch-ReportEval is a new evaluation framework that assesses DeepResearch AI systems through their research report outputs, measuring quality, redundancy, and factuality using LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate holistic performance of DeepResearch systems, which must synthesize diverse sources and generate insights in open-ended research scenarios that resist simple verification.

Method: Systematically measures three dimensions (quality, redundancy, factuality) using LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with strong expert concordance, and provides a benchmark of 100 curated queries across 12 real-world categories.

Result: Evaluation of four leading commercial systems revealed distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights for DeepResearch evolution.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval addresses the critical evaluation gap for DeepResearch systems as they evolve from information assistants toward intelligent research partners.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

### [136] [Towards Meaningful Transparency in Civic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889)
*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'meaningful transparency' for civic AI systems, addressing limitations of current technical transparency approaches by focusing on public understanding and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI transparency practices focus on technical representations that are hard for publics to understand, don't connect to action, and ignore socio-material contexts, reducing citizen and civic worker agency.

Method: Builds on human-centric AI transparency approaches combined with socio-technical systems view to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems.

Result: Developed the concept of meaningful transparency that allows publics to engage with AI systems affecting their lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Conclusion: Meaningful transparency is needed for civic AI systems to enable public engagement and connect understanding with actionable insights, moving beyond purely technical transparency approaches.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

### [137] [Profit Mirage: Revisiting Information Leakage in LLM-based Financial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07920)
*Xiangyu Li,Yawen Zeng,Xiaofen Xing,Jin Xu,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "profit mirage" in LLM-based financial agents where back-tested returns disappear due to information leakage, introduces FinLake-Bench for robust evaluation, and proposes FactFin framework using counterfactual perturbations to improve causal learning and out-of-sample performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based financial agents show impressive back-tested returns but suffer from "profit mirage" where performance evaporates after the model's knowledge window ends due to inherent information leakage in LLMs, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces FactFin framework with four components: Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. The framework applies counterfactual perturbations to force agents to learn causal drivers rather than memorized outcomes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FactFin surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization and delivers superior risk-adjusted performance, effectively addressing the information leakage problem.

Conclusion: The proposed FactFin framework successfully mitigates information leakage in LLM-based financial agents by promoting causal learning through counterfactual perturbations, enabling more robust and generalizable trading performance beyond the training period.

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

### [138] [Enabling Personalized Long-term Interactions in LLM-based Agents through Persistent Memory and User Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07925)
*Rebecca Westhäußer,Wolfgang Minker,Sebatian Zepf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for personalized LLM-based agents that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to enable adaptive, long-term interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack mechanisms to combine contextual information with user-specific data for personalized interactions, and existing personalization approaches remain largely conceptual without technical implementation focus.

Method: The framework builds on a unified definition of personalization and combines established agentic AI patterns (multi-agent collaboration, multi-source retrieval) with persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles.

Result: Evaluation on three public datasets using metrics like retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and BertScore, plus a five-day pilot user study showing initial positive feedback on perceived personalization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents, providing early indications to guide future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

*Pengkun Jiao,Yiming Jin,Jianhui Yang,Chenhe Dong,Zerui Huang,Shaowei Yao,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaoSR-SHE is a reinforcement learning framework for e-commerce search relevance that uses stepwise rewards and hybrid verification to improve reasoning quality and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods (SFT, DPO, RLVR) have limitations: poor generalization on long-tail queries, lack of stepwise supervision, and sparse feedback that undermines logical consistency in complex inference scenarios.

Method: Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning (TaoSR-SHE) with Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO) using step-level rewards from generative reward models and human-annotated verifiers, plus diversified data filtering and multi-stage curriculum learning.

Result: Outperforms SFT, DPO, GRPO and other baselines on real-world search benchmarks, improving both reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings.

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE enhances interpretability and robustness for e-commerce search relevance systems while achieving superior performance through stepwise reinforcement learning with hybrid verification.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: VoiceAgentBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 5,500+ synthetic spoken queries to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic agentic scenarios, covering multilingual capabilities, cultural context, and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities like transcription or QA, lacking systematic evaluation of agentic scenarios with multilingual/cultural understanding and adversarial robustness.

Method: Created VoiceAgentBench with synthetic spoken queries including Indian context dialogues, supporting English, Hindi and 5 other Indian languages. Used novel sampling algorithm for speaker variability via TTS voice conversion based on speaker embeddings.

Result: Experiments revealed significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic language generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench successfully identifies substantial limitations in current SpeechLMs, particularly in multilingual agentic scenarios and adversarial settings, highlighting the need for improved models.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent is a context-aware multi-agent framework that enables human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation by addressing information dilemmas through dynamic information management and user collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents prioritize autonomous operation but fail to handle information dilemmas (ambiguous, dynamic, conflicting tasks), leading to outcomes misaligned with user preferences. There's a need for systems that actively engage users during task execution.

Method: ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: information-managing agent for slot-based information management and user interaction, decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning, and reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency validation.

Result: ReInAgent achieves 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, effectively resolving information dilemmas and producing outcomes more closely aligned with genuine user preferences.

Conclusion: The framework enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex, real-world scenarios through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained user-agent collaboration, overcoming limitations of approaches relying on clear and static task assumptions.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models represent numeric values as non-continuous embeddings with significant noise, despite high reconstruction fidelity, with performance degrading as decimal precision increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models actually represent continuous numeric values as continuous in their embedding spaces, building on previous research that showed reconstruction is possible but didn't evaluate continuity.

Method: Used expected properties of embedding space including linear reconstruction and principal component analysis on models from OpenAI, Google Gemini and Voyage AI, testing with increasing decimal precision.

Result: While numeric reconstruction achieved high fidelity (R² ≥ 0.95), principal components explained only minor variation, indicating many embedding components are orthogonal to numeric input space. Both linear reconstruction and explained variance degraded with increasing decimal precision.

Conclusion: Language models represent numeric spaces as non-continuous with significant noise, which has implications for applications requiring high numerical precision, large magnitudes, or mixed-sign values.

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [144] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR is a reward mechanism that uses phase-dependent entropy to control reasoning length in Large Reasoning Models, reducing verbose explanations while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate excessively long chain-of-thought explanations with redundant reasoning steps, which increases inference costs and reduces usability. There's a need to control response length without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: PEAR (Phase Entropy Aware Reward) incorporates phase-dependent entropy into reward design, penalizing excessive entropy during the thinking phase while allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase. This enables adaptive length control without explicit targets or truncation.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmarks show PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy across model scales. It also demonstrates strong out-of-distribution robustness beyond the training distribution.

Conclusion: Phase-dependent entropy serves as an effective control mechanism for balancing reasoning conciseness and performance, enabling models to generate more efficient reasoning traces without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

### [145] [AILoRA: Function-Aware Asymmetric Initialization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08034)
*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA is a parameter-efficient finetuning method that uses function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors to address LoRA's limitations in performance and convergence speed by differently initializing Q and V projection matrices based on their distinct functional roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA faces challenges with suboptimal performance and slow convergence despite being widely adopted. The authors observed that Q and V projection matrices in self-attention have distinct parameter characteristics due to their functional differences, suggesting an opportunity for improvement through asymmetric treatment.

Method: AILoRA performs function-aware initialization: injects principal components of W^Q to retain task-adaptive capacity, and minor components of W^V to preserve generalizable feature representations. This asymmetric strategy better captures the specialized roles of attention parameters.

Result: The method enhances both finetuning performance and convergence efficiency by leveraging the distinct characteristics of Q and V matrices - W^Q is sensitive to task variations while W^V remains stable across tasks.

Conclusion: AILoRA successfully addresses LoRA's limitations through function-aware asymmetric initialization, demonstrating that considering the distinct functional roles of attention projection matrices can significantly improve parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim is an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic 3D driving scenarios with interactive vehicle behaviors, addressing the trade-off between command accuracy and realism in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scenario generation methods struggle to balance command adherence with realism, often limiting scenarios to 2D or non-interactive simulations, creating a need for more realistic and interactive 3D scenario generation.

Method: Uses LLMs to convert natural language into interactive 3D scenarios with dynamic vehicle interactions, incorporating a feedback calibration module to refine generation precision and better align with user intent.

Result: Generates scenarios with varying criticality aligned with descriptions (ACT: 0.072s dangerous vs. 3.532s safe; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and reduces crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% through refinement.

Conclusion: LinguaSim successfully bridges natural language and closed-loop interactive simulations, enabling high-fidelity scenario generation for enhanced autonomous vehicle safety testing and training.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCCS, a conformal selection method that extends FDR control to multi-condition scenarios (conjunctive/disjunctive) with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal selection methods only handle single-threshold scenarios (y > c) but practical applications need multi-condition selection like conjunctive/disjunctive conditions in drug discovery, precision medicine, and LLM alignment.

Method: Proposes MCCS algorithm with novel nonconformity score for conjunctive conditions and global BH procedure for disjunctive conditions, establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Extensive experiments show MCCS outperforms baselines, generalizes across diverse condition combinations, works with different real-world modalities, and scales to multi-task settings.

Conclusion: MCCS enables rigorous FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments, addressing a critical gap in conformal selection methods for practical applications.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual is an LLM-based agent framework that automates discovery of interpretable features for review quality assessment, transforming tacit knowledge into explicit features through iterative hypothesis generation and tool implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for ranking online reviews are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while deep learning approaches lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality.

Method: AutoQual mimics human research process by iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in persistent memory.

Result: Deployed on a large-scale platform with billion-level user base, A/B testing showed 0.79% increase in average reviews viewed per user and 0.27% increase in conversion rate of review readers.

Conclusion: AutoQual provides an effective general framework for transforming tacit knowledge into explicit, computable features, demonstrating practical value in real-world e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [149] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for provably fair AI using ontology engineering and optimal transport to systematically remove sensitive information and proxies, ensuring complete fairness with mathematical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias mitigation methods have limitations in addressing proxy variables that reveal sensitive attributes, requiring a mathematically grounded approach to ensure true independence rather than just decorrelation.

Method: Uses OWL 2 QL ontology engineering to define sensitive attributes and infer proxies through logical reasoning, constructs sigma algebra G to capture biased patterns, then applies Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport to generate fair representations independent of G while minimizing L2 distance.

Result: Achieves complete fairness by ensuring true independence from sensitive attributes and proxies, as demonstrated in tasks like loan approval where proxies such as ZIP code reveal race.

Conclusion: Provides a certifiable and mathematically grounded method for trustworthy AI that guarantees provable fairness through systematic removal of sensitive information and its proxies.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: This study examines how manipulable language models' risk aversion behaviors are, finding they only partially align with human risk preferences across various economic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LMs are increasingly used in decision support systems, understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for responsible AI deployment to prevent nudging users toward risky decisions or embedding hidden biases.

Method: Investigated manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs by examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, focusing on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and risk aversion manipulability.

Result: LMs like DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite show some alignment with human behaviors but exhibit notable discrepancies, highlighting the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability.

Conclusion: The findings suggest directions for refining AI design to better align human and AI risk preferences, enhance ethical decision-making, and improve AI effectiveness in risk management contexts through more accurate replication of human risk preferences.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

*Jinling Gan,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR is a temporal decoupling framework that resolves the latency-quality tradeoff in dialogue systems through asynchronous knowledge orchestration, achieving 95.3% latency reduction while maintaining response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental latency-quality tradeoff in open-domain dialogue systems where comprehensive knowledge access causes prohibitive response delays, and current solutions are inadequate - lightweight models lack reasoning depth while tool-augmented agents block interaction during retrieval.

Method: PMFR employs three coordinated components: Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, Lightweight Response Generator for immediate interaction, and Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement, with intelligent triggering mechanisms.

Result: Evaluation on TopiOCQA shows PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s → 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Conclusion: PMFR fundamentally resolves the latency-quality contradiction through asynchronous knowledge orchestration, maintaining continuous conversational flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage.

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-HORIZON is a method and benchmark for evaluating and enhancing long-horizon reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) through query composition, revealing current models' limitations in multi-step reasoning and enabling improved training via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-horizon tasks and fail to evaluate models' ability to handle complex, long-horizon scenarios, creating an incomplete assessment of Large Reasoning Models' capabilities.

Method: Proposed R-HORIZON method using query composition to stimulate long-horizon reasoning, constructed a benchmark with complex multi-step reasoning tasks, and used it for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR) training.

Result: Advanced LRMs show significant performance degradation on long-horizon tasks, exhibiting limited effective reasoning length and poor thinking budget allocation. RLVR training with R-HORIZON data improved multi-horizon reasoning performance and boosted accuracy on standard tasks by 7.5 on AIME2024.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON provides a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for both evaluating and enhancing the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a transparent measurement framework that evaluates AI systems across four pillars of pluralistic governance to address concentration of AI development power and ensure diverse stakeholder participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI development and governance are concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Current capability benchmarks are common but public, auditable measures of pluralistic governance are rare.

Method: AIPI evaluates producers and system families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and diversity, transparency, and accountability. It codes verifiable practices from public artifacts and independent evaluations, handling 'Unknown' evidence to report both lower-bound and known-only scores with coverage. The method includes a reproducible pipeline with structured web analysis, repository analysis, external assessments, and expert interviews.

Result: The paper presents pilot provider results and situates AIPI relative to adjacent transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index demonstrates reliability through inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: The AI Pluralism Index aims to steer incentives toward pluralistic practice and equip policymakers, procurers, and the public with comparable evidence for evaluating AI governance and ensuring diverse stakeholder participation in AI development.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM) - a novel pairwise comparison framework that requires only m-1 comparisons (vs traditional m(m-1)/2) to achieve complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrices, reducing cognitive load and ensuring consistency by design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pairwise comparison methods like Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's Multiplicative Preference Relations suffer from high cognitive load (m(m-1)/2 comparisons), inconsistency risks, and computational complexity in deriving consistent value scales.

Method: TTM consists of three phases: (i) elicitation using reduced targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of global value scale. It reduces preference modeling dimensionality from m(m-1)/2 to m parameters and is compatible with Deck of Cards method.

Result: The method ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and maintains compatibility with classical methods while handling interval and ratio scales. A web-based tool demonstrates practical applicability.

Conclusion: TTM overcomes limitations of traditional pairwise comparison methods by providing a more efficient, consistent, and cognitively manageable framework for multi-criteria decision-making with proven practical applicability.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

*Matteo Gregorini,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DODO is an algorithm that enables AI agents to autonomously learn causal structures through interventions, outperforming observational methods in most scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI relies on correlations rather than causal understanding. Enabling causality awareness can improve AI performance by providing deeper insights into environmental mechanisms.

Method: An agent interacts with a world governed by a hidden causal DAG, performing interventions and using causal inference techniques to analyze statistical significance of observed changes.

Result: DODO shows better performance than observational approaches in all but the most limited resource conditions, often reconstructing causal graphs with zero errors and outperforming the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points in challenging configurations.

Conclusion: The DODO algorithm successfully enables autonomous causal structure learning through interventions, demonstrating superior performance over correlation-based approaches.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

*Yunlong Deng,Boyang Sun,Yan Li,Lingjing Kong,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang,Guangyi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SR², a causal framework that treats reasoning as selection operations using latent logical concepts, improving reasoning accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs fail to perform reasoning reliably despite extensive training. The paper aims to understand reasoning tasks from a causal perspective in latent space to address their challenges.

Method: Introduces SR² framework with three modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. It incorporates estimated latent variables as feedback into selection mechanisms.

Result: Achieves over 10% improvement in performance with 8× fewer parameters on Sudoku and Maze tasks compared to recent advances.

Conclusion: The causal formulation of reasoning as selection operations with dense latent dependencies provides an effective approach for improving reasoning capabilities in machine learning models.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoTri is a multi-step backdoor attack for LLM-based agents that uses an ordered sequence of triggers to achieve long-horizon control, achieving near-perfect attack success while paradoxically improving agent performance on benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security concerns about LLM-based agents by revealing their vulnerabilities to sophisticated backdoor attacks that can maintain long-term control.

Method: Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri) uses an ordered sequence of triggers where initial triggers are planted and subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, enabling multi-step manipulation that diverts agents from intended tasks.

Result: CoTri achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) with near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Paradoxically, it enhances agent performance on benign tasks and improves robustness against environmental distractions.

Conclusion: CoTri demonstrates stable multi-step control within agents while improving their inherent robustness, making attacks more stealthy and highlighting significant safety risks for deployed LLM-based agents.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent systems across three core dimensions: Interoperability, Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing.

Method: Three-layer protocol design: HAI for standardized event-driven human-agent interaction, UAP for unified service discovery and protocol conversion in infrastructure, and MEK for standardized memory-extraction-knowledge cognitive chain.

Result: A comprehensive protocol framework that enables real-time performance, reliability, synergy in interactions, seamless interconnection of heterogeneous agents, and collective intelligence through shareable knowledge.

Conclusion: Co-TAP provides a solid engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building next-generation efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Motivation: To accelerate optimization of related problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem instances, particularly leveraging scale equivariance for neural network optimization.

Method: Using Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) that operate directly in weight space to enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models.

Result: Empirical demonstration of effectiveness and theoretical proof that gauge freedom from scaling symmetries is smaller in CNNs than MLPs, explaining performance differences between architectures.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware metanetworks show strong potential for efficient and generalizable neural network optimization, with ScaleGMNs providing a powerful approach for amortized optimization.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reflections in LLMs are mostly confirmatory and rarely change initial answers. Training with more reflections improves first-answer correctness rather than error correction. A question-aware early-stopping method reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual contribution of reflections in LLM reasoning and determine if they meaningfully improve performance or are just token-inefficient confirmatory steps.

Method: Systematic analysis of 8 reasoning models on 5 math datasets, construction of SFT datasets with varying reflection steps, and development of question-aware early-stopping that truncates reflections after candidate answers appear.

Result: Reflections are predominantly confirmatory (rarely change initial answers). Training with more reflections enhances first-answer correctness rather than error correction ability. Early-stopping reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% with only 2.9% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Reflections in current LLMs are largely inefficient confirmatory steps. Question-aware early-stopping can significantly improve token efficiency while maintaining performance, suggesting more targeted approaches are needed for effective reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR models outperform base models at small sampling budgets but underperform at large k values, which may misrepresent reasoning boundaries. The paper proposes Cover@tau as a better metric that captures reasoning under reliability thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misleading interpretation of Pass@k at large sampling budgets, which reflects random guessing rather than genuine reasoning capabilities, especially in tasks with discrete answer spaces.

Method: Proposes Cover@tau metric that measures the fraction of problems a model can solve where at least a tau proportion of completions are correct, capturing reasoning under explicit reliability thresholds.

Result: Evaluation shows that relative rankings of RLVR algorithms change significantly when using Cover@tau compared to Pass@1, providing a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Conclusion: Cover@tau offers a more reliable way to assess reasoning boundaries by penalizing models that rely on random guessing, revealing different performance rankings than traditional Pass@k metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR) method uses LLMs to simulate synthetic consumers by mapping textual responses to Likert distributions via embedding similarity, achieving 90% human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consumer research suffers from panel biases and limited scale, while direct LLM numerical ratings produce unrealistic distributions.

Method: SSR elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps them to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.

Result: On 57 product surveys (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% human test-retest reliability with KS similarity > 0.85, plus rich qualitative feedback.

Conclusion: SSR enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent is a unified agentic RAG framework that uses RL-trained search agents for adaptive retrieval, addressing limitations in traditional RAG and improving generalization in LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with complex query understanding, and RL-trained search agents face generalization and deployment challenges despite their promise.

Method: Proposes QAgent framework with modular search agents trained with RL for multi-step decision processes to optimize query understanding and retrieval quality.

Result: Experiments show QAgent excels at QA tasks and serves as an effective plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: QAgent enhances retrieval-augmented generation by focusing on effective retrieval through RL-trained agents, improving generalization and practical deployment in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a simple method to detect hallucinations in LLMs by measuring the effective rank of hidden states from multiple outputs and layers, providing interpretable insights without extra modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting hallucinations in LLMs is crucial for trustworthy deployment, and existing uncertainty-driven frameworks need improvement to better understand internal reasoning processes.

Method: Quantifies uncertainty by measuring effective rank of hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers, using spectral analysis of representations without requiring extra knowledge or modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a new paradigm for hallucination detection that combines theoretical elegance with practical efficiency, demonstrating the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally and externally.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: To train vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data by rethinking how models integrate multimodal information within the constraints of the BabyLM Challenge 2025.

Method: Proposed a lightweight decoder-based architecture with token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion, feature modulation and channel attention to maximize limited visual information utility, and auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding.

Result: Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. The dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without supervision, favoring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is established as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints, though limitations include information bottleneck from global image embeddings and training instability from dataset split.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the

*Shangheng Du,Xiangchao Yan,Dengyang Jiang,Jiakang Yuan,Yusong Hu,Xin Li,Liang He,Bo Zhang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMLGen is an LLM-based coding agent that combines domain knowledge and Monte Carlo Graph Search to improve performance in Machine Learning Engineering tasks like AutoML and competitions, achieving state-of-the-art results with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with MLE tasks due to lack of domain priors and limitations of existing search methods that restrict knowledge transfer and self-evolution capabilities.

Method: Integrates domain knowledge base with Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) that enables dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion, combined with fine-grained operator sets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Bench with improved average medal rate and valid submission rate under half the standard runtime (12-hour budget).

Conclusion: AutoMLGen effectively addresses LLM limitations in MLE scenarios through knowledge integration and advanced graph search, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaRT teaches LLMs when to stop information gathering by fine-tuning with counterfactual trajectory pairs and verbal reasoning explanations, improving efficiency and success rates in medical diagnosis and math problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks require strategic information gathering over multiple rounds, but current models struggle to know when to stop gathering information and make decisions, leading to overthinking or getting derailed.

Method: CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories (one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version where it's not) and trains the model to explain the rationale for termination decisions via verbal reasoning.

Result: In interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving domains, CaRT improves both the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CaRT effectively teaches LLMs when to terminate information gathering through counterfactual training and verbal reasoning, leading to more efficient and successful task performance.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep research requires navigating diverse knowledge spaces and reasoning over complex multi-step dependencies, which poses challenges for agentic systems.

Method: Proposes FlowSearch, a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves dynamic structured knowledge flows to drive subtask execution and reasoning, enabling parallel exploration and real-time adjustments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on general and scientific benchmarks including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios.

Conclusion: FlowSearch shows potential to advance scientific discovery through its dynamic knowledge flow approach to complex research tasks.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "early experience" - interaction data generated by agents' own actions where future states serve as supervision, as a bridge between imitation learning and reinforcement learning for language agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data which is hard to scale and generalizes poorly, while reinforcement learning faces challenges in environments without verifiable rewards or requiring inefficient long-horizon rollouts.

Method: Two strategies using early experience: (1) Implicit world modeling using collected states to ground policy in environment dynamics, and (2) Self-reflection where agents learn from suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Evaluation across eight diverse environments and multiple model families shows consistent improvements in effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization. In environments with verifiable rewards, early experience provides strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Early experience offers a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents, enabling agents to learn and improve through their own experience while overcoming limitations of current training approaches.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: This paper studies how to teach large multimodal models new skills without forgetting prior abilities, identifying that apparent forgetting can partly recover later and proposing two simple tuning methods that update only specific layers to maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in large multimodal models when sequentially fine-tuning them on new skills, while preserving their existing capabilities.

Method: Sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. Identified two tuning recipes: (1) updating only self-attention projection layers, (2) updating only MLP Gate&Up while freezing Down projection.

Result: Observed that apparent forgetting on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. The proposed tuning methods deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance across models and tasks.

Conclusion: Simple layer-specific tuning strategies can effectively teach new skills to large multimodal models while limiting performance drift and preserving prior abilities.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLEET is a hybrid framework that combines LLM-based task decomposition with formal optimization to coordinate heterogeneous robot teams from natural language instructions, improving success rates over language-only planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language planning for robot teams faces challenges with long-horizon coordination and hallucination, while formal methods require closed-world models. There's a need for a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both.

Method: Uses an LLM front-end to generate task graphs with durations/precedence and robot-task fitness matrices, then a formal back-end solves makespan-minimization problems while robots execute with closed-loop control.

Result: FLEET improves success rates over state-of-the-art generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks, with MILP improving temporal structure and LLM-derived fitness being crucial for capability-coupled tasks.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining LLM-based decomposition with formal optimization delivers the highest overall performance for coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from natural language instructions.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

TL;DR: A lightweight encoder-decoder GRU model for vehicle state prediction using only onboard measurements and driver controls, achieving under 2.6% error in extreme conditions with good noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle dynamics modeling is challenging without detailed structural information, especially for autonomous driving applications built on existing vehicles where designers lack full system knowledge.

Method: Encoder-decoder architecture using Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers to correlate future vehicle states with past states and driver control actions, entirely data-driven without physical constraints.

Result: Maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic conditions, good robustness to noisy input data across relevant frequencies, and physically consistent output signals for accelerations, yaw rate, and velocity.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven GRU model effectively predicts vehicle states without requiring detailed structural information, demonstrating high accuracy, noise robustness, and physical consistency in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analytical IK solvers are limited to simple systems, while numerical optimization approaches suffer from high computational costs and local minima convergence issues. Recent GPU-based methods combining sampling and optimization show promise but need improvement in accuracy and speed.

Method: A hybrid approach using GPU acceleration with two main components: 1) orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent for initialization, and 2) Jacobian-based polishing routine. This combines sampling and optimization techniques.

Result: The solver achieves significant improvements in both convergence speed and accuracy, consistently finding solutions along the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier with order-of-magnitude gains. It also produces high-quality samples with the lowest maximum mean discrepancy.

Conclusion: HJCD-IK represents an advancement in IK solving by effectively combining sampling and optimization on GPUs, offering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while being released as open-source for community benefit.

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AVO introduces a learned value function to bridge separately optimized sub-tasks in dexterous manipulation, improving performance while reducing computational costs by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches decompose dexterous manipulation tasks into independent sub-tasks for each contact mode, which limits performance and is computationally expensive due to lack of information about future sub-tasks.

Method: Proposes Amortized Value Optimization (AVO) that incorporates a learned value function into trajectory optimization cost, using value function gradients to guide the optimizer toward states that minimize future sub-task costs.

Result: Validated on screwdriver grasping and turning task in simulation and real world, showing improved performance with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization without value function.

Conclusion: AVO effectively bridges separately optimized sub-tasks in dexterous manipulation and accelerates optimization by reducing online computation needs.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes IPIM - primitive computations that enable sampling-based inspection planners to use neural SDFs directly, reducing memory usage by up to 70x while maintaining trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inspection planners require huge memory for large complex structures, and most primitive computations are designed for explicit models, forcing planners to use explicit models or frequent transformations between implicit and explicit representations.

Method: Developed Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM) - a set of primitive computations that allow sampling-based inspection planners to work entirely with neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) representation during planning.

Result: Evaluation on three scenarios (including a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces) shows that a basic sampling-based planner with IPIM generates inspection trajectories of similar quality to state-of-the-art planners while using up to 70x less memory.

Conclusion: IPIM enables efficient inspection planning for large complex structures by allowing direct use of neural SDFs, significantly reducing memory requirements without compromising trajectory quality.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate

*Alexander Du,Emre Adabag,Gabriel Bravo,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GATO is a GPU-accelerated batched trajectory optimization solver designed for real-time performance in moderate batch sizes (tens to low-hundreds of solves), achieving 18-21x speedup over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU-accelerated MPC approaches either parallelize single solves for real-time deadlines, scale to large batches at slower rates, or sacrifice model generality. There's a gap for applications requiring real-time batches of moderate size.

Method: Co-designed approach combining algorithm, software, and hardware using block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance.

Result: Demonstrated 18-21x speedup over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases, with improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior, validated on industrial manipulator hardware.

Conclusion: GATO effectively bridges the performance gap for moderate batch size MPC applications and is open-sourced to support reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

*Lucas Chen,Shrutheesh Raman Iyer,Zachary Kingston*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPaSM is a fully GPU-parallelized framework for sequential robot manipulation that achieves millisecond-level trajectory optimization through CUDA kernels and two-stage particle optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require real-time collision-free trajectories with geometric constraints, but existing methods suffer from computational limitations, CPU-GPU transfer overhead, and poor hardware utilization.

Method: A two-stage particle optimization strategy: first solves placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifts solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space, all compiled into optimized CUDA kernels without CPU coordination.

Result: Achieves solution times in milliseconds with 100% success rate, representing a 4000x speedup compared to existing approaches on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPaSM enables real-time sequential manipulation at large scales by fully leveraging GPU parallelism and joint optimization of object placements and robot trajectories.

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

*Raghav Mishra,Ian R. Manchester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EB-MBD introduces emerging barrier functions to Model-Based Diffusion to handle constraints efficiently, avoiding performance degradation and computational costs of projection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraints in Model-Based Diffusion cause catastrophic performance degradation due to sample inefficiency in Monte Carlo score approximation, even on simple systems.

Method: Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) uses progressively introduced barrier constraints, analyzes sampling liveliness to inform barrier parameter scheduling, and avoids expensive projections.

Result: EB-MBD achieves lower cost solutions than standard Model-Based Diffusion and requires orders of magnitude less computation time than projection-based methods in 2D collision avoidance and 3D underwater manipulator systems.

Conclusion: The emerging barrier approach effectively handles constraints in Model-Based Diffusion, improving solution quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

*Kasidit Muenprasitivej,Ye Zhao,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Probabilistically safe planning and control framework for bipedal robots on rough terrain using Gaussian Process regression and Conformal Prediction to handle terrain uncertainty, with contraction-based reachable tubes and flywheel torque control for stability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable bipedal robots to safely traverse rough terrain by addressing dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty, ensuring both safety and goal reachability.

Method: High-level MPC navigation with Gaussian Process regression for terrain estimation, Conformal Prediction for confidence intervals, contraction-based reachable tubes for terrain uncertainty, and flywheel torque control for LIPM angular momentum stabilization.

Result: The framework provides probabilistic safety guarantees and goal reachability, with demonstrated forward invariance of torque control law and exponential stabilization of CoM trajectories in physics-based simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables safe bipedal locomotion on uncertain rough terrain with formal safety guarantees and effective performance in simulation.

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a component-agnostic hallucination injection framework for testing autonomous vehicle safety by reframing perception failures as hallucinations that distort situational awareness, enabling analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles remain a major safety concern and cause many accidents. Existing fault injection studies are siloed and target single sensors or modules, making them difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments.

Method: Proposed a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. Conducted over 18,350 simulations where hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.

Result: The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the tested scenario.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component-agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even for novel MP architectures. It can reduce time-to-market and lay foundation for future research on fault tolerance and resilient AV design.

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrajSkill enables robots to learn manipulation skills directly from human videos by representing human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer without paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from human videos is challenging due to the embodiment gap between humans and robots. Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories to remove morphological variations while preserving dynamics. Condition on these trajectories with visual/textual inputs to synthesize robot videos and translate them into executable actions.

Result: On MetaWorld simulation: reduces FVD by 39.6% and KVD by 36.6% vs SOTA, improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7%. Real-robot kitchen tasks validate practical human-to-robot skill transfer.

Conclusion: TrajSkill effectively achieves cross-embodiment skill transfer from human videos to robots, demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses the limitation of current VLAs in reasoning about implicit human intentions. It uses a curriculum training paradigm with reasoning-intensive pretraining and an efficient inference mechanism that leverages compact reasoning outputs to guide action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art VLAs are pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios and lack reasoning-intensive pretraining, making them unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex real-world interactions.

Method: Proposes IntentionVLA with curriculum training: first uses carefully designed reasoning data combining intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, then finetunes using compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation under indirect instructions.

Result: Substantially outperforms baselines: 18% higher success rates than π₀ with direct instructions, 28% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40% success rate.

Conclusion: IntentionVLA represents a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction systems by effectively bridging the gap between perception, reasoning, and action in embodied AI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GM3 is a unified physics-based model for micro-mobility vehicles that captures tire slip, load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean across various wheel configurations, validated against real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models like Kinematic Bicycle Model miss critical dynamics like tire slip and load transfer, and no unified model exists for diverse micro-mobility vehicles with different wheel layouts.

Method: Proposed Generalized Micro-mobility Model (GM3) using tire brush representation supporting arbitrary wheel configurations, with simulation framework using RK4 integration and validation on Stanford Drone Dataset.

Result: GM3 successfully models dynamics across single/double track and multi-wheel platforms, capturing physics missed by traditional models.

Conclusion: GM3 provides a comprehensive physics-based framework for micro-mobility vehicle dynamics that outperforms existing models in capturing real-world physical phenomena.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

*Guowei Zou,Haitao Wang,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Weibing Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM1 is a flow matching framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent representation collapse in robotic manipulation policies, achieving 20-40x faster inference and 10-20% higher success rates than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based generative models offer efficient one-step action generation but suffer from representation collapse, where they fail to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in precise manipulation tasks.

Method: DM1 integrates multiple dispersive regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers into MeanFlow, encouraging diverse representations across training batches without adding extra network modules or specialized training procedures.

Result: Experiments show 20-40x faster inference (0.07s vs 2-3.5s), 10-20 percentage point improvement in success rates, with Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% baseline. Real-robot deployment validates effective sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: DM1 establishes a simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation, being the first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

Motivation: Underwater environments pose unique challenges for robotics, and developing multi-task autonomous underwater intelligence is difficult due to scarce large-scale, high-quality underwater datasets.

Method: Created USIM dataset with 15.6 hours of BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 scenarios, and developed U0 VLA model with multimodal fusion of binocular vision and sensors, plus convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement module (CAP).

Result: Achieved 80% success rate across inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking tasks, and reduced distance to target by 21.2% in mobile manipulation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotics, providing foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task autonomy, and realization of intelligent general underwater robots.

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater

Result: Improved agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes, achieving 2nd place among 16 teams in the challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances social navigation performance by incorporating collision risk understanding, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic human-populated environments.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal

TL;DR: DualTHOR is a dual-arm humanoid simulator with continuous transition and contingency mechanism, and Proprio-MLLM enhances MLLMs' embodiment awareness for better planning in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited effectiveness in long-horizon tasks with dual-arm humanoid robots due to lack of suitable simulation platforms and insufficient embodiment awareness for dual-arm selection and body position reasoning.

Method: Developed DualTHOR simulator for systematic evaluation and data collection, and proposed Proprio-MLLM that incorporates proprioceptive information using motion-based position embedding and cross-spatial encoder.

Result: Proprio-MLLM achieves 19.75% average improvement in planning performance compared to existing MLLMs that struggle in this environment.

Conclusion: The work provides both an essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRACE bridges the semantic-physical gap in robot manipulation by grounding VLM reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EACs) that encode object affordances and geometric constraints, enabling precise zero-shot manipulation without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap between VLMs' high-level semantic understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world robot manipulation. Current approaches lack the ability to translate semantic reasoning into physically feasible actions.

Method: GRACE uses executable analytic concepts (EACs) - mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and manipulation semantics. It employs a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that converts natural language instructions and visual information into instantiated EACs, from which grasp poses, force directions, and motion trajectories are derived.

Result: Extensive experiments show GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across various articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.

Conclusion: GRACE provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method that uses weighted averaging in SO(3) to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously for orientation learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold where non-Euclidean geometry causes distortion, making it difficult to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously in orientation learning.

Method: Uses angle-axis representation to generate multiple trajectories considering different local constraints at different basepoints, then fuses them using a weighted average mechanism in SO(3) to create smooth trajectories.

Result: The method successfully adapts orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points, copes with angular acceleration constraints, and incorporates multiple local constraints simultaneously to achieve smaller acceleration costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses the distortion issue in SO(3) and makes Euclidean learning algorithms applicable in non-Euclidean space, validated through simulations and experiments.

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

### [191] [Towards Reliable LLM-based Robot Planning via Combined Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08044)
*Shiyuan Yin,Chenjia Bai,Zihao Zhang,Junwei Jin,Xinxin Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CURE decomposes LLM uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic components for more reliable robot planning, using random network distillation and MLP regression to better align uncertainty estimates with actual execution outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucinations in robot planning cause overconfident but unsafe plans, and existing uncertainty estimation methods fail to properly differentiate between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, limiting reliability.

Method: CURE decomposes uncertainty into epistemic (task clarity and familiarity) and intrinsic uncertainty, estimated separately using random network distillation and MLP regression heads on LLM features.

Result: In kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments, CURE's uncertainty estimates were more closely aligned with actual execution outcomes compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Differentiating and separately estimating epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty improves the reliability of LLM-based robot planning by providing more accurate uncertainty assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver disease is a major global health burden, but expert sonographers are scarce in resource-limited regions. Current liver sonography requires significant expertise to locate multiple non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not visible.

Method: Developed an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot with: 1) AI agent integrating multi-modal perception with memory attention for localization of unseen target structures, 2) 588-gram 6-DOF cable-driven robot mounted on abdomen for motion robustness.

Result: The robot successfully autonomously acquired expert-level standard liver ultrasound planes and detected pathology in patients, including in high-altitude Xining city. System performed effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments.

Conclusion: This represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level diagnostics in underserved regions.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level
diagnostics in underserved regions.

### [193] [Accurate and Noise-Tolerant Extraction of Routine Logs in Robotic Process Automation (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08118)
*Massimiliano de Leoni,Faizan Ahmed Khan,Simone Agostinelli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A clustering-based technique for extracting routine logs from UI logs that outperforms existing methods, especially in noisy scenarios with inconsistent routine execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works don't directly focus on discovering routine-type models for robotic process automation and haven't been evaluated in noisy scenarios with inconsistent human routine execution.

Method: A clustering-based technique that extracts routine logs from UI logs, tested on nine UI logs with different levels of injected noise.

Result: The technique extracts more accurate routine logs than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the presence of noise, as shown by standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based approach effectively discovers routine logs for robotic process automation and demonstrates superior performance in handling noisy execution scenarios compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

Result: TRPO achieved lowest RMS errors across various trajectories and demonstrated robustness to larger time intervals between control updates.

Conclusion: TRPO's exploration-exploitation balance enables stable control in noisy environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency feedback, making it promising for complex robotic control tasks.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods

underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety, trust, and oversight issues caused by opaque AI decision-making in shared human-robot spaces by making complex multi-agent AI systems intuitively understandable.

Method: Uses three design principles: competition as clear metric (who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping), and sensor-to-sense mapping (robot cooperation/rivalry shown through forest and weather projections).

Result: Observations from five international exhibitions show audiences consistently read robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation in real time, with emotional reactions mirroring the system's internal state.

Conclusion: Sensory metaphors can effectively transform black box AI systems into public interfaces that are intuitively understandable.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public

*Filip Bečanović,Kosta Jovanović,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A faster and robust inverse optimal control method using single-level reformulation that reduces computation time by 15x while maintaining resilience to large noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IOC methods are either slow (bilevel process) or fast but noise-sensitive (optimality condition violation minimization). Need for a method that combines speed with robustness.

Method: Single-level reformulation of the bilevel IOC approach for equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, tested on human-like planar reaching tasks.

Result: The approach shows resilience to very large noise levels and reduces computation time by a factor of 15 compared to classical bilevel implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed single-level reformulation provides a faster and robust alternative to traditional IOC methods, achieving equivalent results with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to validate the size of the largest collision-free sphere for a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator using CAD software API to automate collision detection between manipulator legs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated approach for validating collision-free workspaces of parallel manipulators, specifically ensuring that no collisions occur between legs within the defined workspace sphere.

Method: Uses CAD software API to automatically update moving platform positions across samples within a shell enclosing the collision-free sphere surface, then checks each leg pair for mutual collisions at each pose.

Result: The method can validate precomputed collision-free spheres and estimate collision-free workspaces for spatial parallel manipulators by ensuring no points inside the sphere lead to leg collisions.

Conclusion: This CAD API-based approach provides an effective automated validation method for collision-free workspace analysis in parallel manipulators, particularly useful for Stewart-Gough platforms.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

TL;DR: GLUESTICK is a post-pruning recovery method for Vision-Language-Action models that restores functionality after pruning by interpolating between dense and pruned models in weight-space, requiring no additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning VLA models for deployment on resource-limited hardware leads to drastic performance degradation and increased safety violations, which current pruning methods don't adequately address for robotics applications.

Method: Performs one-time interpolation between dense and pruned models in weight-space to compute a corrective term, which is used during inference by each pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead.

Result: Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Conclusion: GLUESTICK provides an effective post-pruning recovery solution that is training-free, pruning-algorithm-agnostic, and introduces minimal overhead while maintaining sparsity benefits.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: R2RGen is a real-to-real 3D data generation framework that augments pointcloud observation-action pairs to create spatially diverse robotic manipulation data from minimal source demonstrations, without simulators or rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve spatial generalization in robotic manipulation, substantial human demonstrations covering different spatial configurations are needed, but current data generation methods face sim-to-real gaps and are limited to constrained settings.

Method: The framework uses fine-grained scene and trajectory parsing, group-wise augmentation for multi-object compositions and task constraints, and camera-aware processing to align with real-world 3D sensor distributions.

Result: R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency in extensive experiments and shows strong potential for scaling and application on mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed real-to-real 3D data generation framework effectively addresses spatial generalization needs in robotic manipulation while avoiding sim-to-real gaps and being efficient and plug-and-play.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

*Xueyi Liu,He Wang,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework for generalized in-hand object rotation that bridges the sim-to-real gap using a joint-wise dynamics model trained on limited real-world data, enabling a single policy to handle diverse objects and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant challenge of transferring dexterous manipulation policies from simulation to real world due to complex contact-rich dynamics, overcoming limitations of prior work that was constrained to simple geometries, limited object sizes, and customized hands.

Method: Joint-wise dynamics model that factorizes dynamics across joints, compresses system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learns each joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile. Paired with autonomous data collection strategy for gathering diverse real-world interaction data.

Result: Single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals), high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), small sizes, diverse wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and teleoperation application validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates unprecedented generality in dexterous manipulation, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap and enabling robust in-hand object rotation across diverse real-world conditions with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

TL;DR: NovaFlow is a zero-shot autonomous manipulation framework that converts task descriptions into actionable plans for robots without demonstrations, enabling cross-platform transfer by decoupling task understanding from low-level control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robot manipulation typically require in-distribution tasks or fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, which limits transferability across different robotic platforms.

Method: NovaFlow synthesizes videos from task descriptions using video generation models, distills them into 3D object flow using perception modules, computes relative poses for rigid objects (realized via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization), and uses flow as tracking objective for deformable objects with particle-based dynamics model.

Result: The framework was validated on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using both a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, achieving effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Conclusion: NovaFlow successfully enables zero-shot manipulation across different robotic embodiments by decoupling high-level task understanding from low-level control, demonstrating transferability without requiring platform-specific training data.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

TL;DR: The paper reveals poor correlation between offline and online evaluation of perception-based planning models for autonomous vehicles, proposes an epistemic uncertainty-based offline metric that improves correlation by over 13%, and validates findings in both simulation and real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline evaluation methods for autonomous driving policies don't reliably predict online performance, where minor errors can compound into serious infractions or collisions, creating a gap between evaluation practices and real-world safety.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments across diverse conditions and metrics in simulation, investigated an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty to capture events likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings, and validated findings in real-world settings.

Result: Found worse correlation between offline and online settings than previously reported, with the proposed epistemic uncertainty-based metric achieving over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics, and observed even greater gains in real-world validation.

Conclusion: Current evaluation practices for driving policies are questionable, but epistemic uncertainty-based offline metrics can significantly bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation, improving the validity of policy assessment.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

TL;DR: BLAZER is a framework that automatically generates training data for robotic manipulation tasks using LLM planners, enabling improved policy learning without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics lacks internet-scale demonstrations unlike vision and language domains, limiting dataset scale due to manual data collection requirements.

Method: Uses LLM planners to automatically generate demonstrations in simulation, then finetunes LLM on successful examples to improve planning capabilities.

Result: Significantly improves zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments, enables transfer to sensor-based manipulation, and allows downscaling of LLM models.

Conclusion: BLAZER provides an effective approach for scaling robotic learning through automated data generation, demonstrating improved generalization and real-world transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.
