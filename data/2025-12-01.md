TL;DR: SO-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to generate structured outputs from visual inputs according to predefined JSON schemas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used in real-world applications requiring structured outputs, but there's no systematic benchmark for evaluating their ability to extract and reason about information from visual inputs while conforming to data schemas.

Method: Created SO-Bench with over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs across four visual domains (UI screens, natural images, documents, charts), with human-verified quality. Conducted benchmarking experiments on open-source and proprietary models.

Result: Benchmarking revealed persistent gaps in models' ability to predict accurate, schema-compliant outputs from visual inputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Training experiments showed potential for improving structured output capabilities.

Conclusion: SO-Bench fills a critical gap in evaluating multimodal structured reasoning, reveals current limitations in MLLMs' visual structured output capabilities, and provides a foundation for future research and model improvement in this area.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world, agentic settings where outputs must not only be correct, but also conform to predefined data schemas. Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.

### [2] [Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Wilson Fearn,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFG uses positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions to guide score-based models without labeled data or extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods (CFG, Auto-Guidance) require labeled data or additional model training, limiting applicability when labeled data is unavailable or training new models is infeasible.

Method: Saddle-Free Guidance (SFG) leverages the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions to guide individual score-based models, maintaining estimates of maximal positive curvature without additional training.

Result: SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics for unconditional ImageNet-512 generation, and when combined with Auto-Guidance, achieves general state-of-the-art FD-DINOv2 scores. SFG also boosts diversity in FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 while maintaining prompt adherence and fidelity.

Conclusion: SFG provides an effective guidance method for score-based models that works without labeled data or additional training, matching CFG's computational cost while improving sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

*Bu Jin,Weize Li,Songen Gu,Yupeng Zheng,Yuhang Zheng,Zhengyi Zhou,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt: A diffusion-based framework that synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from single images, using unified latent representation for geometry, texture, segmentation, and kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of articulated 3D objects is costly and difficult to scale, limiting realistic simulation and robotics applications. Current methods are multi-stage and lack unified representation.

Method: UniArt uses diffusion-based framework with unified latent representation encoding geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. Introduces reversible joint-to-voxel embedding for spatial alignment of articulation features with volumetric geometry. Formulates articulation type prediction as open-set problem for generalization to novel joint categories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy on PartNet-Mobility benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in generating articulated 3D objects from single images.

Conclusion: UniArt provides an effective end-to-end solution for articulated 3D object synthesis from single images, overcoming limitations of multi-stage approaches and enabling generalization to novel object types through unified representation and open-set articulation prediction.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [4] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning is a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates Whole Slide Images through self-reflection and reasoning chains to identify diagnostically relevant regions without dense annotations, outperforming existing methods on cancer analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole Slide Images are crucial for cancer diagnosis but extremely large (up to 10B pixels), making manual navigation challenging and time-consuming for clinical inspection. Pathologists use sampling, reasoning, and self-reflection to navigate, inspiring an automated approach.

Method: PathReasoning iteratively navigates WSIs through multiple rounds: starting with random candidate regions, it reviews selections with self-reflection, reasons about visual-clinical correspondence, and proposes new regions to explore. This builds a reasoning chain that directs attention to relevant areas, turning slides into question-guided view sequences.

Result: Outperforms strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. High-quality ROIs support accurate breast cancer report generation, significantly outperforming GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy.

Conclusion: PathReasoning enables efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability by prioritizing question-specific regions and constructing interpretable reasoning chains in digital pathology.

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

*Cecilia G. Morales,Fanurs Chi En Teh,Kai Li,Pushpak Agrawal,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a training-free rPPG method that adaptively optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing parameters online based on signal quality, achieving unsupervised state-of-the-art performance comparable to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG methods use fixed parameters optimized for specific lighting and camera conditions, limiting their adaptability to diverse real-world deployment environments.

Method: Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment, requiring no training.

Result: State-of-the-art unsupervised performance: MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, with 97.3% and 97.5% accuracy at 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis shows equivalent performance to leading supervised methods (p > 0.2) with real-time CPU processing.

Conclusion: Adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG performance across diverse conditions, enabling training-free methods to achieve performance comparable to supervised approaches while maintaining real-time operation.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.

*Yupei Zhang,Yating Huang,Wanming Hu,Lequan Yu,Hujun Yin,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal prototyping framework integrates histology (WSI) and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing heterogeneity and missing data through biological prototyping, multiview alignment, bipartite fusion, and semantic genomics imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal integration of histology and genomics is promising for precision oncology but faces challenges from phenotypic/genotypic heterogeneity and real-world scenarios where genomics data may be partially missing or unavailable.

Method: Four-component framework: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion for shared and modality-specific information; 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation for missing data handling.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed flexible multimodal prototyping framework effectively integrates whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing key challenges in real-world clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

### [7] [AmodalGen3D: Generative Amodal 3D Object Reconstruction from Sparse Unposed Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21945)
*Junwei Zhou,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D is a generative framework for complete 3D object reconstruction from sparse, occluded views by jointly modeling visible and hidden regions using amodal completion priors and multi-view geometry conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle with incomplete reconstructions from few unposed and partially occluded views, which is common in real-world scenarios where many object surfaces are never directly observed.

Method: Integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, using View-Wise Cross Attention for sparse-view feature fusion and Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention for unobserved structure inference.

Result: Achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets, faithfully reconstructing 3D objects consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts.

Conclusion: Addresses a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications by enabling complete 3D reconstruction from sparse, occluded views.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

### [8] [TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21946)
*Finlay G. C. Hudson,James A. D. Gardner,William A. P. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPVid-360 introduces a new task for predicting 3D directions to queried scene points across video sequences, even when points are outside the camera's field of view, enabling allocentric scene understanding without 4D ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision systems lack persistent, panoramic understanding and struggle with object permanence beyond visible regions, particularly in the Track Any Point task where existing methods fail to track points outside the field of view.

Method: The approach uses 360 videos as supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across full panoramas using a 2D pipeline. A baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates.

Result: The paper introduces TAPVid360-10k dataset with 10k perspective videos and ground truth directional point tracking. The adapted CoTracker v3 baseline outperforms existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

Conclusion: TAPVid-360 enables learning allocentric scene representations without requiring dynamic 4D ground truth scene models, advancing persistent panoramic understanding in computer vision systems.

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

### [9] [WalkCLIP: Multimodal Learning for Urban Walkability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21947)
*Shilong Xiang,JangHyeon Lee,Min Namgung,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP is a multimodal AI framework that combines satellite imagery, street view imagery, and population dynamics to predict urban walkability, outperforming single-source approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional walkability assessments are costly and don't scale. Existing single-source approaches (satellite, street view, or population data alone) each capture only one dimension of the walking environment, missing complementary perspectives needed for comprehensive assessment.

Method: WalkCLIP integrates three data sources: 1) Learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, 2) Refines representations with spatial aggregation for neighborhood context, and 3) Fuses these with population dynamics foundation model representations.

Result: Evaluated at 4,660 locations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperformed unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment of walkability predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating complementary visual (satellite and street view) and behavioral (population dynamics) signals yields more reliable predictions of urban walking environments than single-source approaches.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

*Guying Lin,Kemeng Huang,Michael Liu,Ruihan Gao,Hanke Chen,Lyuhao Chen,Beijia Lu,Taku Komura,Yuan Liu,Jun-Yan Zhu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAT3D is the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics simulation to create physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes from text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D scene generation methods often produce physically implausible scenes with object intersections and unstable arrangements, lacking the physical realism needed for downstream applications like robotic manipulation and scene editing.

Method: PAT3D generates 3D objects from text prompts, infers spatial relations, organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, converts to simulation initial conditions, uses differentiable rigid-body simulation under gravity to achieve static equilibrium, and employs simulation-in-the-loop optimization to ensure physical stability and semantic consistency.

Result: PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality, and uniquely produces simulation-ready 3D scenes suitable for downstream tasks like scene editing and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: PAT3D represents a significant advancement in text-to-3D scene generation by integrating physics simulation to produce physically plausible, intersection-free scenes that are ready for practical applications beyond mere visualization.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

*Futian Wang,Chaoliu Weng,Xiao Wang,Zhen Chen,Zhicheng Zhao,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new large-scale benchmark dataset RPM-10K with 10,730 meter images addresses challenges in pointer meter reading, and a novel vision-language model MRLM uses physical relation injection for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pointer meter reading approaches are fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and difficulty distinguishing thin pointers from scale markings. The field lacks large-scale datasets to support robust algorithm development.

Method: Proposes MRLM, a novel vision-language model based on physical relation injection that explicitly encodes geometric and causal relationships between pointers and scales. Uses cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection to align perception with physical reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the new RPM-10K benchmark dataset containing 10,730 meter images that reflect real-world challenges.

Conclusion: The paper introduces both a large-scale dataset (RPM-10K) and a robust vision-language model (MRLM) that explicitly incorporates physical relationships for accurate pointer meter reading, addressing key challenges in smart power systems.

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

### [13] [PPBoost: Progressive Prompt Boosting for Text-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21984)
*Xuchen Li,Hengrui Gu,Mohan Zhang,Qin Liu,Zhen Tan,Xinyuan Zhu,Huixue Zhou,Tianlong Chen,Kaixiong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPBoost transforms weak text prompts into strong visual bounding boxes for zero-shot medical image segmentation, improving spatial precision without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-prompted models lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift, while visual-prompted models require costly precise bounding boxes that are hard to obtain clinically. There's a need to bridge text and visual prompting without labeled data.

Method: PPBoost uses vision-language models to generate initial pseudo-bboxes from text, filters unreliable predictions with uncertainty-aware criteria, trains a pseudo-labeled detector on retained image-bbox pairs, refines bboxes during inference by expanding them to cover targets, and uses enhanced bboxes to guide segmentation models.

Result: Across three diverse datasets, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines, and surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. It generalizes to multiple segmentation backbones.

Conclusion: PPBoost effectively amplifies weak text cues into strong spatial guidance for medical image segmentation, achieving superior zero-shot performance by bridging text and visual prompting without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundational benchmark and model for developing AI assistants capable of real-time interactive coaching with mistake detection and correction.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

*Sen Fang,Hongbin Zhong,Yalin Feng,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an acceleration pipeline for Rectified Flow models that achieves 611% speedup for 512×512 image generation, far surpassing existing 18% acceleration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow and Flow Matching models have improved generative model performance but existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied due to theoretical and design differences from diffusion models.

Method: Comprehensive acceleration pipeline including: batch processing with new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for flow-based models.

Result: Achieves up to 611% acceleration for 512×512 image generation, significantly outperforming existing public methods that typically achieve only 18% acceleration.

Conclusion: The proposed acceleration pipeline successfully addresses the unique challenges of Rectified Flow models and delivers substantial performance improvements beyond current non-generalized acceleration approaches.

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Shen Chen,Yijun Wang,Jianxin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedEyes is a reinforcement learning framework that models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to medical image regions, combining expert guidance with autonomous exploration for more accurate medical visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models using chain-of-thought reasoning via RLVR tend to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths, lacking the progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning observed in real clinical workflows.

Method: MedEyes incorporates off-policy expert guidance by converting expert visual search trajectories into behavioral signals. It uses a Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) with dual-mode exploration (scanning and drilling), a Confidence Value Sampler (CVS) for balanced exploration, and a dual-stream GRPO optimization framework to decouple learning signals.

Result: MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy in medical visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: MedEyes successfully models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by combining expert guidance with autonomous exploration, showing potential for building interpretable medical AI systems that better emulate real clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: Training-free uncertainty estimation method for VLMs using visual feature consistency and probabilistic embeddings to detect erroneous predictions without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP have strong classification performance but assign high confidence to misclassifications, limiting reliability in safety-critical applications where uncertainty estimation is crucial.

Conclusion: Proposed method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and provides effective uncertainty estimation for detecting erroneous predictions in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

*Joel Alberto Santos,Zongwei Wu,Xavier Alameda-Pineda,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Direct audio-visual object grounding from spoken instructions without text transcription can outperform traditional text-based methods, especially for handling linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object grounding methods rely on text transcription as an intermediate step, which may be inefficient and not robust to linguistic variations. The authors question whether direct audio-visual alignment without text is possible and potentially better.

Method: Simplified the task to single-word spoken instructions, created a new audio-based grounding dataset with diverse objects and accents, then adapted and benchmarked several audio-visual models from related fields.

Result: Direct audio grounding is feasible and in some cases outperforms transcription-based methods, particularly in robustness to linguistic variability (different accents and speech patterns).

Conclusion: Direct audio grounding shows promise for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems, encouraging renewed research interest in this approach.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple frequency-domain style adaptation for UDA that reduces domain gap with lightweight preprocessing, achieving strong performance on domain-adaptive object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state-of-the-art UDA methods are overly complex, relying on adversarial training or elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models, making them difficult to implement and deploy.

Method: Proposes learning to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce source-target domain discrepancy. Uses only a lightweight preprocessing module during training that's discarded at inference, incurring no additional computational overhead.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains on multiple domain-adaptive object detection benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness for scenarios where source domain annotations are accessible but target domain annotations are challenging to obtain.

Conclusion: Presents a simple yet effective UDA method that outperforms complex approaches while being practical for deployment with no inference-time overhead.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel transformer-based architecture for 3D scene occupancy forecasting directly from image features, bypassing BEV projections and discrete tokenization, achieving SOTA on nuScenes benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene occupancy forecasting rely on VAEs for discrete tokenization (limiting representational capacity) and BEV projections (introducing structural limitations), which hinder effective spatiotemporal dependency capture.

Method: Transformer-based architecture using sparse occupancy representation that directly processes raw image features end-to-end, avoiding intermediate BEV projection and discrete tokenization to better capture spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, significantly outperforming existing approaches, with robust scene dynamics understanding under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

Conclusion: Direct end-to-end forecasting from image features using transformer architecture with sparse occupancy representation is superior to methods relying on discrete tokenization and BEV projections for 3D scene occupancy forecasting.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

### [21] [ICM-SR: Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization for Image Super-Resoultion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22048)
*Junoh Kang,Donghun Ryu,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM (Image-Conditioned Manifold) regularization improves Real-ISR by using sparse structural information (colormap + Canny edges) instead of text conditioning, addressing color distortions and blur while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods use text-conditioned diffusion model manifolds, which are conceptually misaligned with the task (should be tied to LQ images) and practically produce color distortions/blurred edges. Raw image conditioning is unstable due to high information density.

Method: Proposes ICM (Image-Conditioned Manifold) regularization that conditions on sparse structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. This provides task-aligned, stable regularization signal instead of dense raw image conditioning.

Result: ICM significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality. The method avoids instability of dense-conditioning and improves final super-resolution quality for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Image-conditioned manifold regularization using sparse structural information (colormap + edges) provides better alignment with Real-ISR tasks and more stable regularization than text-conditioned approaches, leading to improved perceptual quality in super-resolution.

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

TL;DR: TPCNet: A Retinex-based low-light enhancement method using Triple Physical Constraints derived from Kubelka-Munk theory to model specular reflection and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based methods ignore specular reflection and use image-space constraints, limiting generalization. Need to incorporate specular reflection and reformulate physical constraints for better low-light enhancement.

Method: Propose Triple Physical Constraints (TPCs) theory based on Kubelka-Munk theory to model illumination, reflection, and detection relationships. Build TPCNet with physical constraints in feature space rather than image space.

Result: TPCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets, improves performance metrics and visual quality without adding parameters, as confirmed by comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating specular reflection via Kubelka-Munk theory and applying physical constraints in feature space significantly improves low-light image enhancement performance and generalization.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: DNA model enables online handwriting generation for unseen writers and characters, especially effective for glyph-based languages like Chinese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online handwriting generation methods fail to handle unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting real-world applications where new characters and writing styles constantly emerge.

Method: Proposes Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA) with two branches: adaptive style branch learns stroke attributes (direction, spacing, placement, flow), and adaptive content branch decomposes character content into structural information (via local encoder) and texture details (via global encoder) for better generalization to unseen characters.

Result: Extensive experiments show DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance in unseen online handwriting generation setting, demonstrating strong generalization to both unseen writers and characters.

Conclusion: DNA effectively addresses the challenge of generating handwriting for unseen characters and writers, making online handwriting generation more practical for real-world applications, especially for complex glyph-based languages.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: WorldWander presents an effective framework for translating between egocentric and exocentric video perspectives, addressing an important gap in video generation with applications in filmmaking, embodied AI, and world modeling.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored.

Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for brain age estimation often fail to capture continuous neuromorphological changes, leading to suboptimal feature representation. Brain age estimation could serve as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases that accelerate brain aging.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss for brain age estimation from T1w structural MRI, with ResNet backbone and Grad-RAM for visual explanation of regression results.

Result: Achieved MAE of 4.27 years and R² of 0.93 with limited training data, outperforming conventional deep regression and comparable to state-of-the-art methods with larger datasets. Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced age-related features with RNC loss.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures continuous brain aging patterns, shows potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders, and demonstrates correlation between brain age gap and disease severity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: Previous multi-modal fusion methods use single dense networks that struggle with significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance in 3D understanding tasks.

Method: Proposes MoE3D with MoE-based transformer, specialized expert networks for specific modalities/interactions, information aggregation module, Top-1 gating for efficiency, and progressive pre-training strategy leveraging semantic and 2D priors.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks, surpassing top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer benchmark.

Conclusion: MoE3D effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in 3D understanding through specialized expert networks and MoE architecture, demonstrating superior fusion capabilities and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperST: A hyperbolic space framework for predicting spatial transcriptomics gene expression from histology images using multi-level hierarchical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting gene expression from histology images fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of spatial transcriptomics data, particularly on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. There's also an information asymmetry challenge where gene expression contains molecular details lacking visual correlates in histology images.

Method: HyperST learns multi-level image-gene representations in hyperbolic space. It uses Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture spot-level and niche-level representations from both modalities, and a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module to unify these representations while performing spatial alignment and structuring embeddings hierarchically.

Result: HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, demonstrating improved cross-modal prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction by bridging the modality gap through hierarchical hyperbolic alignment, enriching image representations with molecular semantics.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

### [29] [PROMPTMINER: Black-Box Prompt Stealing against Text-to-Image Generative Models via Reinforcement Learning and Fuzz Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22119)
*Mingzhe Li,Renhao Zhang,Zhiyang Wen,Siqi Pan,Bruno Castro da Silva,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMPTMINER is a black-box prompt stealing framework that recovers text prompts from generated images using RL optimization for subjects and fuzzing search for stylistic modifiers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality text prompts for T2I models have become valuable digital assets vulnerable to theft, but prompt stealing also has beneficial applications like data attribution and watermarking validation. Existing methods have limitations like requiring white-box access, large labeled datasets, or relying solely on captioning without optimization.

Method: Two-phase framework: (1) Reinforcement learning-based optimization to reconstruct the primary subject from the image, and (2) fuzzing-driven search to recover stylistic modifiers. Operates in black-box setting without requiring gradient access or large labeled datasets.

Result: Achieves CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and SBERT textual alignment up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Outperforms strongest baseline by 7.5% in CLIP similarity on in-the-wild images with unknown generators. Maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations.

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER provides an effective black-box solution for prompt stealing that generalizes well to real-world scenarios and demonstrates robustness against defenses, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoPrune: An accelerated structured pruning method using ℓ₂,p-norm with efficient PAM optimization for CNN compression on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs suffer from high storage and computational costs on resource-constrained edge devices, and existing ℓp-norm pruning methods are limited to unstructured pruning with p∈(0,1) and have low computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes GoPrune method using ℓ₂,p-norm for sparse network learning (p extended to [0,1)), with efficient optimization based on proximal alternating minimization (PAM) that yields closed-form subproblem solutions.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR datasets with ResNet and VGG models demonstrate superior performance in network pruning compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GoPrune provides an effective structured pruning approach with improved computational efficiency for CNN compression on edge devices.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cue3D is a framework that systematically analyzes which image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, etc.) modern 3D generation models actually use, revealing that geometric cues like shading are more important than texture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep generative models have advanced single-image 3D generation, it's unclear which traditional monocular cues (shading, texture, silhouette, etc.) these methods actually exploit. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for developing more transparent and robust 3D generation systems.

Method: Cue3D is a model-agnostic framework that systematically perturbs individual image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, local continuity) and measures their impact on 3D output quality across seven state-of-the-art methods spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms.

Result: The analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness (not texture) dictates generalization, geometric cues (particularly shading) are crucial for 3D generation, models over-rely on provided silhouettes, and there are diverse sensitivities to cues like perspective and local continuity across different model families.

Conclusion: Cue3D advances understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models by identifying key cue dependencies.

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework that improves VLM generalization in video tasks by preventing semantic space narrowing through competitive prompting and generic attribute anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on video tasks impairs generalization to unseen classes due to semantic space narrowing, and existing regularization methods weaken soft prompt learning ability.

Method: 1) Competitive prompting: concatenate pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard tokens with soft tokens via learnable mapping layer; 2) Generic attribute anchors: use irrelevant video sets and negative prompts to maintain generic relevance in pre-trained semantic space.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction in video tasks.

Conclusion: The coupling prompt learning framework effectively mitigates semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning, preserving VLM generalization ability while maintaining learning capacity of soft prompts.

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

TL;DR: VIN (Virtual Inking Network) uses AI to autonomously identify surgical margins on pathology slides without physical ink, addressing variability in current practice and improving standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical margin assessment relies on physical inking which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure true margins on histological sections, affecting patient outcomes.

Method: VIN uses a frozen foundation model as feature extractor with a compact two-layer MLP for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features, trained on 120 H&E slides from tonsil tissue blocks with pathologist annotations.

Result: In blind testing on 20 unseen slides, VIN produced coherent margin overlays aligning with expert annotations, achieving ~73.3% region-level accuracy with errors confined to limited areas not disrupting whole-slide continuity.

Conclusion: VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and provides reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into digital pathology workflows and downstream margin distance measurement.

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

TL;DR: DualVLA addresses action degeneration in VLAs by using dual-layer data pruning and dual-teacher adaptive distillation to preserve both reasoning and action capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When training generalizable Vision-Language-Action models, there's a trade-off between reasoning capabilities and action performance - fine-tuning for reasoning often degrades action execution (action degeneration).

Method: Proposes DualVLA with: 1) Dual-layer data pruning to remove redundant embodied reasoning data, 2) Dual-teacher adaptive distillation that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains, and 3) VLA Score evaluation framework.

Result: Achieves 61.0% average success rate in SimplerEnv and 65.4 average score across eight multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating superior balance between action execution and multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: DualVLA effectively addresses the action degeneration problem in VLA models through careful data curation and adaptive distillation, enabling strong performance in both reasoning and action domains.

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: EASL introduces emotion-aware sign language generation that integrates multi-emotion guidance to create more expressive and natural sign language videos, addressing the emotional expressiveness gap in existing LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based sign language generation systems prioritize semantic accuracy but overlook emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness for the Deaf community.

Method: Proposes EASL with emotion-semantic disentanglement modules using progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features, then uses emotional representations to guide semantic interaction during pose decoding with 7-class emotion confidence scores.

Result: EASL achieves superior pose accuracy compared to all baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Conclusion: The emotion-aware approach successfully addresses the emotional expressiveness limitation in sign language generation, creating more natural and emotionally expressive communication for the Deaf community.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

TL;DR: Semantic-enabled network improves object detection in diverse weather by using semantics for image enhancement and detection, achieving 1.47-8.80% mAP gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based perception models are typically trained on clear weather data and struggle with diverse weather conditions. Existing weather-specific models lack adaptability and prioritize weather removal over comprehensive performance.

Method: Two-unit architecture: Preprocessing Unit (PPU) uses U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and Detection Unit (DTU) integrates semantic information with modified YOLO network for object detection.

Result: Achieves 1.47% to 8.80% improvement in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather conditions.

Conclusion: Semantics enable plausible content generation, boundary understanding, and visual coherency for all-weather transformations, offering a comprehensive approach to improve object detection performance in diverse weather.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stacked ensemble model using fine-tuned CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) with CatBoost meta-learner achieves 73% multiclass and 87.5% binary classification accuracy for knee osteoarthritis severity grading from X-ray images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee osteoarthritis severity grading using X-ray images and KL grading system requires expert interpretation, is time-consuming, and suffers from subjective variability, leading to potential diagnostic inaccuracies.

Method: Developed a stacked ensemble model with fine-tuned CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) as base learners and CatBoost as meta-learner for binary detection and multiclass KL grading of knee osteoarthritis.

Result: Achieved 73% balanced test accuracy for multiclass KL grading (5 levels) and 87.5% for binary KOA detection, outperforming previous works in literature.

Conclusion: The stacked ensemble approach provides an automated, accurate solution for KOA severity assessment that reduces subjectivity and expert dependency while improving diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Conclusion: RemedyGS provides the first comprehensive black-box defense solution against computation cost attacks on 3DGS systems, enabling reliable deployment of 3D reconstruction services by safeguarding against malicious resource consumption and DoS threats.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking face generation methods rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift problems.

Method: Uses cross-attention mechanism to implicitly model motion discrepancy and identity alignment in unified latent space; introduces identity-adaptive module for cross-identity reenactment; lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues.

Result: Surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization; achieves state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency (40 FPS for video-driven, 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on RTX 4090 GPU).

Conclusion: IMTalker provides an efficient, high-fidelity solution for talking face generation through implicit motion transfer, addressing limitations of traditional flow-based methods while maintaining speaker identity and achieving real-time performance.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

TL;DR: GRPO framework improves PM forecasting reliability in East Asia by reducing false alarms 47.3% while maintaining competitive F1-score, addressing operational cost asymmetry in public health alerts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models lack region-specific dynamics and real-time capabilities for East Asia's complex terrain, while standard point-wise objectives fail to account for asymmetric operational costs where false alarms erode public trust and missed severe events endanger populations.

Method: Created CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, then introduced Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities, addressing cost mismatch in forecasting.

Result: Reduced regional error by 59.5% with new dataset, and GRPO framework reduced False Alarm Rate by 47.3% compared to SFT-only baseline while achieving competitive F1-score for 48-120 hour forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves reliability of long-horizon PM forecasting for operational public health decisions in East Asia, balancing the critical trade-off between false alarms and missed severe events.

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBMs using LLMs/VLMs for concept generation face three key challenges: poor visual grounding (concepts not well-aligned with visual features), concept redundancy (overlapping concepts), and lack of metrics to balance predictive accuracy with concept compactness.

Method: Three core components: (1) multimodal concept generator combining LLM semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA) metric that jointly captures accuracy and concept compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts.

Conclusion: PS-CBM effectively addresses fundamental limitations of current CBMs, achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability through better visual grounding, reduced redundancy, and principled balancing of accuracy and compactness.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

Method: Proposes Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation that decomposes B-reps into unified local units, uses dual VQ-VAEs to encode vertex topology and VHPs into tokens, and trains a decoder-only Transformer for autoregressive token prediction.

Result: BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation and demonstrates versatility in conditional generation from various inputs (labels, point clouds, text, images) as well as autocompletion and interpolation tasks.

Conclusion: The single-stage autoregressive framework with VHP representation successfully addresses the limitations of multi-stage approaches, providing an efficient and versatile solution for B-rep generation across multiple applications.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

*Zhaoyang Wei,Wenchao Ding,Yanchao Hao,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRiP is a two-stage training framework that combines guided perception and reasoning to improve visual grounded reasoning in multimodal AI, achieving SOTA results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual reasoning are trapped between unstable RL and rigid SFT, leading to models that struggle to learn or lack cognitive flexibility for complex real-world scenes.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) cognitive-enhanced RL with Salience-Weighted IoU Reward (prioritizes critical object localization) and Multi-Heuristic Reward (encourages diverse valid reasoning pathways), initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on challenging benchmarks TreeBench and V* Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains in complex visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence, moving beyond simplistic rewards.

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

*Maitrayee Keskar,Mohan Trivedi,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTR-VP: Vision-based trajectory planning using ViT encoder to learn image context embeddings that replace map features in motion prediction, evaluated on Waymo dataset showing multi-future prediction improves planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop autonomous driving trajectory planning that uses visual scene understanding instead of traditional map-based features, learning context embeddings from raw images and past kinematic states.

Method: Uses ViT encoder with raw images and past kinematic state as input to produce context embeddings inspired by MTR encoder. Instead of MTR's learnable intention queries, uses cross attention on intent and context embeddings. Evaluated on Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset for 5-second trajectory prediction.

Result: Transformer-based methods combining visual and kinetic features are not effective at producing useful scene context embeddings, even with CLIP/DINOv2 augmentations. However, predicting multiple future trajectories instead of single trajectory boosts planning performance.

Conclusion: While vision-based context embeddings have limitations in scene understanding, multi-modal trajectory prediction (multiple futures) significantly improves planning performance for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with variable symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis challenging. Current diagnostic approaches lack accuracy and objectivity.

Method: Proposes a GCN model with Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for ASD classification. Uses multimodal data (rs-fMRI, sMRI, phenotypic) from ABIDE I dataset (870 patients). Creates population graph based on site-based similarity, processes each modality separately in multi-branch architecture, then concatenates features. Uses Chebyshev polynomial filters for localized spectral learning and GAT layers for attention-weighted aggregation.

Result: Achieves test accuracy of 74.82% and AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal GCN model with Chebyshev filters and attention mechanisms demonstrates superior performance for ASD diagnosis, offering a promising approach for early and objective identification of autism spectrum disorder using neuroimaging and phenotypic data.

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of zero-shot visual navigation in complex environments by creating a system that can perform long-horizon planning while maintaining robust local control, particularly under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

Method: Dual-scale framework with Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG) for global planning and VGGT-adapter for local geometry-enhanced control. Uses hybrid image-to-instance retrieval for path planning and switches between point-goal and image-goal navigation modes with periodic re-localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks, demonstrating robustness under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

Conclusion: MG-Nav successfully unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control, providing an effective solution for zero-shot visual navigation that maintains robustness in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present MG-Nav (Memory-Guided Navigation), a dual-scale framework for zero-shot visual navigation that unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control. At its core is the Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG), a compact, region-centric memory where each node aggregates multi-view keyframe and object semantics, capturing both appearance and spatial structure while preserving viewpoint diversity. At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space. MG-Nav operates global planning and local control at different frequencies, using periodic re-localization to correct errors. Experiments on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks demonstrate that MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and remains robust under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

TL;DR: FECO framework learns dense foot contact from single RGB images using shoe style-invariant adversarial training and ground-aware feature extraction to handle diverse shoe appearances and monotonous ground textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foot contact is critical for understanding human movement and physical interaction, but existing methods approximate it with zero-velocity constraints and focus on joint-level contact, missing detailed foot-world interaction. Dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images remains underexplored due to challenges with diverse shoe appearances and monotonous ground textures.

Method: FECO framework with two key components: 1) Shoe style adversarial training to enforce style-invariant features for contact estimation, overcoming shoe appearance diversity; 2) Ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context to effectively utilize ground information.

Result: The proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information, addressing the challenges of diverse shoe styles and monotonous ground appearance.

Conclusion: FECO framework successfully tackles the challenges of dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images through shoe style-invariant learning and ground-aware feature extraction, advancing accurate modeling of foot-world interaction.

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

Motivation: Accurate robot segmentation is crucial for robotic perception tasks like visual servoing, data augmentation, real-to-sim transfer, and safety monitoring, but remains challenging due to robot diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes.

Method: Built on SAM 2 foundation model with three key innovations: 1) structure-enhanced memory associator for articulated robots, 2) robot prompt generator to eliminate manual prompting, and 3) label-efficient training strategy to reduce annotation needs. Also created VRS dataset with 2.8k videos (138k frames).

Conclusion: RobotSeg provides a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution for robot segmentation that addresses the unique challenges of robotic systems and enables more advanced robotic perception capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF and 3DGS approaches neglect thermal infrared imagery and distinctive thermal characteristics like heat conduction and Lambertian properties, leaving multi-modal RGB-Thermal reconstruction underexplored.

Method: MrGS uses orthogonal feature extraction from a single appearance feature for RGB/thermal info, view-dependent/independent embedding strategies, Fourier's law for heat conduction modeling, and Stefan-Boltzmann/inverse-square laws for depth-aware thermal radiation mapping.

Result: MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians needed compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MrGS framework successfully integrates physics-based thermal modeling with 3D Gaussian Splatting for effective multi-modal RGB-Thermal scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

Result: Outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on three facial expression recognition datasets.

Conclusion: ARPGNet effectively learns mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations by modeling both appearance and facial region relationships, improving facial expression recognition performance.

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Real-world driving data lacks diversity in safety-critical and out-of-distribution scenarios needed for fully autonomous systems, requiring scalable simulation to complement limited human-collected corpus.

Method: Uses neural rendering with reactive environments to synthesize high-fidelity multi-view observations from perturbed ego trajectories, plus pseudo-expert trajectory generation for action supervision, followed by co-training on real and simulated data.

Result: Significant improvements in robustness and generalization for planning methods: +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest benchmarks, with smooth scaling using only simulation data without additional real-world data.

Conclusion: SimScale demonstrates effective sim-real learning with crucial findings on pseudo-expert design and scaling properties, providing a scalable solution for autonomous driving data diversity.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods rely on textual inversion which requires additional training time and lacks control ability over conditions like depth, pose, and text.

Method: Two innovations: (1) Uses off-the-shelf image adapter to generate 3D objects without textual inversion, enabling enhanced control over depth, pose, and text conditions. (2) Implements depth conditioned warmup strategy to improve 3D consistency.

Result: Shows qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance to text-inversion-based alternatives with improved 3D consistency. User study confirms better input image matching and 3D consistency maintenance.

Conclusion: Proposed Control3D-IP method effectively addresses limitations of textual inversion by providing better control, efficiency, and improved 3D consistency in 3D object generation.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods produce inconsistent results across different views of the same scene, which is problematic for editing 3D representations like NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion framework with a consistency loss that guides diffusion sampling toward coherent edits, based on the assumption that corresponding points in unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing.

Conclusion: The framework provides flexible, training-free multi-view consistent editing that works with various image editing methods and supports both dense and sparse multi-view setups.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs are limited to single-image understanding, while real clinical workflows require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities/time points. Lack of large-scale annotated multi-image data hinders development of medical MLLMs with composite reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed a novel framework using license-permissive compound images from biomedical literature as training data.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications by leveraging underutilized compound figures as training data.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: IE-SRGS: A novel 3D Gaussian Splatting super-resolution method that combines external 2D super-resolution priors with internal 3DGS features to overcome cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps for high-fidelity reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing high-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting models from low-resolution inputs rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution models, which suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity due to cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps between 2D and 3D domains.

Method: IE-SRGS jointly leverages external 2DSR priors (HR images and depth maps from 2DSR and depth estimation models) and internal 3DGS features (cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts from multi-scale 3DGS models), integrated through a mask-guided fusion strategy to guide 3D Gaussian optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS effectively addresses the limitations of existing 2DSR-based approaches by synergistically combining external and internal knowledge sources, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting models from low-resolution inputs.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Motivation: Accurate 3D microscopy segmentation is critical but current foundation models produce error-prone results, requiring manual curation for high-quality training data or error correction before analysis.

Method: VessQC integrates uncertainty maps to direct user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors, enabling uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations.

Abstract: Accurate 3D microscopy image segmentation is critical for quantitative bioimage analysis but even state-of-the-art foundation models yield error-prone results. Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction.

TL;DR: Using SAM with adversarial perturbations to detect image tampering by making SAM "blind" to original content so it only sees forged regions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC-based image editing simplifies realistic image modification, creating serious risks of image forgery that need detection methods

Method: Transform images into "blank canvas" for neural models using adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from seeing original content, with frequency-aware optimization to enhance tamper localization

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in detecting tampered regions

Conclusion: Novel SAM-based approach using adversarial perturbations and frequency optimization provides effective solution for AIGC image forgery detection

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTSnap improves test-time scaling for diffusion models by pruning low-quality noise seeds early using noise-aware reward models trained via self-distillation, reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods for text-to-image diffusion models require fully denoising multiple noise seeds to evaluate rewards, which is computationally expensive and limits exploration under fixed budgets.

Method: Train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align rewards for intermediate noisy estimates with final clean images, using curriculum training from clean to noisy data, enabling early pruning of poor candidates.

Result: Improves performance by over 16% compared to existing methods, enables more efficient test-time scaling, and provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local optimization.

Conclusion: TTSnap offers an effective framework for computationally efficient test-time scaling by addressing the reward alignment challenge between intermediate noisy estimates and final clean images.

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

### [60] [Semantic Anchoring for Robust Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22245)
*Seoyun Yang,Gihoon Kim,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic anchoring guides diffusion model personalization by grounding new concepts in pretrained distributions, improving both subject fidelity and text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with personalization - they either overfit to reference images (losing semantic prior) or preserve prior too much (failing to learn new attributes). Need balanced approach.

Method: Proposes semantic anchoring that reformulates personalization as learning rare concepts guided by frequent counterparts. Anchors new concepts in corresponding pretrained distributions for stable adaptation.

Result: Achieves stable adaptation with consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness.

Conclusion: Semantic anchoring enables controlled expansion of pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving semantic structure, solving the personalization trade-off.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqWarm: A frequency warm-up curriculum that improves generation quality in latent diffusion models by increasing early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during training, addressing the reconstruction-generation trade-off in high-dimensional autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models face a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off where higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but degrade generation quality. This stems from decoders depending on high-frequency latent components for detail recovery while encoders under-represent high-frequency content, causing insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands during diffusion training.

Method: FreqWarm is a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. It explicitly manages frequency exposure to make high-dimensional latent spaces more diffusible targets.

Result: FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality across several high-dimensional autoencoders: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32. The method is architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

Conclusion: Explicitly managing frequency exposure through curriculum learning can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets, bridging the reconstruction-generation gap in latent diffusion models without requiring autoencoder modifications.

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

Motivation: Current medical foundation models lack comprehensive ultrasound solutions that can handle both pixel-level structural understanding and complex clinical reasoning tasks simultaneously.

Method: Introduces UMind-DS dataset (1.2M ultrasound image-text pairs) and UMind-VL architecture with Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs, unifying multiple tasks with task-specific tokens.

Result: Outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: UMind-VL successfully bridges ultrasound grounded perception with comprehensive interpretation, demonstrating strong generalization ability while unifying multiple clinical tasks in a single framework.

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS watermarking schemes claim to protect copyright, but their actual robustness is questionable. The authors want to systematically explore vulnerabilities in 3DGS watermarking frameworks and develop effective removal methods.

Method: GSPure analyzes view-dependent rendering contributions and uses geometrically accurate feature clustering to precisely isolate and remove watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity.

Result: GSPure achieves best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity (less than 1dB PSNR loss). Consistently outperforms existing methods in effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS watermarking and introduces GSPure as an effective purification framework, raising important questions about the robustness of current 3D asset protection methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

Motivation: Existing video colorization methods suffer from temporal flickering issues or require extensive manual input, creating a need for automated, high-fidelity solutions.

Method: Uses language-conditioned diffusion model with automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; employs optical flow (RAFT) for temporal stability by warping color from previous frames, plus correction step for inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS30 and VIDEVO20 benchmarks in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed automated approach using semantic guidance from language and segmentation enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent video colorization without manual color input.

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVGGT adapts VGGT for autonomous driving by incorporating AD-specific priors like minimal camera overlap, known intrinsics/extrinsics, and fixed relative camera positions to achieve scale-aware 4D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of VGGT to autonomous driving systems yields suboptimal results due to different task priors. AD systems have unique characteristics: minimal camera overlap, known camera parameters, and fixed relative camera positions despite ego motion.

Method: Proposes DriveVGGT with three key components: 1) Temporal Video Attention (TVA) for independent multi-camera video processing, 2) Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) with normalized pose embeddings for cross-camera consistency, and 3) Extended heads for absolute scale and ego pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, and fastVGGT on autonomous driving datasets. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of proposed designs.

Conclusion: DriveVGGT successfully integrates AD-specific priors into feed-forward reconstruction, enabling scale-aware 4D reconstruction tailored for autonomous driving data.

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "patch collapse" - a phenomenon where observing certain image patches reduces uncertainty in others, analogous to quantum wave function collapse. The authors develop methods to identify optimal patch realization order and show this benefits masked image modeling and enables efficient vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that certain image patches contain more information about the overall image structure than others, and realizing these key patches first can reduce uncertainty in remaining patches more efficiently. This is analogous to quantum mechanics where observing a particle collapses its wave function.

Method: The authors learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. They then use PageRank scoring on the learned patch dependencies to determine optimal patch realization order. This collapse order is applied to improve masked image modeling methods.

Result: The method boosts autoregressive image generation when retraining MAR (state-of-the-art model). For image classification, Vision Transformers achieve high accuracy with only 22% of high-rank patches in the collapse order, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Patch collapse provides a novel perspective for efficient image modeling, showing that respecting optimal patch realization order benefits various vision tasks and enables substantial computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

TL;DR: RS-EoT addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing vision-language models by introducing an iterative evidence-seeking paradigm with SocraticAgent and progressive RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models in remote sensing suffer from "pseudo reasoning" where they narrate reasoning processes rather than genuinely reasoning based on visual evidence, caused by the "Glance Effect" from coarse perception of large-scale imagery.

Method: Proposes RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. Uses SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. Implements two-stage progressive RL: first RL on fine-grained grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, then RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding.

Result: RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses confirm iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, showing RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed RS-EoT paradigm effectively addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing by enabling genuine evidence-grounded reasoning through iterative visual evidence seeking, overcoming the limitations of the Glance Effect in large-scale imagery analysis.

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only handle individual images or densely sampled videos, lacking the ability to generate consistent unstructured image sets where images share common content but differ in viewpoint, time, and surrounding elements.

Method: Models the task as a graph where each node is an image and each edge triggers joint generation of image pairs. Fuses internal features across image pairs using dense input correspondences without masks or manual supervision, leveraging text-to-image models' emergent prior for coherent multi-view generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, enabling new capabilities for content creation from image collections through set-to-set generation.

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse provides an effective zero-shot, training-free framework for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets, advancing content creation from image collections.

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

Result: Student model (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4% ANLS and 82.4% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection/OCR at inference. Validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain, iterative refinement adds 9.7 mAP improvement.

Conclusion: DocVAL successfully transfers spatial reasoning capabilities from large teachers to deployable students, releasing 95k high-quality CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

TL;DR: MVMAE is a self-supervised framework that uses multi-view radiology images and text reports to learn robust medical representations, outperforming baselines on disease classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ML systems need pretraining strategies that exploit clinical data structure. Radiology studies have natural multi-view organization that can be leveraged for learning view-invariant and disease-relevant representations.

Method: MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment using multi-view radiology images. MVMAE-V2T extends this by incorporating radiology reports as auxiliary text-based learning signals while maintaining vision-only inference.

Result: MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines on disease classification across three large-scale datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, PadChest). MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, especially in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: Structural (multi-view) and textual supervision are complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models, with MVMAE frameworks demonstrating their effectiveness.

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

TL;DR: CoT4AD introduces Chain-of-Thought reasoning to Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving, enhancing numerical and causal reasoning capabilities through explicit training and implicit inference reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning.

Method: CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action Chain-of-Thought to align reasoning space with action space. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning for consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making.

Result: Extensive experiments on both real-world (nuScenes) and simulated (Bench2Drive) benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations.

Conclusion: CoT4AD successfully addresses the limitations of existing VLA models by introducing Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieving superior performance in complex driving scenarios through enhanced numerical and causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Swin Transformer-based neck architecture for CenterNet to improve small bird detection by adapting window sizes to small objects


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection is challenging due to size, blur, and occlusion. Existing methods work well for small dense objects but fail for small sparse objects like birds where training data is limited, requiring specialized feature learning approaches.

Method: Uses Swin Transformer in the neck (between backbone and prediction head) with hierarchical design to upsample image features. Adapts shifted window sizes specifically for small objects, experimenting with different window configurations for CenterNet.

Result: Swin Transformer-based neck with CenterNet achieves good performance for small bird detection. Smaller window sizes (default 2) improve mAP for small object detection compared to larger window sizes.

Conclusion: Adapting Swin Transformer window sizes for small objects in the neck architecture effectively improves feature learning for small sparse object detection, particularly for challenging categories like birds.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual CoT accelerates convergence but doesn't improve final performance; concise grounding-focused CoT with minimal essential steps generalizes best across different maze sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of generalizable visual reasoning in VLMs, particularly why specific CoT formats help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning.

Method: Used controlled maze-solving benchmark with fully visual reasoning rules, tunable difficulty via grid size, and automatically generated intermediate steps. Compared three CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinates), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations) using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under standard SFT-then-RL pipeline.

Result: Visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but don't lift final performance ceiling; concise CoT with only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; CoT retaining only minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes.

Conclusion: Reveals a "short is long" effect where concise, grounding-focused CoT generalizes better than verbose alternatives, providing practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

*Haoxi Zeng,Haoxuan Li,Yi Bin,Pengpeng Zeng,Xing Xu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HarmoCLIP addresses CLIP's limited fine-grained understanding by harmonizing global and region representations through explicit local alignment without disrupting global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP lacks region-level supervision, limiting its fine-grained semantic understanding. Existing methods to improve local perception unintentionally disrupt global alignment, creating a persistent trade-off between local and global representations.

Method: Introduces explicit fine-grained semantic supervision to directly align textual segments with corresponding visual regions, plus a Region-Language Alignment strategy that promotes local learning without compromising global consistency.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on global retrieval tasks (up to 69.78% improvement) and 3.2% Top-1 accuracy improvement on bounding-box classification, outperforming prior approaches while providing balanced, efficient plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP successfully harmonizes global and region representations in CLIP, resolving the trade-off between local perception and global coherence through explicit fine-grained alignment strategies.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

TL;DR: MLLM evaluations for multiple-choice VQA are highly sensitive to minor, semantically neutral prompt format variations, revealing unexplored biases that persist despite existing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations, particularly in multiple-choice VQA benchmarks.

Method: Conducted large-scale study with 7 MLLMs and 5 VQA datasets, testing 48 distinct prompt format variations to analyze impact of three key variation factors in prompt formatting.

Result: Multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes even when semantically neutral; biases persist independently of known order biases or model confidence; existing mitigation strategies fail to address these new biases.

Conclusion: Current MLLM evaluations for multiple-choice VQA have significant reliability issues due to unexplored prompt formatting biases that require new mitigation approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gaze accuracy in VR/AR applications is insufficient for spatial computing requirements, necessitating more precise gaze tracking solutions.

Method: Created GazeTrack benchmark dataset with diverse demographics; developed shape error regularization for pupil ellipse fitting; invented paper unfolding-like coordinate transformation for gaze vector prediction; built optimized gaze vector generation model.

Result: Achieved reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to existing methods on the comprehensive GazeTrack dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with novel regularization and transformation techniques significantly improves gaze tracking accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, advancing spatial computing capabilities.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

TL;DR: A novel alignment strategy for Normalizing Flows that leverages their invertibility to align generative pass features with vision foundation model representations, achieving faster training and improved generative quality and classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Normalizing Flows have limited generative quality due to poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. The authors aim to improve NF performance by better leveraging their invertible architecture for representation learning.

Method: Proposes an alignment strategy that aligns intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, rather than regularizing the forward pass. Also introduces a training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification to better evaluate semantic knowledge.

Result: The approach accelerates NF training by over 3.3× while simultaneously improving both generative quality and classification accuracy. Achieves new state-of-the-art results for NFs on ImageNet 64×64 and 256×256.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment strategy effectively leverages the invertibility of NFs to improve their semantic representations, leading to faster training and better performance in both generation and classification tasks.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches for KB-VQA suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes ReAG with: 1) Coarse- and fine-grained retrieval, 2) Critic model to filter irrelevant passages, 3) Multi-stage training strategy using reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, with supervised fine-tuning as cold start.

Result: Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek show ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

Conclusion: ReAG effectively addresses limitations of current retrieval-augmented approaches for KB-VQA by combining improved retrieval with enhanced reasoning capabilities, demonstrating superior performance on knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions, combining super-resolution, localization, semantic alignment, and vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detectors degrade under real-world conditions (downsampling, compression, cross-domain shifts) and operate as opaque classifiers without explanations, undermining trust in high-stakes applications.

Method: Combines hierarchical super-resolution to amplify forensic cues, Grad-CAM multi-scale localization to reveal generative patterns, CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors, and vision-language model with ReAct + Chain-of-Thought prompting for explanations, verified through dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline.

Result: Substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation across diverse domains (animals, vehicles, abstract scenes), outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines.

Conclusion: INSIGHT provides a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and represents a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

TL;DR: DIPT learns domain-invariant prompts for pathology VLMs, improving domain generalization through knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in computational pathology (staining protocols, scanners, imaging settings) limit generalization. Existing VLMs like PLIP have limited zero-shot performance due to prompt sensitivity and lack of semantic descriptors for histopathology domains.

Method: Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) learns multiple input tokens per domain, trains them separately, then averages across domains to create domain-invariant prompts. A student model distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder using these prompts to align visual features with domain-invariant embeddings.

Result: Significant improvement in average F1-score over existing SOTA knowledge distillation approaches for domain generalization in histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: DIPT enables deployment of robust computational pathology models in real-world clinical settings with heterogeneous data sources by enhancing domain generalization through domain-invariant prompt learning.

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

TL;DR: AnchorFlow introduces a training-free 3D editing method using latent anchor consistency to achieve stable, semantically faithful edits without mask supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free 3D editing methods struggle with producing strong or geometrically stable edits due to inconsistent latent anchors caused by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling.

Method: AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between source and target trajectories, enforcing coherence through a relaxed anchor-alignment loss and anchor-aligned update rule, ensuring stable transformations without mask supervision.

Result: Experiments on Eval3DEdit benchmark show AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications while preserving geometric fidelity through latent anchor consistency, making it an effective mask-free solution for training-free 3D editing.

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

TL;DR: Three-channel DDPM generates realistic dual-view mammograms with good cross-view consistency, showing promise for dataset augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and evaluate a three-channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model for synthesizing single breast dual-view mammograms and assess how different channel representations affect image quality and cross-view consistency.

Method: Fine-tuned a pretrained three-channel DDPM on 11,020 screening mammograms to generate paired CC and MLO views. Evaluated three third-channel encodings (sum, absolute difference, zero channel), generated 500 synthetic pairs, and assessed using breast mask segmentation (IoU, DSC), distributional comparisons (EMD, KS tests), and visual Turing test by a radiologist.

Result: Synthetic mammograms showed comparable IoU/DSC distributions to real images (EMD=0.020, KS=0.077). Sum and absolute difference encodings outperformed others (p<0.001). Generated views maintained cross-view consistency with 6-8% showing artifacts consistent with training data.

Conclusion: Three-channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual-view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation for medical imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

TL;DR: UAV-MM3D is a large-scale multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception with 400K frames across diverse scenes, weather conditions, and five sensor modalities, addressing data scarcity in real-world UAV data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world UAV data collection faces constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly.

Method: Created a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset (UAV-MM3D) with 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes and weather conditions, featuring multiple UAV models and five modalities (RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, DVS). Also proposed LGFusionNet (LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline) and a UAV trajectory prediction baseline.

Result: The dataset provides comprehensive annotations including 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core UAV perception tasks like 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D offers a public benchmark with controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations to advance 3D perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments.

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffStyle360: A diffusion-based framework for 3D head stylization that generates multi-view consistent stylizations from a single style reference without per-style training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D head stylization methods require computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning for each new style, limiting practical application and flexibility.

Method: Builds on DiffPortrait360 architecture with two key components: Style Appearance Module for style-content disentanglement, and Style Fusion Attention for adaptive structure-stylization balance. Uses 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for fine-tuning and temperature-based key scaling for stylization intensity control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based methods on FFHQ and RenderMe360 datasets, achieving superior style quality across challenging artistic domains with multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: DiffStyle360 enables efficient, high-quality 3D head stylization from single style references without per-style training, advancing practical applications in digital media and character design.

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

*Minghao Yin,Yukang Cao,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WUKONG is a training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing using flow-based transformers, solving optimal transport barycenter problems for smooth shape transitions and preserving texture details through semantic consistency mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 3D morphing methods rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation, which limits generalization and requires costly preprocessing. There's a need for a more efficient, high-fidelity approach to textured 3D morphing that can handle diverse geometry and texture variations.

Method: WUKONG leverages flow-based transformer generative priors for training-free 3D morphing. It formulates morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem for smooth shape transitions, uses sequential initialization to prevent geometric distortions, and implements similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanisms for texture preservation with precise blending control.

Result: Extensive evaluations show WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations with high-fidelity transitions and rich texture details while avoiding common artifacts like oversmoothing.

Conclusion: WUKONG provides an effective training-free framework for high-quality textured 3D morphing that overcomes limitations of conventional methods, offering better generalization, reduced preprocessing requirements, and superior performance in preserving both geometric and textural details.

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

### [86] [Leveraging Textual Compositional Reasoning for Robust Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22903)
*Kyu Ri Park,Jiyoung Park,Seong Tae Kim,Hong Joo Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORTEX is a novel change captioning framework that integrates textual cues from VLMs with visual features to better capture subtle changes through compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change captioning methods rely solely on visual features, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack explicit structured information about object relationships and compositional semantics.

Method: CORTEX integrates textual cues with visual features using three modules: 1) Image-level Change Detector for low-level visual differences, 2) Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) using VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions, and 3) Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) to align visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning.

Result: The framework enables reasoning over both visual and textual features to capture changes that are ambiguous in visual features alone, enhancing change understanding through complementary textual cues.

Conclusion: By integrating textual knowledge from VLMs with visual features, CORTEX provides a more comprehensive approach to change captioning that can capture subtle changes through compositional reasoning, addressing limitations of visual-only methods.

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

*Weining Ren,Hongjun Wang,Xiao Tan,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fin3R is a lightweight fine-tuning method that improves feed-forward 3D reconstruction models by distilling fine geometric details from a monocular teacher model using LoRA adapters on the encoder only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (i) scarcity of high-fidelity depth/pose supervision and (ii) inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression.

Method: Freeze the decoder (handles view matching) and fine-tune only the image encoder using a custom lightweight LoRA adapter. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large unlabeled datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only tiny LoRA weights that leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Conclusion: Fin3R is a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method that addresses key limitations of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models by leveraging knowledge distillation from monocular teachers through targeted encoder fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkeletonAgent is a novel framework that integrates LLMs with skeleton-based action recognition through cooperative Questioner and Selector agents to provide targeted discriminative guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use LLMs in isolation without performance feedback, failing to provide targeted discriminative cues needed to distinguish similar actions in skeleton-based recognition.

Method: Proposes SkeletonAgent with two cooperative agents: Questioner identifies confused classes for LLM context, and Selector parses LLM responses to extract joint-level constraints for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, UAV-Human) show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent successfully bridges recognition models and LLMs through cooperative agents, enabling targeted discriminative guidance and finer-grained cross-modal alignment for improved skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Motivation: To create an efficient text-to-image model that achieves high-quality text rendering under computational constraints, bridging the gap between frontier-level performance and practical deployment.

Method: Built on Ovis-U1 framework with diffusion-based visual decoder and stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, using text-centric training pipeline combining large-scale pre-training with tailored post-training refinements.

Result: Achieves text rendering performance comparable to larger open models (Qwen-Image) and approaches closed-source systems (Seedream, GPT4o) while remaining deployable on single high-end GPU with moderate memory.

Conclusion: Strong multimodal backbone combined with carefully designed text-focused training recipe enables reliable bilingual text rendering without oversized or proprietary models, making high-quality text rendering practically deployable.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

TL;DR: ABounD: Adversarial Boundary-Driven framework for few-shot multi-class anomaly detection that combines semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping to better distinguish subtle defects from atypical normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection is challenging due to data scarcity blurring boundaries between normal and abnormal states, causing missed subtle defects and rejection of atypical normal samples. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative.

Method: Unified learning framework with Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module for class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, and Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) that sculpts precise decision margins via PGD-style perturbations to generate boundary-level fence features. Single-stage training under Concept-Boundary Loss with semantic-spatial regularizers.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets for few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Conclusion: ABounD effectively addresses the boundary ambiguity problem in few-shot anomaly detection by synergistically combining semantic concept learning with adversarial boundary shaping, yielding decision boundaries that closely follow normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment.

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on spurious correlations (shortcut learning), leading to poor generalization in new environments. Multiple spurious correlations can coexist in medical imaging, and misclassifications can have severe consequences for patient care.

Method: MIMM-X framework disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. This enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts.

Result: Evaluated on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Conclusion: MIMM-X provides an effective solution for addressing shortcut learning in medical imaging by disentangling causal features from multiple spurious correlations, leading to more robust and generalizable models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generation has advanced significantly, creating realistic manipulated media that raises serious misuse concerns. There's an urgent need for robust and reliable deepfake detection, particularly focusing on zero-shot detection (generalizable detection) that works across different generation techniques.

Method: Proposes FauxNet based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. Extracts temporal VSR features from videos to identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. Focuses on zero-shot detection setting. Also introduces new datasets: Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF with ~38,000 real and fake videos created with six recent deepfake generation techniques.

Result: FauxNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot detection setting. The network can also attribute videos to their specific generation techniques. Extensive analysis on Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++ demonstrates FauxNet's superiority.

Conclusion: FauxNet provides an effective solution for deepfake detection using VSR features, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot detection performance and enabling attribution of generation techniques. The new Authentica datasets will be publicly available to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ViRL introduces visual rationalization as core reasoning primitives (visual analogue of Chain-of-Thought) and trains models end-to-end with process supervision and fine-grained credit assignment to ensure visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat visual actions as optional tools, creating an "illusion of thinking with images" where models appear visually grounded but actually rely on context-agnostic actions that don't refine perception or guide reasoning toward correct answers.

Method: Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL) - an end-to-end paradigm with three components: (1) Process Supervision using ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions.

Result: ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning when trained purely with end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Visual rationalization establishes a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models that get the right answer for the right visual reason.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

TL;DR: CNNs with min-max normalization offer the best practical trade-off for quantum dot state recognition, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency better than more complex models like U-Nets and ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling quantum dot arrays requires automated tuning strategies that depend on accurately identifying device states from charge-stability diagrams, necessitating effective machine learning approaches for state recognition.

Method: Benchmarked four ML architectures (U-Nets, visual transformers, MDNs, CNNs) for multi-class state recognition in double-QD charge-stability diagrams, evaluating performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data.

Result: U-Nets and ViTs achieved highest MSE scores on synthetic data (>0.98) but failed to generalize to experimental data; MDNs were computationally efficient with stable training but lower performance; CNNs offered the best trade-off on experimental data with strong accuracy and far fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CNNs with min-max normalization provide the most practical approach for quantum dot charge-stability diagram analysis, offering strong performance with computational efficiency while effectively handling experimental data.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

TL;DR: Generative inpainting of non-anatomical markers in pediatric hand radiographs severely degrades AI performance for bone age and gender prediction, despite appearing visually realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether generative foundation model-based inpainting for artifact removal preserves clinically relevant features needed for bone age estimation and gender prediction in pediatric hand radiographs.

Method: Used RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset with 200 original radiographs, generated 600 inpainted versions using gpt-image-1 with natural language prompts targeting non-anatomical artifacts. Assessed downstream performance with deep learning ensembles using MAE for bone age and AUC for gender classification, plus pixel intensity distribution analysis.

Result: Inpainting markedly degraded performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images showed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies indicating structural modifications.

Conclusion: Despite visual realism, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when editing non-diagnostic regions, requiring rigorous task-specific validation before clinical AI integration.

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods only verify authenticity but fail to address the crucial question of intent behind manipulated videos, which is essential for understanding societal and security risks.

Method: Created IntentHQ benchmark with 5,168 videos annotated with 23 fine-grained intent categories. Used supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models integrating spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis.

Result: Developed a streamlined model capable of differentiating between a wide range of intent categories including financial fraud, indirect marketing, political propaganda, and fear mongering.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a paradigm shift from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos, providing a framework for analyzing the underlying motivations and goals behind manipulated content.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale benchmark for Indian language scene text recognition with 100K+ words across 11 Indian languages and English, addressing the lack of quality datasets for this challenging domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge despite English scene text recognition being nearly solved, due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, varying writing styles, and lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models.

Method: Created BSTD with 100K+ words spanning 11 Indian languages and English from 6,500+ scene images across India, with meticulous annotations supporting four tasks: text detection, script identification, cropped word recognition, and end-to-end recognition. Evaluated state-of-the-art English models by fine-tuning them for Indian languages.

Result: The dataset represents a significant advancement for Indian language scene text research, and evaluation of adapted English models revealed both challenges and opportunities in this domain, highlighting the need for specialized approaches.

Conclusion: BSTD is a crucial step toward advancing Indian language scene text recognition research, with all models and data being open source to foster further development in this important area.

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

TL;DR: ITS3D improves text-to-3D generation quality through inference-time scaling without retraining, using optimization to find optimal Gaussian noise inputs via verifier-guided search with three key techniques for stability, efficiency, and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative quality in text-guided 3D diffusion models without requiring additional training, addressing the need for better inference-time performance in 3D generation tasks.

Method: ITS3D formulates inference-time scaling as an optimization problem to find optimal Gaussian noise inputs. It uses a verifier-guided search algorithm with three techniques: 1) Gaussian normalization to stabilize search by correcting distribution shifts, 2) SVD-based compression to reduce high-dimensional search space complexity, and 3) singular space reset mechanism to prevent local minima convergence by dynamically updating search space based on diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, showing the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Conclusion: ITS3D successfully improves 3D generation quality through inference-time optimization without retraining, offering a practical approach for enhancing diffusion model performance through efficient search algorithms.

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

TL;DR: SpaceMind is a new VLM that excels at 3D spatial reasoning from just RGB images by using camera information as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning tasks like distance estimation and size comparison, and existing 3D-aware methods either need auxiliary 3D data or use shallow feature fusion with geometry encoders.

Method: Uses dual-encoder architecture with VGGT (spatial understanding) and InternViT (2D visual). Introduces Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module that applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns geometric importance weights, and gates fused representations with camera embeddings.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on VSI-Bench, SQA3D, and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins, and achieves SOTA on SQA3D.

Conclusion: Camera-guided modality fusion is an effective inductive bias for giving VLMs genuinely spatially grounded intelligence, enabling strong 3D reasoning from RGB-only inputs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

TL;DR: 3D dynamic fire reconstruction from limited views using Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation with hardware synchronization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire reconstruction is challenging due to volatile nature, transparency, and high-frequency features, requiring solutions for under-constrained geometry from only three views

Method: Separate static background from dynamic fire using multi-view stereo + monocular depth priors; initialize fire as 3D flow field from fused optical flow; use 3D Gaussians with lifetime and velocity encoding; employ custom hardware synchronization for temporal alignment

Result: Robust performance demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative validations across diverse real fire scenarios

Conclusion: Successful dynamic fire reconstruction from limited views using Gaussian-based representation and hardware synchronization with affordable commodity hardware

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

TL;DR: RoadSceneBench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning in road scenes, focusing on mid-level semantics like road topology and structural consistency, with a proposed HRRP-T training framework for VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on perception tasks (detection/segmentation) but overlook reasoning capabilities needed to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure, which is essential for autonomous driving and digital map construction.

Method: 1) RoadSceneBench benchmark designed to evaluate visual reasoning in complex road environments, emphasizing relational understanding and structural consistency. 2) HRRP-T (Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency) training framework for VLMs that uses adaptive reward signals to promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. The benchmark provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and structure-aware autonomous perception.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench addresses the gap in reasoning capabilities for road scene understanding, enabling models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images are becoming indistinguishable from authentic ones, threatening social trust and information integrity. Current explainable forensic methods lack verifiable evidence chains, relying on surface-level pattern matching that limits causal explanations and generalization.

Method: REVEAL-Bench benchmark structures data around chain-of-evidence from multiple lightweight expert models with reasoning traces. REVEAL framework uses expert-grounded reinforcement learning with reward mechanism optimizing detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence based on forensic evidence.

Result: REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art for explainable image forensics.

Conclusion: The proposed REVEAL-Bench benchmark and REVEAL framework address critical gaps in AI-generated image detection by providing verifiable evidence chains and causally grounded explanations, advancing the field of explainable image forensics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based person anomaly retrieval approaches rely on complex deep-learning techniques, raising the question of how to optimize models for greater fine-grained features.

Method: 1) Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with Vision-Language Model (VLM) for fine+coarse-grained features; 2) Unified Image-Text (UIT) model with ITC, ITM, MLM, and MIM loss functions; 3) Novel iterative ensemble strategy; 4) Feature selection algorithm guided by LHP model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses fine-grained feature optimization for text-based person anomaly retrieval, demonstrating significant performance improvements through hybrid perspective modeling, multi-loss training, and guided feature selection.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

TL;DR: Frozen DINOv3 foundation model shows strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning, using global low-frequency structures as transferable authenticity cues instead of generator-specific artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods fail on unseen generators because they memorize specific generator artifacts rather than learning transferable authenticity cues. The paper investigates whether foundation models can provide better cross-generator generalization.

Method: Systematically study DINOv3's detection capability through frequency, spatial, and token analysis. Introduce a training-free token-ranking strategy to select authenticity-relevant tokens, followed by a lightweight linear probe for detection.

Result: DINOv3 exhibits strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning, relying on global low-frequency structures. The token-ranking strategy consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Foundation models generalize across diverse generators by using global, low-frequency structures as transferable authenticity cues. The proposed approach provides a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Motivation: Traditional diffusion models transform noise into data, but Bridge Models offer a more efficient data-to-data translation paradigm by directly modeling trajectories between inputs and outputs.

Method: Uses Transformer architecture at scale (20B/1.3B parameters) with variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training of Brownian Bridge Models.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness for image and video translation tasks, highlighting the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.

Conclusion: Scaling Bridge Models with Transformer architecture and specialized training objectives enables efficient data-to-data translation for complex vision tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method estimates aboveground biomass from single RGB images using AGB density maps and synthetic forest data, achieving low error rates on both synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate aboveground biomass estimation is crucial for carbon storage assessment and wildfire fuel load monitoring, but traditional methods are labor-intensive or limited in dense vegetation. There's a need for scalable, cost-effective solutions for forest monitoring.

Method: Proposes a learning-based approach that frames AGB estimation as a dense prediction task using AGB density maps. Uses synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset with realistic forest scenes, tree attributes, and instance masks. Computes AGB via allometric equations and trains a model to predict AGB density maps from single RGB images, integrating them for scene-level AGB estimates.

Result: Achieves median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m² on held-out SPREAD synthetic data and 1.94 kg/m² on real-image dataset. First method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from single RGB images.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective forest monitoring while facilitating broader participation through citizen science initiatives by using only standard RGB cameras.

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing demand for effective research communication through posters, but a lack of understanding about how papers correspond to poster layouts. Existing datasets lack paired annotations at scale for studying this relationship.

Method: Introduces SciPostGen dataset and proposes Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation framework that retrieves layouts consistent with given papers and uses them as guidance for layout generation.

Result: Analysis shows paper structures are associated with number of layout elements in posters. The retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and the framework generates layouts that satisfy given constraints under both constrained and unconstrained conditions.

Conclusion: SciPostGen bridges the gap in understanding paper-to-poster layout relationships and enables effective layout generation that aligns with paper structures while satisfying creator constraints.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

TL;DR: USArt model simultaneously addresses MRI acceleration (up to 5x) and artifact correction (noise/motion) for 2D brain images using dual sub-model approach with gradient under-sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition is time-consuming, especially when multiple sequences or limited patient tolerance. Existing methods either address acceleration (undersampling) OR artifact correction, but not both simultaneously, limiting real-world performance when both degradation factors occur together.

Method: USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model) uses dual sub-model approach customized for 2D brain anatomical images with Cartesian sampling. Explores various under-sampling strategies, with gradient under-sampling yielding best results.

Result: Achieves up to 5x acceleration with simultaneous artifact correction without significant degradation. Shows remarkable increase in SNR and contrast in restored images. Robust in real-world settings with various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels.

Conclusion: USArt successfully addresses the gap in MRI reconstruction by simultaneously handling acceleration and artifact correction, demonstrating practical utility for faster, higher-quality MRI scans in clinical settings.

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses text removal from document images with dense text, creating benchmark data and developing a Bayesian optimization method for flexible mask profile tuning, finding character-wise masks work best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text removal methods focus on simple scene text in outdoor images, but there's little research on complex document images with dense text, which is important for industrial applications.

Method: Created benchmark data for dense text removal, developed a method to model flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization.

Result: Found that text-removal performance is vulnerable to mask profile perturbation, character-wise masks are optimal, and minimum cover of text regions is not optimal.

Conclusion: The research provides a user-friendly guideline for manual masking in practical text-removal tasks, paving the way for better industrial applications.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

TL;DR: LVLMs show promise for autonomous driving safety by processing synchronized driver-facing and road-facing camera inputs, but require fine-tuning for accurate safety-aware instruction generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs focus on road-facing cameras but lack comprehensive safety monitoring that requires synchronized processing of both driver-facing and road-facing views to detect risky behaviors like mobile phone use while driving.

Method: Constructed a dataset and developed models to investigate LVLM capabilities for synchronized multi-view processing, evaluating both pre-trained and fine-tuned LVLMs on this dataset.

Result: Pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, but fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions, though challenges remain in detecting subtle or complex events.

Conclusion: LVLMs show potential for autonomous driving safety applications but require further improvement, particularly for detecting subtle/complex events; findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LVLM-based safety systems.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

TL;DR: Re-MeanFlow enables efficient one-step sampling for flow-based generative models by modeling mean velocity along rectified trajectories with a single reflow step, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based models face challenges: Rectified Flow requires multiple expensive reflow iterations for straight paths, while MeanFlow suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision when trained on curved flows.

Method: Rectified MeanFlow models the mean velocity field along rectified trajectories using only a single reflow step, eliminating need for perfectly straightened paths. Also introduces a truncation heuristic to reduce residual curvature.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Re-MeanFlow provides an effective framework for efficient one-step generation in flow-based models by combining rectified trajectories with mean velocity modeling, achieving better performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

TL;DR: Fast3Dcache is a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion model inference by reusing stable latent features while preserving geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caching methods for 2D/video diffusion models cause geometric artifacts when applied to 3D synthesis due to accumulated numerical errors that disrupt structural consistency.

Method: Introduces Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically allocate cache quotas based on voxel stabilization patterns, and Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features using velocity magnitude and acceleration metrics.

Result: Achieves up to 27.12% speed-up and 54.8% reduction in FLOPs with minimal quality degradation: 2.48% increase in Chamfer Distance and 1.95% decrease in F-Score.

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache enables efficient 3D diffusion inference without training while maintaining geometric fidelity, addressing the computational bottleneck of iterative denoising in 3D generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

TL;DR: Diff-ICMH is a generative image compression framework that harmonizes machine analysis and human perception by preserving semantic information for intelligent tasks while ensuring perceptual realism through generative priors and semantic consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image compression methods are optimized separately for either human perception or machine analysis tasks, missing the fundamental commonality that preserving accurate semantic information benefits both objectives - it's critical for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding.

Method: Proposes Diff-ICMH framework that leverages generative priors for perceptual realism, incorporates Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) to guarantee semantic fidelity, and introduces Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that uses image-level tags to stimulate diffusion model capabilities with minimal bit rate overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without task-specific adaptation, while maintaining high-quality visual experience for human perception.

Conclusion: The framework successfully harmonizes machine and human vision in image compression, supporting multiple intelligent tasks simultaneously while preserving visual appeal, representing an advancement in unified compression approaches.

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars from a single portrait across head, half-body, and full-body inputs. Our method tackles three bottlenecks: pose- and framing-sensitive feature representations, limited scalable data, and unreliable proxy-mesh estimation. We introduce a Dual-UV representation that maps image features to a canonical UV space via Core-UV and Shell-UV branches, eliminating pose- and framing-induced token shifts. We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency. A robust proxy-mesh tracker maintains stability under partial visibility. Together, these components enable strong in-the-wild generalization. Trained only on half-body synthetic data, our model achieves state-of-the-art head and upper-body reconstruction and competitive full-body results. Extensive experiments and analyses further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: TCEAD: Text condition embedded framework for automated dental implant abutment design using text-guided localization and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dental implant abutment design is time-consuming and error-prone; inappropriate designs can cause peri-implantitis complications. AI-assisted design can improve efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Extends MeshMAE self-supervised learning with text-guided localization module using CLIP text encoder. Pre-trains encoder on oral scan data for fine-grained feature extraction, enabling precise abutment area localization.

Result: Achieves 0.8%-12.85% IoU improvement over mainstream methods on large abutment design dataset, demonstrating superior performance in automated abutment design.

Conclusion: TCEAD framework effectively automates dental abutment design with improved accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application to reduce manual labor and improve design quality.

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

*Dayou Huang,Feng Xue,Xurui Li,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoRefiner improves zero-shot industrial anomaly detection by refining patch-level anomaly maps to pixel-level using anomaly score maps, achieving up to 5.2% gain in pixel-AP metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods produce coarse anomaly maps due to patch-level ViT features. Recent attempts to predict finer anomalies struggle with missed detections due to the gap between synthetic training anomalies and real ones. The authors observed that anomaly score maps provide complementary spatial cues missing from ZSAD's image features.

Method: Proposes AnoRefiner with two key components: 1) Anomaly Refinement Decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing reliance on synthetic anomaly data. 2) Progressive Group-wise Test-time Training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for refinement in the next group, compatible with any ZSAD method.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets show AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to 5.2% gain in pixel-AP metrics, with improvements directly observable in visualizations.

Conclusion: AnoRefiner effectively bridges the gap between patch-level and pixel-level anomaly detection by leveraging anomaly score maps as complementary spatial cues, achieving significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing ZSAD methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

TL;DR: A latent drift-guided replay method for continual learning in medical imaging that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new hospital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting severely limits AI deployment in medical imaging where models must continually adapt to new hospital data without losing established diagnostic knowledge. Current methods fail to maintain performance on previously learned tasks when sequentially trained on new data.

Method: Introduces a latent drift-guided replay method that quantifies representational instability via latent drift (change in sample's internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation). Aggregates drift at patient level and stores per-patient slices with greatest multi-layer representation shift in memory buffer for replay.

Result: Evaluated on cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, the method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay baselines.

Conclusion: Latent drift serves as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real-world medical settings, enabling models to adapt to new hospital data while preserving diagnostic knowledge.

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

TL;DR: ReasonEdit framework enhances image editing by incorporating MLLM reasoning capabilities through thinking and reflection mechanisms in a loop, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models freeze MLLM encoders during training, limiting their reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to unlock MLLM's reasoning power to improve instruction understanding and editing accuracy.

Method: Proposes a thinking-editing-reflection loop: thinking interprets abstract instructions using MLLM world knowledge, reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies stopping points.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains: ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), Kris (+8.2%) with Step1X-Edit initialization; outperforms previous open-source methods on GEdit and Kris with Qwen-Image-Edit integration.

Conclusion: Unlocking MLLM reasoning capabilities through thinking and reflection mechanisms significantly advances image editing performance, demonstrating the value of incorporating reasoning loops into editing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Motivation: Current remote sensing MLLMs rely on expensive, human-curated chain-of-thought data that introduces biases and limits reasoning diversity. The authors aim to develop a framework that enables geospatial reasoning without such supervision.

Method: Proposes GeoZero framework with two datasets: GeoZero-Instruct for supervised fine-tuning to acquire geospatial knowledge, and GeoZero-Hard for deep reasoning in reinforcement learning. Introduces Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A²GRPO) that regularizes reasoning processes using the model's own answers to encourage diverse yet accurate thinking.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks show GeoZero surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods and fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Conclusion: GeoZero successfully enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without predefined CoT supervision, reducing annotation costs and human biases while promoting diverse reasoning. The framework demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks and enables emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss to mitigate task conflicts in unified multimodal models without model decoupling, improving both generation and understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models face conflicting targets between understanding and generation tasks. While model decoupling (e.g., double encoders, MOE/MOT) helps alleviate conflicts, it sacrifices interleave generation ability and undermines the unified model's original intent.

Method: Analyzes cross-modal attention behavior to understand why decoupling works, then proposes Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss that explicitly learns task-specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. Applied to Emu3 and Janus-Pro models during SFT and post-training stages.

Result: AIA loss refines cross-modal attention patterns and boosts both generation and understanding performance without requiring model decoupling or architectural changes.

Conclusion: AIA loss provides an effective alternative to model decoupling for mitigating task conflicts in unified multimodal models, preserving interleave generation ability while improving overall performance.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

Motivation: Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods use fixed, shared prompts with deterministic parameters, which cannot capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains, limiting adaptation to downstream tasks with limited supervision.

Method: Proposes Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from learned posterior distribution, introduces class-aware prior from instance representation and class prototype, and formulates prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations trained end-to-end through reparameterized sampling.

Result: Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure.

Conclusion: VaMP effectively addresses limitations of existing prompt learning methods by enabling sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning, leading to improved adaptation to downstream tasks with limited supervision through variational inference approach.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Method: Decompose DMD training objective, identify CFG Augmentation as core engine, Distribution Matching as regularizer; validate with alternative regularizers; propose decoupled noise schedules.

Result: CFG Augmentation drives few-step distillation, DM term stabilizes training; simpler constraints can replace DM; decoupled schedules improve performance; adopted by Z-Image project.

Conclusion: Distribution matching is not the primary driver of DMD distillation - CFG Augmentation is the core engine, enabling principled modifications and better understanding of distillation mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

*Yiwen Zhang,Joseph Tung,Ruojin Cai,David Fouhey,Hadar Averbuch-Elor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D foundation models show emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, and a lightweight alignment scheme improves their pose estimation without degrading other capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore 3D foundation models' ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views and enhance their capabilities for such challenging conditions.

Method: Study internal representations of 3DFMs, then introduce lightweight alignment scheme that refines internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms while keeping decoder heads frozen.

Result: Targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Also introduces MegaUnScene benchmark for testing on unseen Internet scenes.

Conclusion: 3DFMs exhibit emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, and lightweight alignment can enhance these capabilities while maintaining other performance aspects, with new benchmark provided for future research.

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. All code and data will be released.

TL;DR: Ar2Can is a two-stage framework for generating multi-human scenes that separates spatial layout planning from identity rendering to solve problems like face duplication and identity merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals, creating unrealistic group images.

Method: Two-stage framework: Architect module predicts structured layouts specifying person locations, then Artist module synthesizes images using spatially-grounded face matching reward (Hungarian spatial alignment + ArcFace identity similarity). Uses GRPO optimization with compositional rewards.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in count accuracy and identity preservation on MultiHuman-Testbench while maintaining high perceptual quality, using primarily synthetic data without real multi-human images.

Conclusion: Ar2Can successfully disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation, solving key limitations of existing models through structured layout prediction and spatially-grounded identity preservation.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

TL;DR: Z-Image is a 6B-parameter open-source image generation model that challenges massive-scale models with efficient training and inference, achieving SOTA results with 314K GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-performance image generation is dominated by proprietary systems, while open-source alternatives have massive parameter counts (20B-80B) making them impractical for inference and fine-tuning on consumer hardware.

Method: Proposes Z-Image built on Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture with systematic lifecycle optimization, including curated data infrastructure, streamlined training curriculum, and few-step distillation with reward post-training to create Z-Image-Turbo.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or surpassing leading competitors across various dimensions, with exceptional photorealistic generation and bilingual text rendering, while enabling sub-second inference on H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer hardware (<16GB VRAM).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead, challenging the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm, and releases code/weights/demo to foster accessible, budget-friendly generative models.

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Splat-SAP: A feed-forward method for novel view synthesis of human-centered scenes from sparse binocular cameras using Gaussian Splatting with point map geometry representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense input views or largely overlapped views for geometry priors, limiting their application to sparse binocular camera setups common in human-centered scenes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Transform point maps to real space via iterative affinity learning for camera control; 2) Project binocular point maps to target view, refine via stereo matching, and anchor Gaussian primitives for rendering.

Result: The method improves both stability of point map reconstruction and visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering on collected multi-view human-centered data.

Conclusion: Splat-SAP enables feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering from sparse binocular cameras by leveraging robust point map geometry representation and a two-stage learning strategy.

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

TL;DR: Combining visible and thermal infrared aerial imagery with YOLO11n model improves great blue heron detection, with late fusion achieving 93% F1 score for occupied nests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient wildlife monitoring methods for biodiversity conservation; combining VIS and TIR imagery can provide complementary information to improve automated detection compared to single-source approaches.

Method: Used synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery with YOLO11n model; tested two fusion approaches: early fusion (PCA-based) and late fusion (CART-based); automatically aligned images using deep learning; focused on great blue heron case study.

Result: Both fusion methods improved F1 scores over VIS-only model; late fusion achieved 93.0% F1 score for occupied nests (vs 90.2% VIS-only); identified false positives with 90% recall; TIR FOV and alignment constraints limited data availability.

Conclusion: VIS-TIR fusion improves detection accuracy but has practical limitations; very high-resolution visible sensors may be more operational for surveys despite fusion benefits.

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

TL;DR: Proposed a hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer model with BiLSTM for temporal analysis to predict MCI progression to Alzheimer's using longitudinal MRI and biomarkers, achieving 95.05% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is critical since it's irreversible. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage, but predicting which MCI patients will progress to AD (pMCI vs sMCI) remains challenging.

Method: Hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer architecture captures local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from MRI scans. BiLSTM networks process features from four consecutive MRI timepoints plus non-image biomarkers to predict cognitive status at 48 months.

Result: Achieved 95.05% average progression prediction accuracy between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining spatial and temporal modeling is effective for early Alzheimer's detection, showing superior performance in predicting MCI progression using longitudinal neuroimaging data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with culture mixing scenarios where multiple cultural elements appear together, showing background reliance and inconsistent predictions across contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In our globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together in visual scenes, but how Large Vision-Language Models perceive these culture mixing scenarios remains underexplored.

Method: Constructed CultureMix, a food VQA benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks. Evaluated 10 LVLMs and explored three robustness strategies including supervised fine-tuning.

Result: LVLMs consistently fail to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings, show strong background reliance (accuracy drops 14% when backgrounds are added), and produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across contexts.

Conclusion: Supervised fine-tuning with diverse culture mixing datasets improves model consistency and reduces background sensitivity. Culture mixing scenarios need increased attention for developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: CogIP-Bench benchmark reveals MLLMs struggle with subjective image properties (memorability, aesthetics, emotion), but post-training can align them with human perception and improve creative tasks like image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs can identify objects and describe scenes but lack understanding of subjective cognitive properties like what makes images memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative to humans.

Method: Introduce CogIP-Bench benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on image cognitive properties, then use post-training phase to enhance model alignment with human judgments, and demonstrate transferability to downstream creative tasks through image generation pipeline integration.

Result: Current models show poor alignment with human perception of nuanced image properties, but post-training effectively bridges this gap. The learned cognitive alignment is transferable and can guide image synthesis to produce images with desired traits like memorability and visual appeal.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark for measuring human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and demonstrates that cognitive alignment enables more human-centric AI applications in creative domains.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely, accurate land-cover maps are critical for environmental applications, but remote sensing classification faces challenges with scarce/imbalanced annotations and geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes.

Method: Proposes LC4-DViT framework with two components: 1) text-guided diffusion pipeline using GPT-4o-generated descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to create balanced training data, and 2) DViT architecture combining DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with Vision Transformer encoder to capture both fine-scale geometry and global context.

Result: Achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen's Kappa on AID dataset (8 classes), outperforming ViT baseline and other models. Shows good transferability on SIRI-WHU subset (0.9333 OA). GPT-4o evaluation confirms DViT's attention aligns with hydrologically meaningful structures.

Conclusion: Description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping, addressing annotation scarcity and geometric distortion challenges.

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

TL;DR: Captain Safari introduces a pose-conditioned world engine that generates 3D-consistent videos by retrieving from persistent world memory, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging camera trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world engines struggle with aggressive 6-DoF camera trajectories and complex outdoor scenes, losing geometric coherence, deviating from target paths, or being overly conservative in motion.

Method: Uses pose-conditioned world memory with a retriever that fetches pose-aligned world tokens from dynamic local memory to condition video generation along camera trajectories.

Result: Substantially outperforms SOTA on video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following metrics (reduces MEt3R, improves AUC@30, lower FVD), wins 67.6% preferences in human study.

Conclusion: Pose-conditioned world memory is effective for long-horizon controllable video generation, and OpenSafari dataset provides a challenging benchmark for future world-engine research.

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

Motivation: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), it's unclear whether they are robust to contradicting modalities. The paper aims to rigorously study this fundamental question by introducing MMA-Bench to probe model reliance on specific modalities.

Method: Introduces MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks to probe modality reliance. Uses black-box and white-box interpretability techniques to analyze MLLM brittleness. Proposes a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach models when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. The proposed alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding through extensive experiments and analysis.

TL;DR: RETINA benchmark addresses visual shortcut problem in MKB-VQA by using images of related entities instead of primary subjects, and MIMIR model improves performance by using multiple related entity images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MKB-VQA benchmarks have "visual shortcuts" where query images match primary document entities, allowing models to exploit visual cues alone without understanding relationships.

Method: 1) Created RETINA benchmark using LLM-driven pipeline with 120k training and 2k human-curated test queries referencing secondary subjects paired with related entity images. 2) Proposed MIMIR model that enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities.

Result: Existing models show significantly degraded performance on RETINA, confirming their reliance on visual shortcuts. MIMIR effectively handles RETINA challenges unlike prior single-image approaches.

Conclusion: RETINA exposes limitations of current MKB-VQA benchmarks, and MIMIR's multi-image approach provides effective solution for relational entity understanding without visual shortcuts.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: SLEUTH is a multi-agent framework that improves VLMs' performance on long documents by filtering redundancy and identifying key multimodal evidence through hierarchical refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs perform well on single-page tasks but struggle with long documents where clues are scattered across pages/modalities and redundancy impairs judgment. Existing retrieval methods still contain substantial redundancy.

Method: SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse-to-fine process: identifies key textual/visual clues, filters salient visual evidence (tables/charts), analyzes queries to devise reasoning strategies, and synthesizes distilled, evidence-dense multimodal context.

Result: When paired with advanced VLM backbones, SLEUTH consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies verify each module's effectiveness and confirm benefits of hierarchical refinement.

Conclusion: SLEUTH is a model-agnostic, scalable framework that addresses VLMs' limitations on long documents through multi-agent collaboration and hierarchical refinement, enabling better document understanding by reducing redundancy and focusing on key evidence.

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

*Jiaye Wu,Saeed Hadadan,Geng Lin,Peihan Tu,Matthias Zwicker,David Jacobs,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOW: A global illumination-aware inverse rendering framework that handles complex lighting challenges in indoor scenes, especially for co-located light-camera setups, achieving superior material reflectance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes suffers from ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, especially with inter-reflections. While co-located light-camera setups help with lighting calibration, they introduce new challenges like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights that existing methods can't handle.

Method: GLOW integrates neural implicit surface representation with neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination. It jointly optimizes geometry and reflectance using carefully designed regularization and initialization. Includes dynamic radiance cache for sharp lighting discontinuities and surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts.

Result: GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination conditions.

Conclusion: GLOW effectively addresses the complex challenges of indoor scene inverse rendering, particularly for co-located light-camera setups, by incorporating global illumination awareness and specialized techniques for handling near-field lighting and specular artifacts.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

*Fengyi Fang,Sicheng Yang,Wenming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoordSpeaker enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis by bridging semantic gaps through gesture captioning and using a conditional latent diffusion model for multimodal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-speech gesture generation methods are limited because they omit text-driven non-spontaneous gestures and face two key challenges: 1) semantic prior gap due to lack of descriptive text annotations in datasets, and 2) difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation.

Method: 1) Novel gesture captioning framework using motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities; 2) Conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and hierarchically controlled denoiser for coordinated gesture generation.

Result: Produces high-quality gestures that are rhythmically synchronized with speech and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker pioneers gesture understanding and captioning to tackle semantic gaps in gesture generation while offering novel bidirectional gesture-text mapping, enabling comprehensive coordinated co-speech gesture synthesis.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework classifies pedestrian age/gender from intersection footage using CNNs, achieving 86% accuracy for real-time demographic monitoring without facial recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian safety is critical in congested urban intersections, especially in low/middle-income countries with multimodal traffic. Current systems lack demographic data (age/gender) that influences vulnerability, creating a gap in real-time monitoring capabilities.

Method: Proposed deep learning framework using CNNs to classify pedestrian age group (adult, teenager, child) and gender (male/female) as unified six-class problem from far-view intersection footage. Used ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet) and custom lightweight CNN architectures. Collected video data from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Tested eight model variants with different pooling strategies and optimizers.

Result: ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved highest accuracy (86.19%). Custom lightweight CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. Both models enable real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, cost-effective demographic monitoring using existing camera infrastructure. Outputs can inform intersection design, signal timing optimization, and targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups. Offers demographic insights missing in conventional traffic data for more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

TL;DR: ClearGCD addresses prototype confusion in Generalized Category Discovery by using Semantic View Alignment and Shortcut Suppression Regularization to reduce reliance on non-semantic cues, improving performance on known and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes in open-world scenarios.

Method: Two complementary mechanisms: 1) Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations; 2) Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones.

Result: ClearGCD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches.

Conclusion: ClearGCD effectively mitigates prototype confusion in GCD by reducing reliance on non-semantic cues through its dual mechanisms, improving both generalization and preservation of known class knowledge.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DM³T: A diffusion-inspired multimodal fusion framework for MOT that iteratively aligns visible and thermal infrared features through cross-modal diffusion fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VT-MOT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal MOT integrating visible light and thermal infrared is essential for robust autonomous driving, but existing fusion methods (concatenation/addition) fail to bridge the non-linear distribution gap between modalities, causing modality conflicts and degraded tracking accuracy.

Method: Proposes DM³T framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as iterative feature alignment using Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module for mutual guidance between modalities, plus Diffusion Refiner (DR) for feature enhancement and Hierarchical Tracker for adaptive confidence estimation.

Result: Achieves 41.7 HOTA on VT-MOT benchmark, representing 1.54% relative improvement over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior multimodal fusion and tracking performance.

Conclusion: DM³T effectively addresses modality conflicts through diffusion-inspired iterative alignment, providing a comprehensive online tracking framework that unifies detection, estimation, and association without complex post-processing.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2C reframes multimodal prompt learning as dynamic denoising, replacing static point representations with semantic clouds for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal prompt learning methods are limited by optimizing single static point representations, which are brittle, cause overfitting on base classes, and generalize poorly to novel/ambiguous categories.

Method: Introduces Points-to-Clouds (P2C) framework inspired by diffusion models, featuring dual denoising: Dynamic Prompt Denoising perturbs text prompts with annealed noise, and V-L Mapper denoising loss reconstructs clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 datasets show P2C consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 79.7% Harmonic Mean on base-to-novel generalization benchmark (1.4% relative improvement over baseline).

Conclusion: Learning semantic clouds rather than static points enables more robust generalization in multimodal prompt learning, with P2C demonstrating superior performance through its diffusion-inspired denoising approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

Motivation: Existing methods treat text queries and video clips as black-boxes, overlooking the importance of individual words, which hinders contextual understanding in video moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks.

Method: Integrates image-text scene understanding via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), introduces a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from queries, and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on word relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables fine-grained clip filtering by prioritizing important words in queries, enhancing semantic understanding of video clips through MLLM integration and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods mainly use only geometric information, while recent RGB-D registration methods focus on feature fusion or improved feature learning, limiting their ability to fully exploit image information and practical applicability.

Method: ViGG uses a mutual guidance strategy: 1) geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques in visual-geometric combination form, and 2) visual-guided geometric matching that uses visual priors to determine search space for extracting high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences.

Result: Experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and KITTI datasets show ViGG outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

Conclusion: The mutual guidance strategy provides superior robustness, making ViGG applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

TL;DR: VLMs can recognize content and emotions in artworks but struggle with abstract/symbolic images and show inconsistency in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well current vision language models can detect and analyze emotional expression in artworks, given the abstract and historically changing nature of emotion realization in art.

Method: Case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) using four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) with qualitative expert evaluation.

Result: VLMs recognize image content surprisingly well and often identify depicted emotions and their expression. Performance is best for concrete images but fails for highly abstract or symbolic images. Reliable symbol recognition remains difficult, and models show inconsistency in answering related questions.

Conclusion: Current VLMs show promising capabilities in analyzing emotional content in artworks but have limitations with abstraction, symbolism, and consistency, highlighting areas for future improvement in art historical analysis.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuMatC is a neural framework that learns low-rank continuous mappings for parametric matrix operations, achieving 3-10× speedup over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional matrix operations (inversion, SVD) treat each parametric instance independently, ignoring inherent low-rankness and continuity across parameters, leading to redundant computations in applications like wireless communication.

Method: Unsupervised learning of low-rank continuous mapping from parameters to matrix operation results using neural networks; trained model enables efficient computation at arbitrary parameters with minimal operations.

Result: 3× speedup for parametric inversion and 10× speedup for parametric SVD compared to NumPy baseline in wireless communication applications, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: NeuMatC effectively exploits parameter-space continuity and low-rankness to dramatically accelerate parametric matrix operations, offering practical benefits for real-time applications.

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Method: Proposes ReImage, a neural watermarking-based framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark, with a generator optimized for neural watermarking and an image enhancement module to refine recovered images.

Result: ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of shuffled watermarking for self-recovery, with code and pretrained models to be released upon publication.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

*Yongsen Cheng,Yuanhao Cai,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenoiseGS is a novel burst denoising framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves 250× faster inference than NeRF-based methods while handling large motion and preserving fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing burst denoising methods struggle with large motion or have prohibitive computational costs, creating a need for more efficient and effective solutions that can handle noisy inputs while preserving image quality.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising with two key innovations: 1) Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss that regularizes geometry from noisy inputs using high-quality Gaussian point clouds generated from clean inputs, and 2) log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss that adaptively weights frequency discrepancies to preserve fine-grained details.

Result: Significantly exceeds state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving 250× faster inference speed.

Conclusion: DenoiseGS demonstrates that 3D Gaussian Splatting can be effectively adapted for burst denoising, offering superior performance and dramatically faster inference compared to previous approaches, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

*Shijun Shi,Jing Xu,Zhihang Li,Chunli Peng,Xiaoda Yang,Lijing Lu,Kai Hu,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One-to-All Animation is a unified framework for character animation and pose transfer that handles spatially misaligned references with arbitrary layouts through self-supervised outpainting and comprehensive identity feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based character animation methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures, leaving the problem of reference-pose misalignment unsolved.

Method: 1) Reformulate training as self-supervised outpainting to transform diverse-layout references into unified occluded-input format; 2) Design reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction; 3) Integrate hybrid reference fusion attention for varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths; 4) Introduce identity-robust pose control to decouple appearance from skeletal structure; 5) Use token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the method outperforms existing approaches in character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts.

Conclusion: One-to-All Animation provides a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and pose transfer that successfully handles spatially misaligned references, addressing a key limitation in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.

### [153] [Do We Need Perfect Data? Leveraging Noise for Domain Generalized Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22948)
*Taeyeong Kim,SeungJoon Lee,Jung Uk Kim,MyeongAh Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLEX-Seg transforms diffusion-based data generation misalignment into a learning opportunity for domain generalization in semantic segmentation, achieving SOTA results on adverse condition datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in semantic segmentation, especially under adverse conditions, pose challenges. Diffusion-based data generation methods create misalignment between generated images and semantic masks, which existing methods try to fix. FLEX-Seg aims to leverage this misalignment rather than correct it.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes capturing boundary characteristics across scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis dynamically adjusting learning based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling progressively focusing on challenging examples.

Result: Consistent improvements across five real-world datasets, with 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment enables learning robust representations while capturing stylistic variations.

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

*Shiyu Shen,Zhe Gao,Taifeng Chai,Yang Huang,Bin Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SolarCHIP: Contrastive pretrained vision backbones for SDO solar imaging that address multimodal sensing, weak class separability, and strong intra-class variability through multi-granularity contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most solar image analysis approaches either train task-specific encoders from scratch or use natural-image pretraining that ignores unique characteristics of SDO data, failing to address multimodal sensing across AIA/HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals.

Method: Multi-granularity contrastive pretraining framework that jointly aligns: (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs for temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices for position-consistent modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. Trained both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal translation (HMI↔AIA via ControlNet) and full-disk flare classification, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities.

Conclusion: SolarCHIP provides the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications. Pretrained weights and training code are publicly released.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

### [155] [HMR3D: Hierarchical Multimodal Representation for 3D Scene Understanding with Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22961)
*Chen Li,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs using multi-view images and text descriptions with spatial coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based 3D scene understanding approaches use implicit alignment of 3D features with VLM embedding space, leading to suboptimal performance due to 3D data scarcity and complex spatial relationships.

Method: Hierarchical multimodal representation that explicitly aligns with VLMs at input space using multi-view images (top-down + four directional views) and text descriptions with 3D object coordinates. Hierarchical feature aggregation from patch-level to view-level to scene-level representations.

Result: Experimental results show effectiveness on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed explicit alignment approach with hierarchical multimodal representation improves 3D scene reasoning by better capturing spatial relationships and enabling both local and global context reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Yurong Qian,Zhenhong Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic SLAM framework with illumination invariance using proactive intrinsic appearance normalization and reactive dynamic radiance balancing for extreme exposure conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme exposure degrades both 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled SLAM systems that need illumination invariance.

Method: Two key designs: 1) Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module that proactively disentangles scene's intrinsic properties from transient lighting, learning a standardized illumination-invariant appearance model; 2) Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) that reactively handles extreme exposure frames by activating only when exposure is poor and operating directly on the radiance field.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on public datasets in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy, demonstrating unprecedented robustness to extreme lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction creates a semantic SLAM framework with exceptional robustness to extreme exposure conditions while maintaining performance under normal lighting.

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

*Zeyu Zhang,Shuning Chang,Yuanyu He,Yizeng Han,Jiasheng Tang,Fan Wang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlockVid is a novel block diffusion framework for generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos, addressing KV-cache error accumulation and lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks through semantic-aware sparse KV cache, Block Forcing training, and dedicated noise scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating minute-long videos is crucial for developing world models and AI simulators, but current semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) approaches face two main challenges: KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks with coherence-aware metrics.

Method: Proposes BlockVid framework with: 1) semantic-aware sparse KV cache to reduce error propagation, 2) Block Forcing training strategy, 3) chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling for enhanced temporal consistency. Also introduces LV-Bench, a new fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos with coherence-aware metrics.

Result: BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods on both VBench and LV-Bench, achieving 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: BlockVid effectively addresses key limitations in long-video generation through its novel architectural components and training strategies, demonstrating superior performance in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos, advancing toward realistic world models and AI simulators.

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

### [158] [McSc: Motion-Corrective Preference Alignment for Video Generation with Self-Critic Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22974)
*Qiushi Yang,Yingjie Chen,Yuan Yao,Yifang Men,Huaizhuo Liu,Miaomiao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: McSc is a three-stage RL framework for text-to-video preference alignment that addresses bias toward low-motion content through dimensional reasoning and motion-corrective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or proxy metrics that lack understanding of human preference logic, and they often ignore conflicting dimensions like motion vs. quality, leading to bias toward low-motion content.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning trains generative reward model to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments; 2) Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning enables structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical supervision; 3) Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization dynamically re-weights alignment objectives to mitigate low-motion bias.

Result: McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed McSc framework effectively addresses preference alignment challenges in T2V generation by modeling nuanced human preferences through dimensional reasoning and correcting motion bias, resulting in better-aligned and more dynamic video generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

*Hong Zheng,Nan Mu,Han Su,Lin Feng,Xiaoning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF) - a low-amplitude pass filter to reduce noise in convolutional features for segmentation networks, validated on cardiac MR datasets with information entropy analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise reduction in convolutional features is often neglected in segmentation networks, potentially causing butterfly effects that impair downstream results in the feature system.

Method: Treats convolutional features as Gaussian-distributed feature signal matrices and introduces CFF - a simple low-amplitude pass filter to minimize noise in feature inputs.

Result: Experiments on two 2D segmentation networks and two cardiac MR datasets show noise reduction in feature signal matrices, quantified using a binarization equation for information entropy calculation.

Conclusion: CFF effectively reduces noise in convolutional features for segmentation networks, with measurable improvements demonstrated through information entropy analysis on medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

TL;DR: MultiBanana is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-reference text-to-image generation models, covering diverse challenges like varying reference counts, domain mismatches, scale issues, rare concepts, and multilingual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for text-to-image generation focus on single or few reference images, lacking comprehensive evaluation of multi-reference capabilities and failing to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings.

Method: Introduces MultiBanana benchmark with carefully designed test cases covering: (1) varying number of references, (2) domain mismatches among references, (3) scale mismatches between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts, and (5) multilingual textual references.

Result: Analysis of various text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement in multi-reference generation tasks.

Conclusion: MultiBanana provides a standardized benchmark for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation, pushing boundaries and establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for the field.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive models to achieve classifier-free guidance without retraining, conditions, or architectural changes by selectively retaining spectral information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is widely used but tied to diffusion model assumptions; need for similar guidance in autoregressive models without structural constraints.

Method: Constructs controllable weak model in spectral domain using invertible transformations, performs spectrum selection along channel dimension, and introduces spectrum renormalization for stability.

Result: Enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation in both discrete and continuous AR models with text/class conditioning.

Conclusion: Spectrum-weakening framework provides effective classifier-free guidance for autoregressive models, overcoming diffusion model constraints through spectral domain manipulation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based editing models face two critical challenges: (1) instruction hallucination where text-only reasoning leads to factual errors due to information bottlenecks, and (2) reward hacking where agents exploit flaws in static reward models during dynamic policy optimization.

Method: JarvisEvo emulates expert human designers through iterative editing with three key innovations: (1) interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning for better instruction following, (2) synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) for self-improvement without external rewards, and (3) seamless Adobe Lightroom integration for global and local fine-grained editing.

Result: On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, with a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo successfully addresses the limitations of existing agent-based editing models through its multimodal reasoning approach and self-improvement optimization framework, demonstrating significant advancements in editing quality and factual accuracy.

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom.

*Yiwei Li,Jiannong Cao,Penghui Ruan,Divya Saxena,Songye Zhu,Yinfeng Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GC-4DGS improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view rendering by integrating geometric consistency priors from MVS and monocular depth, achieving better quality than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods degrade significantly with sparse input views, limiting practical AIoT applications like digital twins. The core problem is incoherent learning of 4D geometry when input views decrease.

Method: Introduces GC-4DGS framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4DGS. Uses dynamic consistency checking to reduce MVS uncertainties across spacetime, and global-local depth regularization to distill consistent geometry from monocular depths for coherent 4D volume learning.

Result: Outperforms RF-DeRF (latest dynamic radiance field for sparse inputs) by 2.62dB and original 4DGS by 1.58dB in PSNR on N3DV and Technicolor datasets, while maintaining real-time rendering and deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Conclusion: GC-4DGS successfully addresses sparse-view degradation in dynamic Gaussian Splatting through geometric consistency integration, enabling high-quality real-time dynamic scene rendering for practical AIoT applications like digital twins.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

*Hyunjin Kim,Kunho Kim,Adam Lee,Wonkwang Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex is a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates complete textures for both exterior and interior surfaces using occlusion-aware visibility layers and soft UV-space blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D texturing methods fail to handle occluded interior surfaces, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. There's a need for methods that can texture both visible and hidden regions of 3D meshes.

Method: Uses occlusion-aware framework with hit levels from multi-view ray casting to partition mesh faces into visibility layers. Applies two-stage visibility control: first reveals interior regions with structural coherence, then textures each layer using pretrained diffusion model. Uses soft UV-space blending to seamlessly merge textures across layers based on view-dependent visibility confidence.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Operates without costly fine-tuning of pretrained diffusion models and allows separate prompting for exterior/interior regions.

Conclusion: GOATex successfully addresses the limitation of incomplete interior texturing in 3D meshes through an occlusion-aware framework with visibility layers and soft blending, enabling complete, high-quality texturing of both exterior and interior surfaces.

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

*Grigorios Aris Cheimariotis,Antonis Karakottas,Vangelis Chatzis,Angelos Kanlis,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to quantify individual image contributions to NeRF-based 3D reconstructions using reconstruction quality metrics (PSNR/MSE), validated by removing low-contributing images during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data valuation is important for XR and digital media, but in-the-wild image sets for 3D scene reconstruction have varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. Need to quantify each image's contribution to NeRF reconstructions.

Method: Proposes a method to assess individual image contributions to NeRF-based reconstructions using reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. Validates approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Method successfully quantifies image contributions, allowing identification of low-contributing images that can be removed without significantly impacting reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Provides a practical approach for data valuation in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, enabling more efficient training by focusing on high-contributing images and potentially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

*Hongye Zhu,Xuan Liu,Yanwen Ba,Jingye Xue,Shigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REP (REplay Prompting) is a lightweight method that uses residual feature buffers to replay early-layer representations in deeper layers, improving multimodal model robustness to missing modalities with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities cause significant performance drops in multimodal models. Existing methods either synthesize missing modalities (computationally expensive) or use prompt-based fine-tuning that only uses adjacent-layer features, missing long-distance contextual information that could help tolerate missing modalities.

Method: REP has three key components: (1) modality-wise feature buffers via residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, (2) private-shared feature decoupling where private buffers keep modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics, and (3) task-aware dynamic initialization to configure buffers differently for better stability and generalization under various missing-modality conditions.

Result: Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks show REP consistently outperforms prior methods in both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, with only negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: REP establishes a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments, offering better performance than existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENSEL is an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system that improves diagnostic accuracy for atopic dermatitis by integrating multiple deep learning models, achieving high recall and fast processing speeds using real-world clinical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital healthcare growth in South Korea, lack of objective diagnostic methods for atopic dermatitis (similar to psoriasis), existing studies use high-quality images not available in clinical settings, and need for both accuracy and fast response times.

Method: Proposed ENSEL system using ensemble learning approach that integrates various deep learning models to enhance diagnostic accuracy, tested with actual user-taken skin lesion images in real clinical settings.

Result: ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and processing speed of less than 1 second, demonstrating both accuracy and fast response time using randomly sampled skin disease images.

Conclusion: ENSEL contributes to objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes advancement of digital healthcare by providing accurate, fast diagnostic support using real-world clinical images.

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

TL;DR: NumeriKontrol enables precise image editing using continuous numeric scales with units, allowing fine-grained control over edit intensity through a plug-and-play numeric adapter for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text instructions alone lack precision for fine-grained control over edit intensity in image editing, requiring a more precise method for adjusting image attributes.

Method: Introduces NumeriKontrol framework with a Numeric Adapter that encodes numeric editing scales and injects them into diffusion models. Uses task-separated design for zero-shot multi-condition editing and synthesizes training data from reliable sources (rendering engines, DSLR cameras) with the Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset.

Result: NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across diverse attribute editing scenarios, functioning as a powerful interactive editing studio.

Conclusion: The framework advances instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation through numeric scale control.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

*Yuandong Wang,Yao Cui,Yuxin Zhao,Zhen Yang,Yangfu Zhu,Zhenzhou Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MathSight is a university-level multimodal math reasoning benchmark that isolates visual contribution by testing VLMs on problems with different visual variants (original, hand-drawn, photo) vs. text-only, finding visual input's value decreases with problem difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks don't isolate how much visual information actually contributes to mathematical reasoning, making it unclear whether models genuinely use visual understanding or just rely on linguistic priors.

Method: Created MathSight benchmark with university-level math problems, each having multiple visual variants (original, hand-drawn, photo-captured) and a text-only condition for controlled comparison of visual contribution.

Result: Visual information's contribution diminishes with increasing problem difficulty; Qwen3-VL without images outperforms both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, showing current VLMs don't effectively use visual input for reasoning.

Conclusion: Benchmarks like MathSight are needed to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning, as current VLMs rely more on linguistic priors than visual understanding for complex mathematical problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: db-SP is a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that addresses workload imbalance in Diffusion Transformers using dual-level partitioning and dynamic parallel degree selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling Diffusion Transformer inference via sequence parallelism is hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models with block-wise sparse attention, due to varying sparsity across attention heads and irregular dense block distribution.

Method: Proposes db-SP with: 1) formal sparse imbalance ratio to quantify imbalance, 2) dual-level partitioning for near-perfect workload balance at head and block levels, and 3) dynamic parallel degree selection for evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers.

Result: Achieves 1.25x end-to-end speedup and 1.40x attention-specific speedup over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Conclusion: db-SP effectively addresses workload imbalance in sparse attention models, enabling efficient scaling of Diffusion Transformer inference with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

*Zibo Zhou,Zhengjun Zhai,Huimin Chen,Wei Dai,Hansen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACIEC uses affective captioning and language models to bridge the affective gap in image emotion classification by converting images to emotional text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual models struggle with the "affective gap" - the disconnect between visual features and emotional content. Psychology shows language has rich affective information that can bridge this gap.

Method: 1) Hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss for detecting emotional concepts from images. 2) Emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning to generate affective sentences. 3) Using pre-trained language models to synthesize emotional concepts and sentences for classification. 4) Contrastive loss with semantic similarity sampling to handle dataset challenges. 5) Special handling of images with embedded text.

Result: Achieves superior results on multiple benchmarks, effectively bridging the affective gap in image emotion classification.

Conclusion: Converting images to affective text descriptions via language models effectively solves the affective gap problem in IEC, outperforming traditional visual-only approaches.

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: DNA-Prior: Universal unsupervised denoising framework using hybrid architectural and spectral-spatial priors for medical imaging without training data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image denoisers require large annotated datasets or supervised learning, limiting usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data

Method: Hybrid prior framework combining implicit architectural prior (deep network parameterization) with explicit spectral-spatial prior (frequency-domain fidelity term + spatial regularization functional) for unsupervised optimization

Result: Consistent noise suppression and structural preservation across multiple modalities under diverse noise conditions without external training data or modality-specific tuning

Conclusion: DNA-Prior provides a mathematically principled, universal unsupervised denoising solution that addresses limitations of supervised methods in clinical environments with heterogeneous data

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCamCtrl is an end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation that uses a dual-branch framework to generate camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences with semantic-guided alignment, achieving better geometry awareness and 40% reduction in camera motion errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation methods using ray-based camera pose representations lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness, limiting their ability to faithfully follow specified camera trajectories.

Method: Introduces a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences, with Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism for semantics-guided RGB-depth fusion and mutual reinforcement between modalities.

Result: Achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation with over 40% reduction in camera motion errors compared to prior methods, and reveals distinct roles of depth and camera poses across denoising stages.

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl effectively disentangles appearance and geometry modeling through its dual-branch framework and SIGMA mechanism, enabling more faithful adherence to specified camera trajectories in video generation.

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

TL;DR: InstanceV is a text-to-video generation framework that enables fine-grained instance-level control and global semantic consistency through novel attention mechanisms and guidance modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models lack fine-grained controllability over video generation, being limited to textual conditions without instance-level control or spatial positioning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention for spatial instance control, Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement for global consistency, Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance to prevent small instance disappearance, and introduces InstanceBench evaluation benchmark.

Result: InstanceV achieves remarkable instance-level controllability and outperforms state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: InstanceV successfully addresses the fine-grained controllability challenge in video generation while maintaining global semantic consistency, representing a significant advancement in controllable video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: Multi-stage document rectification framework that progressively corrects perspective, geometric, and content distortions, with new evaluation metrics for better assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world document rectification faces challenges from extreme camera perspective variations and physical distortions; existing methods struggle with complex transformations and evaluation protocols are limited.

Method: Three-stage coarse-to-fine framework: 1) global affine transformation for perspective correction, 2) geometric deformation rectification for paper curling/folding, 3) content-aware iterative process for fine-grained distortions. Also proposes new evaluation metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M).

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks with 14.1%-34.7% reduction in AAD metric, demonstrating superior real-world performance.

Conclusion: The progressive multi-stage approach effectively handles complex document distortions, and the proposed evaluation metrics provide more accurate assessment of rectification quality, with code publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chaoyunwang/ArbDR.

TL;DR: RA-RFT method improves Video Temporal Grounding by refusing hard-irrelevant queries using reinforcement fine-tuning with four reward objectives and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models always predict segments even for irrelevant queries, and current approaches fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant to the video.

Method: Propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization framework with four reward objectives: format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction. Also construct Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset.

Result: Method demonstrates effectiveness across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. Shows scalability by applying to various LVLM-based VTG models.

Conclusion: RA-RFT effectively addresses the limitation of existing VTG models in handling hard-irrelevant queries through reinforcement fine-tuning with comprehensive reward objectives and specialized dataset construction.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

TL;DR: PowerCLIP introduces powerset alignment for contrastive vision-language pre-training, enabling fine-grained compositional understanding by aligning subsets of image regions with textual parse trees using efficient non-linear aggregators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-style models struggle to capture compositional semantics spanning multiple image regions, limiting their ability to understand complex visual-textual relationships that require reasoning across different parts of an image.

Method: Proposes PowerCLIP with powerset alignment that optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing loss between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Uses efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) to reduce computational complexity from exponential O(2^M) to linear O(M).

Result: PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, demonstrating superior compositionality and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The powerset alignment framework with efficient NLAs effectively addresses the limitation of capturing multi-region compositional semantics in vision-language models, leading to improved zero-shot performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [179] [Fast Multi-view Consistent 3D Editing with Video Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23172)
*Liyi Chen,Ruihuang Li,Guowen Zhang,Pengfei Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP3DE uses video generation models for fast, consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass by leveraging temporal consistency priors instead of iterative 2D-3D-2D updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven 3D editing methods are slow and produce over-smoothed results due to iterative multi-view processing that averages different editing signals across views.

Method: Uses pre-trained video generation models conditioned on a single edited view to generate other consistent views directly. Introduces motion-preserved noise blending for specific camera poses and geometry-aware denoising for better multi-view consistency.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D editing results in a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Conclusion: Video generation models provide effective temporal consistency priors for efficient multi-view consistent 3D editing, bypassing the limitations of iterative editing paradigms.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

TL;DR: GeoWorld improves image-to-3D scene generation by using geometry models with video frames instead of single-frame depth, achieving better geometric consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video-based image-to-3D generation methods suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content due to limited geometric information from single-frame inputs.

Method: Generate consecutive video frames first, then use geometry models to extract full-frame geometry features as conditions for video generation. Add geometry alignment loss for real-world constraints and geometry adaptation module for effective feature utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments show GeoWorld generates high-fidelity 3D scenes from single images and camera trajectories, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: GeoWorld successfully renovates image-to-3D scene generation by leveraging geometry models with video frames, achieving superior geometric consistency and visual quality compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology foundation models are often too large (billion+ parameters) with high-dimensional embeddings, limiting their practical use in research and clinical settings with constrained computing resources.

Method: Multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning, allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions while reducing model size.

Conclusion: Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology foundation models by enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness for broader research and clinical use.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

TL;DR: Zero-shot quality inspection framework using real-time Digital Twins in RGB-D space for industrial defect detection without extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early visual inspection is crucial for Zero-Defect Manufacturing but current systems are complex and data-hungry, limiting adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings.

Method: Pose-agnostic, zero-shot framework comparing real scenes against real-time Digital Twins using object detection, pose estimation of CAD models, and hierarchical annotation for multi-criteria defect detection.

Result: Achieved up to 63.3% IoU scores compared to ground-truth masks using simple distance measurements in automotive axial flux motor inspection under semi-controlled conditions.

Conclusion: Framework enables efficient defect detection with minimal data requirements, laying groundwork for generalizable, low-data methods in dynamic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

TL;DR: Instruction tuning with limited data (7K instructions) and compute (A100, <6 hours) enables open-source LLM to match GPT-4o's tabular data generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular instruction tuning focuses only on QA/reasoning tasks, leaving tabular data generation largely unexplored. The authors aim to address this gap while tackling the high data and computation requirements typically associated with instruction tuning.

Method: Created a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data generation, then instruction-tuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on only 7K instructions using an A100 GPU for less than 6 hours.

Result: Achieved tabular data generation performance on par with GPT-4o, demonstrating that effective instruction tuning for tabular data generation can be done with limited data and computational resources.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with carefully curated datasets and modest computational resources can enable open-source LLMs to match state-of-the-art commercial models in tabular data generation tasks.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Wenjie Li,Piaopiao Yu,Yurong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CB-KNN improves 3DGS-SLAM tracking by using smooth kernel rendering to make pose optimization more robust to parameter errors, rather than just chasing perfect rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional wisdom that rendering quality alone determines tracking accuracy in 3DGS-SLAM. Instead, focus on making rasterization robust to parameter errors for stable camera pose tracking.

Method: Propose Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN) that adaptively modifies RGB values and locations of K-nearest neighboring Gaussians to create smoother local rendering, acting as regularization for pose optimization.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking while maintaining overall scene reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Robustness to parameter errors is more critical than perfect rendering for 3DGS-SLAM tracking; smooth kernel approach via CB-KNN effectively stabilizes pose optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases is challenging in real plantations due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves, leading to missed detections and false positives in existing detectors.

Method: Enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) Dual-Attention Fusion Module combining convolutional local features with self-attention global context; (2) occlusion-aware detection head learning visible-occluded part relationships; (3) C2f-DSConv module using dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes.

Conclusion: DAONet-YOLOv8 effectively addresses challenges in tea pest/disease detection through attention mechanisms, occlusion handling, and adaptive feature extraction, demonstrating superior performance over mainstream detection models in complex plantation environments.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointCNN++ is a novel 3D point cloud convolution method that generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points, achieving both high geometric precision and computational efficiency through native point-based operations with optimized GPU kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud learning methods face a precision-performance trade-off: point-based methods preserve geometric precision but suffer performance issues, while voxel-based methods are efficient but lose geometric fidelity through quantization, which is critical for tasks like point cloud registration.

Method: 1) Introduces point-centric convolution with receptive fields centered on original high-precision point coordinates. 2) Formulates convolution as Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem. 3) Develops dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel for native point operations.

Result: PointCNN++ uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster than point-based methods. When replacing voxel-based backbones, it significantly improves point cloud registration accuracy while being more memory-efficient and faster.

Conclusion: PointCNN++ demonstrates that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, enabling a new class of 3D learning with both high fidelity and efficiency, fundamentally mitigating the precision-performance trade-off in point cloud processing.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

Motivation: 3D functionality understanding requires identifying functional elements for actions, but real-world data collection is expensive and scarce.

Method: SynthFun3D uses furniture asset databases with part-level annotations to generate 3D scenes from action descriptions, automatically identifying functional element masks.

Result: User studies show improved scene-prompt coherence; synthetic data can replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement it for better performance.

Conclusion: SynthFun3D provides an inexpensive, scalable solution for generating high-quality annotated 3D data to address data scarcity in 3D applications.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs/LVLMs show strong reasoning in English but significantly underperform in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns. Existing approaches require costly multilingual training or external translation tools, which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality.

Method: MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors during inference: (1) cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors that steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space, and (2) target-language output anchoring vectors that restore target language distribution to preserve input-output consistency.

Result: Experiments across 6 LLMs/LVLMs on 4 reasoning benchmarks show MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by average 5.48% gain, up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

Conclusion: MRRE provides an effective training-free solution to enhance multilingual reasoning capabilities without additional data or tools, addressing fairness concerns while maintaining language consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing data generation and annotation costs for ML deployment in industrial/robotics settings, while bridging the sim-to-real gap without expert intervention.

Method: Benchmarked DR and DA techniques including feature-based methods (brightness filtering, perceptual hashing), GenAI approaches, and classical rendering for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation.

Result: Perceptual hashing achieved best performance (98% mAP50 on industrial dataset, 67% on robotics dataset). Feature-based methods outperformed GenAI in both accuracy and resource efficiency, with GenAI showing significant time overhead without mAP improvement.

Conclusion: Simpler feature-based methods are more effective and efficient than complex GenAI approaches for sim-to-real transfer when sufficient variable render-based seed data is available, offering actionable insights for synthetic data training.

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

TL;DR: FACT-GS introduces frequency-aware texture allocation for Gaussian Splatting, replacing uniform sampling with adaptive density based on local visual complexity to improve detail preservation under same parameter budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture-based Gaussian Splatting uses uniform per-Gaussian sampling grids, which inefficiently allocate texture space - high-frequency regions are under-sampled (causing blur) while smooth regions waste capacity, leading to loss of fine structural details.

Method: FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as differentiable sampling-density allocation using a learnable frequency-aware strategy via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density, performing non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids while maintaining real-time performance.

Result: The method recovers sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget compared to uniform texture allocation approaches, preserving real-time rendering performance while improving texture space utilization efficiency.

Conclusion: FACT-GS successfully addresses the inefficiency of uniform texture sampling in Gaussian Splatting by introducing adaptive frequency-aware allocation, enabling better detail preservation and more efficient texture space utilization without sacrificing real-time performance.

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color correction algorithms inspired by human color vision lack clear characterization of their behavior on image features like contrast and dispersion. Need for perceptually-inspired variational formulation with explicit requirements.

Method: Proposed variational formulation with set of basic requirements for perceptually-inspired energy functionals. Identified explicit class of functionals satisfying requirements, selected three of basic interest. Used gradient descent to find minima. Developed methodology to reduce computational cost from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Result: Established framework for perceptually-inspired color contrast enhancement with explicit functionals that satisfy perceptual requirements. Showed similarities/differences with existing models. Achieved significant computational efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: Variational approach provides principled framework for color contrast enhancement with clear perceptual foundations and computational efficiency, enabling better characterization of image feature behavior.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Conclusion: The proposed GeoSeg-1M dataset, GeoSeg-Bench benchmark, and UniGeoSeg framework address limitations in remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, enabling better understanding and generalization through large-scale data and unified multi-task learning.

Abstract: Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: Markov-VAR reformulates visual autoregressive modeling as a non-full-context Markov process using sliding window compression, achieving better performance with 83.8% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-context dependency in VAR models causes computational inefficiency and high overhead, hindering practicality and scalability despite better representation learning.

Method: Reformulate VAR as Markov process with Markovian Scale Prediction: treat scales as Markov states, use sliding window to compress previous scales into compact history vector, combine with current state for dynamic state evolution.

Result: Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% on ImageNet 256×256 and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% on 1024×1024 compared to original VAR.

Conclusion: Markov-VAR is simple yet effective, offering foundation for future visual autoregressive generation research with significantly improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Computer vision pipeline using YOLOv11 and PaddleOCR extracts vital signs from bedside monitor screens without hardware replacement, achieving 98.9% accuracy for core parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource healthcare settings have standalone bedside monitors without network connectivity, creating an interoperability gap that prevents integration of physiological data into EHR systems. Costly hardware replacement is not feasible.

Method: Hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for monitor and ROI localization with PaddleOCR for text extraction. Includes geometric rectification module to standardize screen perspective across variable camera angles and lighting conditions.

Result: Evaluated on 6,498 images from open-source corpora and real-world ICUs in Vietnam. Achieved mAP@50-95 of 99.5% for monitor detection, 91.5% for vital sign ROI localization, and end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeding 98.9% for core parameters (heart rate, SpO2, arterial blood pressure).

Conclusion: Lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured screen information into structured digital data, providing practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: DEAL-300K is a large-scale dataset for localizing diffusion-based image edits, with a new method using frozen visual foundation models and multi-frequency prompt tuning to detect edited regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image editing enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to detect, but existing benchmarks don't capture the smooth blending properties of diffusion edits. There's a need for better localization of these subtle manipulations.

Method: Created DEAL-300K dataset using multi-modal LLM for editing instructions, mask-free diffusion editor for manipulated images, and active-learning change detection for pixel-level annotations. Proposed localization framework with frozen Visual Foundation Model and Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning to capture semantic and frequency-domain cues.

Result: Achieved 82.56% pixel-level F1 score on test split and 80.97% on external CoCoGlide benchmark, establishing strong baselines for diffusion-based image manipulation localization.

Conclusion: DEAL-300K provides a practical foundation for future DIML research, addressing the challenge of localizing diffusion-based edits that blend smoothly with original content.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQRAE is a unified tokenizer that produces continuous semantic features for image understanding and discrete tokens for visual generation within a single model, using vector quantization and a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with unifying understanding, generation, and reconstruction in a single tokenizer, typically using separate encoders or complex balancing mechanisms. There's a need for a unified representation that can handle both continuous semantic understanding and discrete generation tokens.

Method: VQRAE builds on pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder using a two-stage training strategy: 1) freeze encoder and learn high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction, 2) jointly optimize encoder with self-distillation constraints. Uses high-dimensional codebook (1536 dimensions) instead of traditional low-dimensional ones.

Result: Achieves 100% utilization ratio of semantic VQ codebook at 1536 dimensions. Shows competitive performance on visual understanding, generation, and reconstruction benchmarks with promising scaling properties in autoregressive paradigms due to discrete token advantages.

Conclusion: VQRAE successfully unifies multimodal understanding, generation, and reconstruction in a single tokenizer, demonstrating that high-dimensional semantic codebooks work better than low-dimensional ones for quantizing semantic encoders, enabling both continuous understanding and discrete generation capabilities.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater tracking is difficult due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering that distort object appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing terrestrial-trained trackers fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations.

Method: 1) Dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations for robust features. 2) Multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with physics-informed secondary association algorithm integrating geometric consistency and appearance similarity. 3) Novel evaluation metrics: Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS).

Result: MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220), improving Success AUC by up to 6%, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

Conclusion: The physics-informed framework successfully addresses underwater tracking challenges by integrating representation learning with tracking design, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across diverse underwater conditions.

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

TL;DR: DisMo learns abstract motion representations from videos via image reconstruction, enabling motion transfer across unrelated objects without object correspondences, and works with any video generator via lightweight adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V and I2V models lack explicit motion representations separate from content, limiting creative control and motion transfer capabilities across different objects/scenes.

Method: Learn abstract motion representations directly from raw video data using image-space reconstruction objective, creating motion semantics independent of appearance/content, with lightweight adapters for integration with existing video generators.

Result: Enables open-world motion transfer across semantically unrelated entities without object correspondences, outperforms V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on Something-Something v2 and Jester benchmarks.

Conclusion: DisMo provides a generic motion representation that disentangles motion from appearance, enabling accurate motion transfer and serving as effective features for downstream motion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 represents a new paradigm for generative game world modeling that enables flexible, semantically rich interaction through natural language and input signals, overcoming limitations of traditional rigid action schemas.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Conclusion: Data synthesis methods using object-centric data can effectively address the data scarcity problem for novel object detection, particularly for long-tailed classes, by generating realistic training images that improve model generalization.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

Conclusion: VGT demonstrates that pretrained VLMs harbor inherent visual generation capabilities that can be efficiently unlocked, paving the way for next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos.

*Hanoona Rasheed,Mohammed Zumri,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video CoM introduces interactive video reasoning where models actively manipulate videos through iterative visual actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat video as static context, creating semantic bottlenecks where models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding.

Method: Video CoM uses Chain of Manipulations (CoM) for iterative visual actions, trained on Video CoM Instruct dataset (18K samples) with supervised learning and optimized via reinforcement learning using reasoning-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with step-level reasoning rewards.

Result: Achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6% over recent SOTA models while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO samples (significantly fewer than comparable large-scale models).

Conclusion: Interactive video reasoning with iterative visual manipulations and reasoning-aware rewards enables more grounded, consistent, and interpretable video understanding, overcoming limitations of passive video processing paradigms.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

TL;DR: Video R2 model improves video reasoning by enhancing temporal alignment and logical consistency through reinforcement learning with temporal alignment rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models generate reasoning traces that appear convincing but are often logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence, relying too heavily on linguistic priors rather than actual video content.

Method: Proposes reinforcement learning approach with timestamp-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR) to enhance temporal precision and reasoning consistency.

Result: Video R2 achieves higher Think Answer Consistency (TAC), Video Attention Score (VAS), and accuracy across 11 video reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and reasoning coherence.

Conclusion: Improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding, with the model, code, and dataset being open-sourced.

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MAPF formulations use simplified robot models that overlook real-world execution factors like kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability, creating a problematic gap between planning and execution for time-sensitive applications.

Method: REMAP integrates ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths, and can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners (MAPF-LNS and CBS) with minor changes to solve MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problems.

Result: Experiments show REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents.

Conclusion: REMAP successfully bridges the planning-execution gap in MAPF by providing execution-informed planning that improves solution quality for real-world deadline-constrained applications.

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to find collision-free paths for multiple agents while optimizing objectives such as the sum of costs or makespan. MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS. Experiments show that REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents.

*Alex Richardson,Jonathan Sprinkle*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OpenTwinMap is an open-source Python framework for creating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins from LiDAR and OpenStreetMap data for autonomous vehicle simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital twin tools for AV research are often simulator-specific, difficult to extend, or have high technical overhead. CARLA's framework is implemented as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping.

Method: Python-based framework that ingests LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap data to generate semantically segmented static environment assets (road networks, terrain, urban structures) that can be exported to Unreal Engine for AV simulation.

Result: Current capabilities include preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration. The framework emphasizes extensibility and parallelization.

Conclusion: OpenTwinMap lowers the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale digital twin pipelines to diverse urban contexts, addressing limitations of existing tightly-coupled solutions.

Abstract: Digital twins of urban environments play a critical role in advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) research by enabling simulation, validation, and integration with emerging generative world models. While existing tools have demonstrated value, many publicly available solutions are tightly coupled to specific simulators, difficult to extend, or introduce significant technical overhead. For example, CARLA-the most widely used open-source AV simulator-provides a digital twin framework implemented entirely as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping. In this work, we propose OpenTwinMap, an open-source, Python-based framework for generating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins. The completed framework will ingest LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to produce semantically segmented static environment assets, including road networks, terrain, and urban structures, which can be exported into Unreal Engine for AV simulation. OpenTwinMap emphasizes extensibility and parallelization, lowering the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale the pipeline to diverse urban contexts. We describe the current capabilities of the OpenTwinMap, which includes preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration.

TL;DR: Robust planning algorithm (RSPECT) for UAV-UGV teams performing long-horizon monitoring missions with energy constraints and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust planning of energy-constrained UAVs with mobile charging stations (UGVs) to perform long monitoring missions in uncertain environments without major plan revisions.

Method: Formulate as NP-hard mixed-integer program, propose RSPECT heuristic algorithm with theoretical guarantees on complexity, feasibility, and robustness.

Result: Scalable and efficient heuristic demonstrated through simulations and experiments, with theoretical analysis of algorithm properties.

Conclusion: RSPECT provides practical solution for robust planning of UAV-UGV teams in uncertain environments, balancing computational efficiency with mission reliability.

Abstract: We consider the robust planning of energy-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which act as mobile charging stations, to perform long-horizon aerial monitoring missions. More specifically, given a set of points to be visited by the UAVs and desired final positions of the UAV-UGV teams, the objective is to find a robust plan (the vehicle trajectories) that can be realized without a major revision in the face of uncertainty (e.g., unknown obstacles/terrain, wind) to complete this mission in minimum time. We provide a formal description of this problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP), which is NP-hard. Since exact solution methods are computationally intractable for such problems, we propose RSPECT, a scalable and efficient heuristic. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of our algorithm and the feasibility and robustness of resulting plans. We also demonstrate the performance of our method via simulations and experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current additive and subtractive manufacturing methods rely on discrete stacking or local removal, which limits continuous deformation control, causes volume loss, and leads to shape deviations.

*Xuchen Liu,Ruocheng Li,Bin Xin,Weijia Yao,Qigeng Duan,Jinqiang Cui,Ben M. Chen,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-time quadrotor navigation framework using adaptive guiding vector fields from discrete path points for robust closed-loop control in unknown complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing quadrotor planning frameworks operate in open-loop manner, making them vulnerable to environmental uncertainties like wind disturbances and external perturbations in unknown complex environments.

Method: Unified framework with: 1) Onboard perception building ESDF for obstacle awareness, 2) Global planner generating collision-free path points, 3) B-spline parameterization for smooth reference trajectory, 4) Adaptive GVF synthesis from ESDF and optimized trajectory for closed-loop navigation.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop navigation framework with adaptive guiding vector fields enables robust real-time quadrotor navigation in unknown complex environments, overcoming limitations of conventional open-loop planning methods.

Abstract: Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.

*Tai Inui,Jee-Hwan Ryu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures use game theory to soften traditional virtual fixtures with a single parameter τ, reducing user conflict while maintaining accuracy in teleoperation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual fixtures improve precision but often "fight" the user, increasing mental workload and reducing the sense of agency. There's a need for shared-control policies that maintain accuracy while improving user comfort and perceived control.

Method: Proposed Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single scalar parameter τ. Derived from KL-regularized trust-region and maximum-entropy perspectives, yielding a closed-form robot best response that reduces authority and aligns with operator input as τ increases.

Result: Implemented on 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking tasks. Moderate softness (τ≈1-3, especially τ=2) maintained tracking error statistically indistinguishable from tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency. Composite BalancedScore peaked near τ=2-3.

Conclusion: Soft-Nash policy with a single parameter can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation.

Abstract: Virtual fixtures (VFs) improve precision in teleoperation but often ``fight'' the user, inflating mental workload and eroding the sense of agency. We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $τ=2-3$. These results show that a one-parameter Soft-Nash policy can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between actuation complexity and dexterity in robotic hands, where biological synergies enable human-like manipulation but excessive coupling reduces dexterity.

Method: Proposed anthropomorphic finger topology with 4 degrees of freedom driven by 2 actuators, developed modular hand design based on biological synergy analysis and human gesture studies, established kinematic model for adaptive grasping and manipulation.

Result: Built physical prototype and conducted preliminary experiments that validated the effectiveness of the proposed biomimetic design and kinematic analysis for adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation.

Conclusion: The modular dexterous hand successfully balances actuation simplicity with manipulation capability through biomimetic synergy principles, demonstrating practical implementation of biological coordination in robotic hand design.

Abstract: Biological synergies have emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for dexterous hand design, enabling human-like manipulation with a small number of actuators. Nonetheless, excessive coupling tends to diminish the dexterity of hands. This paper tackles the trade-off between actuation complexity and dexterity by proposing an anthropomorphic finger topology with 4 DoFs driven by 2 actuators, and by developing an adaptive, modular dexterous hand based on this finger topology. We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture. Leveraging these biomimetic mappings, we design a five-finger modular hand and establish its kinematic model to analyze adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation. Finally, we construct a physical prototype and conduct preliminary experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis.

TL;DR: FAKP-Net introduces 3D keypoint quadruplets to go beyond semantic segmentation, providing what, where, and how information for robotic manipulation by fusing RGB and Depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current affordance detection methods treat it as semantic segmentation focusing only on "what" objects can be used for, lacking guidance on "where" and "how" to manipulate objects.

Method: Proposes Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) using 3D keypoint quadruplets that combine RGB and Depth images to provide execution position, direction, and extent information.

Result: Outperforms existing models by significant margins in both affordance segmentation and keypoint detection tasks, and shows reliability in real-world manipulation with unseen objects.

Conclusion: The 3D keypoint approach successfully bridges the gap between affordance understanding and actionable manipulation guidance, enabling more effective robotic interaction with objects.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for affordance-informed robotic manipulation by introducing 3D keypoints to enhance the understanding of object parts' functionality. The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects.

*Gabriel Aguirre,Simay Atasoy Bingöl,Heiko Hamann,Jonas Kuckling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized Bayesian framework enables robot swarms to identify safer areas in hazardous environments using Poisson process event rates, achieving sample-efficient decision-making with improved safety and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for effective collective decision-making in swarm robotics that balances exploration, communication, and uncertainty estimation in hazardous environments where direct measurements are limited or costly.

Method: Decentralized Bayesian framework using conjugate priors to predict times between hazardous events (modeled as Poisson processes) and derive confidence estimates for adaptive behavior in robot swarms.

Result: Robot swarm consistently chooses correct safer area while reducing exposure to hazardous events through sample efficiency; outperforms baseline heuristics in safety and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The framework extends collective decision-making benchmarks and has applications in adaptive risk-aware sampling and exploration in hazardous, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Effective collective decision-making in swarm robotics often requires balancing exploration, communication and individual uncertainty estimation, especially in hazardous environments where direct measurements are limited or costly. We propose a decentralized Bayesian framework that enables a swarm of simple robots to identify the safer of two areas, each characterized by an unknown rate of hazardous events governed by a Poisson process. Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient. Compared to baseline heuristics, our proposed approach shows better performance in terms of safety and speed of convergence. The proposed scenario has potential to extend the current set of benchmarks in collective decision-making and our method has applications in adaptive risk-aware sampling and exploration in hazardous, dynamic environments.

*Ryosuke Ofuchi,Yuichiro Toda,Naoki Masuyama,Takayuki Matsuno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MLATC extends ATC-DT with hierarchical organization to accelerate topological map building from LiDAR data, achieving sublinear scaling and real-time performance in large-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ATC-DT suffers from scalability limitations due to exhaustive nearest-neighbor searches over all nodes as maps grow, making it inefficient for large-scale environments.

Method: Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC) organizes nodes hierarchically from coarse to fine resolutions, uses adaptive layer addition when lower layers saturate, and reduces distance evaluations per query.

Result: MLATC achieves sublinear (approximately logarithmic) scaling of search time, millisecond-level per-frame runtime, and significantly outperforms ATC-DT in computational efficiency for real-world campus-scale datasets.

Conclusion: MLATC enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments while maintaining low hyperparameter requirements and effectively addressing scalability limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of building global topological maps from 3D LiDAR point clouds for autonomous mobile robots operating in large-scale, dynamic, and unknown environments. Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Soft urethane sheet valve with amplifier performs pneumatic logic operations, enabling fluidic circuits without electronics


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieve high functionality and flexibility in soft robot systems using purely pneumatic control, eliminating need for electronic components

Method: Developed fluidic sheet transistor (FST) - soft urethane valve that buckles under pressure to block main channel, acting as NOT logic element; integrated multiple FSTs on single sheet for complex logic operations

Result: Demonstrated logical operations (positive logic, NAND, NOR), built latch circuit, created fluid robot system with tactile tube detector and actuators that changes posture when hitting obstacles using only air pressure

Conclusion: FST enables purely pneumatic logical operations, verified effectiveness through fluid robot system that responds to obstacles without electronics

Abstract: Aiming to achieve both high functionality and flexibility in soft robot system, this paper presents a soft urethane sheet-like valve with an amplifier that can perform logical operations using only pneumatic signals. When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators. This demonstrates that it is possible to generate behavior that actively changes posture when hitting an obstacle using only air pressure from a single pipe, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

*Denghan Xiong,Yanzhe Zhao,Yutong Chen,Zichun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learned policy for Ackermann vehicles escapes narrow dead ends more effectively than classical planners by generating feasible forward-reverse maneuvers under nonholonomic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonholonomic constraints and Ackermann steering make collision-free geometric paths non-executable for car-like robots, especially in narrow dead ends where classical planners struggle due to low sampling efficiency and sensitivity to clearances.

Method: Three components: 1) Generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates envelopes to create guaranteed-feasible narrow dead ends; 2) Training environment enforcing kinematic constraints with soft actor-critic algorithm; 3) Evaluation against classical planners combining global search with nonholonomic steering.

Result: Learned policy solves larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, maintains comparable path length and planning time while operating under same sensing and control limits as classical planners.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approach outperforms classical planning methods for nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape in Ackermann vehicles, with open-source implementation provided.

Abstract: Nonholonomic constraints restrict feasible velocities without reducing configuration-space dimension, which makes collision-free geometric paths generally non-executable for car-like robots. Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits. We provide our project as open source at https://github.com/gitagitty/cisDRL-RobotNav.git

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoMuRoS is a hierarchical LLM-based architecture for heterogeneous robot teams that enables centralized task planning with decentralized execution and event-driven replanning, demonstrated on physical hardware with robust multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based robotic systems lack runtime event-driven replanning capabilities on physical robots, limiting their ability to handle dynamic environments, task failures, and human interactions in multi-robot teams.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with Task Manager LLM for goal interpretation, task classification, and allocation using static rules + dynamic contexts. Each robot runs local LLM to compose Python code from primitive skills, with onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) for event monitoring and classification. Event-driven replanning triggered by failures or intent changes.

Result: Hardware: Autonomous recovery from disruptions (9/10 multirobot collaborative object recovery, 8/8 coordinated transport, 5/5 human-assisted recovery). Simulation: Intention-aware replanning. Benchmark: 22 scenarios with high scores (correctness up to 0.91), separate replanning set achieves 1.0 correctness.

Conclusion: CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime event-driven replanning on physical robots, enabling robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration that outperforms prior LLM-based systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoMuRoS (Collaborative Multi-Robot System), a generalizable hierarchical architecture for heterogeneous robot teams that unifies centralized deliberation with decentralized execution, and supports event-driven replanning. A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.

*Seongwon Cho,Daechul Ahn,Donghyun Shin,Hyeonbeom Choi,San Kim,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BINDER is a dual-process framework for open-vocabulary mobile manipulation that combines strategic planning with continuous environment monitoring to address the blindness problem between discrete updates in prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior OVMM approaches only update world representation at discrete points (navigation targets, waypoints, action ends), leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures like overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning.

Method: BINDER decouples strategic planning from continuous monitoring using two modules: Deliberative Response Module (multimodal LLM for task planning) and Instant Response Module (VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). They coordinate bidirectionally - DRM guides what IRM attends to, while IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct actions, and trigger replanning.

Result: Evaluated in three real-world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: BINDER's dual-process framework effectively addresses the trade-off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) requires robots to follow language instructions, navigate, and manipulate while updating their world representation under dynamic environmental changes. However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.

TL;DR: VGDP is a multimodal imitation learning framework that uses modality-wise dropout to enforce balanced use of RGB and point-cloud cues, achieving strong generalization under visual and spatial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning methods struggle to generalize under spatial and visual randomizations and tend to overfit, creating a need for more robust observation encoders.

Method: Proposes Visual Geometry Diffusion Policy (VGDP) with Complementarity-Aware Fusion Module using modality-wise dropout to enforce balanced use of RGB and point-cloud cues, with cross-attention as lightweight interaction.

Result: Outperforms 7 baselines by 39.1% average improvement across 18 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, with 41.5% improvement under visual perturbations and 15.2% under spatial perturbations.

Conclusion: The expressiveness of the fused latent space comes from enforced complementarity via modality-wise dropout, not cross-attention, enabling strong robustness to visual and spatial variations.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a crucial ap proach for acquiring visuomotor skills from demonstrations, where designing effective observation encoders is essential for policy generalization. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize under spatial and visual randomizations, instead tending to overfit. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Geometry Diffusion Policy (VGDP), a multimodal imitation learning framework built around a Complementarity-Aware Fusion Module where modality-wise dropout enforces balanced use of RGB and point-cloud cues, with cross-attention serving only as a lightweight interaction layer. Our experiments show that the expressiveness of the fused latent space is largely induced by the enforced complementarity from modality-wise dropout, with cross-attention serving primarily as a lightweight interaction mechanism rather than the main source of robustness. Across a benchmark of 18 simulated tasks and 4 real-world tasks, VGDP outperforms seven baseline policies with an average performance improvement of 39.1%. More importantly, VGDP demonstrates strong robustness under visual and spatial per turbations, surpassing baselines with an average improvement of 41.5% in different visual conditions and 15.2% in different spatial settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RealD²iff: A diffusion-based framework that learns to synthesize realistic noisy depth from clean simulation data, enabling zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation without real-world data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The visual sim2real gap in robot manipulation arises because depth observations in simulation lack the complex noise patterns of real sensors, limiting real-world applicability of simulation-trained models.

Method: Proposes a clean-to-noisy paradigm using RealD²iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and local perturbations. Uses Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for local refinement. Integrates into a six-stage imitation learning pipeline.

Result: Enables two key applications: (1) generating realistic noisy depth to create clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection, and (2) achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation with substantially improved real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The clean-to-noisy paradigm using diffusion models effectively bridges the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven learning, enabling practical robot manipulation in the real world without costly real data collection or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Robot manipulation in the real world is fundamentally constrained by the visual sim2real gap, where depth observations collected in simulation fail to reflect the complex noise patterns inherent to real sensors. In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.

*Yanbo Mao,Jianlong Fu,Ruoxuan Zhang,Hongxia Xie,Meibao Yao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that improves robotic execution quality by learning an Elegance Critic to satisfy implicit task constraints, using just-in-time interventions without retraining base VLA policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models for robotic manipulation exhibit variable execution quality due to mixed-quality human demonstrations that only partially satisfy implicit principles governing how actions should be performed.

Method: Introduce LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit quality criteria; formalize Elegant Execution as satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints; train Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning; implement Just-in-Time Intervention mechanism for selective refinement.

Result: The learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks, even on unseen tasks, enabling robotic control that values both task success and execution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled refinement framework enables improved robotic execution quality without modifying base VLA policies, focusing on how tasks are performed rather than just whether they succeed.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled notable progress in general-purpose robotic manipulation, yet their learned policies often exhibit variable execution quality. We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks. The proposed model enables robotic control that values not only whether tasks succeed, but also how they are performed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot navigation in cluttered environments faces challenges with reactive collision avoidance vs. long-range goal achievement, especially in narrow passages where RL policies suffer from limited generalization and deadlocks in unseen configurations.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).

Conclusion: Coupling reactive RL navigation with selective MAPF intervention yields robust, zero-shot performance for multi-robot navigation in cluttered environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in cluttered environments presents fundamental challenges in balancing reactive collision avoidance with long-range goal achievement. When navigating through narrow passages
  or confined spaces, deadlocks frequently emerge that prevent agents from reaching their destinations, particularly when Reinforcement Learning (RL) control policies encounter novel configurations out of learning distribution. Existing RL-based approaches suffer from limited generalization capability in unseen environments. We propose a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) to explicitly resolve topological deadlocks. Our approach integrates a safety layer that monitors agent progress to detect deadlocks and, when detected, triggers a coordination controller for affected agents. The framework constructs globally feasible trajectories via MAPF and regulates waypoint progression to reduce inter-agent conflicts during navigation.
  Extensive evaluation on dense multi-agent benchmarks shows that our method boosts task completion from marginal to near-universal success, markedly reducing deadlocks and collisions.

TL;DR: Robotic Steering: A sparse fine-tuning method for Vision-Language Action models that selectively adapts task-specific attention heads using few-shot demonstrations, outperforming LoRA with better robustness, lower cost, and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for Vision-Language Action models lack specificity - they adapt the same parameters regardless of task characteristics (visual, linguistic, physical). Inspired by neuroscience's functional specificity, the authors hypothesize that sparse, task-specific fine-tuning would be more effective for robotic tasks.

Method: Robotic Steering uses mechanistic interpretability to analyze few-shot demonstrations, identifying and selectively fine-tuning only the attention heads that are specifically relevant to a task's physical, visual, and linguistic requirements, rather than adapting all parameters.

Result: The method outperforms LoRA in on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, showing superior robustness to task variations, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse, task-specific fine-tuning based on mechanistic interpretability is more effective than uniform parameter adaptation for Vision-Language Action models in robotics, offering better performance, robustness, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sit-to-stand devices (transfer aids and rehabilitation tools) cannot adapt to different mobility levels, limiting effective STS training for functional mobility improvement and rehospitalization risk reduction.

Method: Developed a novel STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces while maintaining commercial transfer capabilities, enabling adaptation to different training needs.

Result: Experiments with diverse healthy adults showed: 1) minimal impact on natural STS kinematics, 2) precise weight unloading at patient's center of mass, and 3) ability to add forward virtual spring assistance for seat-off phase.

Conclusion: The developed device successfully bridges the gap between transfer aids and rehabilitation tools by providing adjustable, personalized STS training support while preserving natural movement patterns.

Abstract: The ability to accomplish a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is key to increase functional mobility and reduce rehospitalization risks. While raising aid (transfer) devices and partial bodyweight support (rehabilitation) devices exist, both are unable to adjust the STS training to different mobility levels. Therefore, We have developed an STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces to adapt to many training needs while maintaining commercial raising aid transfer capabilities. Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.

TL;DR: Multi-view depth-based locomotion framework combines egocentric and exocentric observations to improve quadrupedal robot agility and robustness through teacher-student distillation and domain randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legged locomotion methods rely on egocentric perception, limiting performance when robot's viewpoint is occluded. Need to enhance environmental awareness using complementary viewpoints like multiple actors exchanging perceptual information.

Method: Teacher-student distillation approach where student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams (egocentric + exocentric). Extensive domain randomization including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations to emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing.

Result: Multi-viewpoint policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers. Maintain stability when exocentric camera is partially/completely unavailable. Moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion. Implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent progress in legged locomotion has allowed highly dynamic and parkour-like behaviors for robots, similar to their biological counterparts. Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion. Furthermore, to support reproducibility, the implementation accompanying this work is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/multiview-parkour-6FB8

*Rui Heng Yang,Xuan Zhao,Leo Maxime Brunswic,Montgomery Alban,Mateo Clemente,Tongtong Cao,Jun Jin,Amir Rasouli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAPE is a diffusion policy framework that expands trajectory modes with context-aware priors and iterative guided refinement for better generalization in unseen environments, especially for collision avoidance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in robotics require large-scale datasets for optimal performance, which is costly for challenging tasks like collision avoidance. Generalization demands coverage of many obstacle types and spatial configurations that are impractical to acquire purely via data.

Method: CAPE (Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion) expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. It generates an initial trajectory, executes a short prefix, perturbs the remaining segment to intermediate noise level to form a context-aware prior, then repeats with context-aware guided denoising to iteratively expand mode support for smoother, less collision-prone trajectories.

Result: CAPE achieves up to 26% higher success rates in simulated settings and 80% higher success rates in real-world settings compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments for diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered settings.

Conclusion: CAPE effectively addresses the data efficiency problem in diffusion-based imitation learning by expanding trajectory modes with context-aware priors, enabling successful generalization to unseen environments with complex obstacle configurations while maintaining goal consistency.

Abstract: In robotics, diffusion models can capture multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, making them a transformative approach in imitation learning. However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments.

TL;DR: NICE framework uses generative AI to edit robotic demonstration scenes by replacing, restyling, or removing distracting objects to improve imitation learning robustness without additional data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual distractors in real-world robotic manipulation degrade performance and safety, creating out-of-distribution gaps in imitation learning that need to be addressed without costly additional data collection.

Method: NICE uses image generative frameworks and LLMs to perform three editing operations on existing demonstrations: object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting objects while preserving spatial relationships and action-label consistency.

Result: NICE achieves over 20% improvement in affordance prediction accuracy in cluttered scenes, 11% average increase in manipulation success rates with distractors, 6% reduction in target confusion, and 7% lower collision rates.

Conclusion: NICE provides an effective, scalable framework for enhancing robotic imitation learning robustness against visual distractors without requiring additional data collection, simulator access, or custom model training.

Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation remains a challenge in real-world settings, where visual distractors can significantly degrade performance and safety. In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.
  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%.

TL;DR: Researchers propose a psychophysical evaluation protocol for robotic manipulation policies in cluttered scenes using a unified clutter measure, revealing significant performance drops (up to 34%) and unique vulnerabilities across VLA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior evaluation methods for robotic manipulation policies lack a comprehensive approach to measuring clutter that accounts for environmental factors, distractor characteristics, and arrangement. The paper aims to provide a more systematic evaluation from a psychophysical perspective.

Method: Developed a unified clutter measure considering environmental factors, distractor quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Used this measure to systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world settings. Conducted extensive experiments on vision-language-action (VLA) manipulation policies.

Result: Scene clutter significantly lowers policy performance by up to 34%. Different VLA policies show unique vulnerabilities despite similar average performance, with low agreement on success scenarios. The clutter measure effectively indicates performance degradation, and distractor quantity/occlusion impact was analyzed. Finetuning on enhanced data helps but doesn't equally remedy all clutter impacts.

Conclusion: The proposed psychophysical evaluation protocol and unified clutter measure provide valuable insights into robotic manipulation policy performance in cluttered environments, revealing significant vulnerabilities and performance degradation that current methods don't fully address.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an evaluation protocol for examining the performance of robotic manipulation policies in cluttered scenes. Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.

Motivation: Need for safe and efficient trajectory planning in complex driving scenarios like autonomous lane changing, where traditional approaches may not adequately handle dynamic collision risks and kinematic feasibility simultaneously.

Method: 1) Construct dynamic risk fields (DRF) capturing static and dynamic collision risks; 2) Generate time-varying convex feasible spaces ensuring kinematic feasibility and safety; 3) Formulate as finite-horizon optimal control problem solved with constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm.

Result: Outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPC, RRT) with collision-free trajectories, shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s), smooth acceleration, larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness in dense roundabout environments.

Conclusion: Integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic, interactive traffic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel trajectory planning pipeline for complex driving scenarios like autonomous lane changing, by integrating risk-aware planning with guaranteed collision avoidance into a unified optimization framework. We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing tasks such as transportation and aerial photography are vulnerable to intentional projectile attacks from humans. Dodging such a sudden and fast projectile poses a significant challenge for UAVs, requiring ultra-low latency responses and agile maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from baseball, in which pitchers' body movements are analyzed to predict the ball's trajectory, we propose a novel real-time dodging system that leverages an RGB-D camera. Our approach integrates human pose estimation with depth information to predict the attacker's motion trajectory and the subsequent projectile trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware dodging strategy to enable the UAV to dodge incoming projectiles efficiently. Our perception system achieves high prediction accuracy and outperforms the baseline in effective distance and latency. The dodging strategy addresses temporal and spatial uncertainties to ensure UAV safety. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the framework's reliable dodging capabilities against sudden attacks and its outstanding robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: Underwater visual localization is challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, poor texture, and non-Gaussian sensor noise, which traditional methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Three-part framework: 1) Front-end with Physics Aware Radiance Adapter for transformer-based feature matching compensating for color attenuation and contrast loss; 2) Factor-graph backend fusing visual, inertial, and pressure measurements using GTSAM; 3) Reinforcement-Learning-based Pose-Graph Optimizer for global trajectory refinement beyond local minima.

Result: The system produces geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity and provides full-state MAP estimates in real time with improved global trajectory optimization through learned retraction actions on SE(2).

Conclusion: MARVO demonstrates an effective approach to underwater visual localization by integrating physics-aware modeling with learning techniques to overcome the unique challenges of underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater visual localization remains challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, poor texture, and non-Gaussian sensor noise. We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E planning systems are uncertainty-blind, assuming perception outputs are fully reliable even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving planners without explicit uncertainty measures.

Method: Proposes a camera-only E2E framework that: 1) estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space, 2) produces dense uncertainty-aware drivability maps with pixel-level resolution, 3) introduces lane-following regularization to encode lane structure and traffic norms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM benchmark with substantial gains on both challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets.

Conclusion: Principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) planning has become a powerful paradigm for autonomous driving, yet current systems remain fundamentally uncertainty-blind. They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV systems lack semantic understanding to recognize potential risk situations from subtle precursors, and existing datasets lack annotations of causal reasoning chains needed for proactive safety.

Method: Introduces PotentialRiskQA dataset with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes, plus PR-Reasoner framework based on vision-language models for onboard potential risk reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA significantly enhances PR-Reasoner's performance on potential risk reasoning compared to baseline VLMs, demonstrating improved foresight capabilities.

Conclusion: The dataset and model provide foundation for developing AVs with improved proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient autonomous systems.

Abstract: Ensuring safety remains a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in rare and complex scenarios. One critical but understudied aspect is the \textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs.

Conclusion: Humanoid-LLA successfully addresses the challenge of language-conditioned whole-body control for humanoid robots, enabling expressive language command following with physical plausibility and robustness.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to follow free-form language commands is critical for seamless human-robot interaction, collaborative task execution, and general-purpose embodied intelligence. While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability.

Abstract: Reliable positioning in GNSS-challenged environments remains a critical challenge for navigation systems. Tightly coupled GNSS/IMU fusion improves robustness but remains vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. We present a robust and adaptive factor graph-based fusion framework that directly integrates GNSS pseudorange measurements with IMU preintegration factors and incorporates the Barron loss, a general robust loss function that unifies several m-estimators through a single tunable parameter. By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning.

*Zuolei Li,Xingyu Gao,Xiaofan Wang,Jianlong Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Universal Latent Action Learning framework learns transferable robot actions from videos by combining visual reconstruction with action sequence prediction, enabling few-shot transfer to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for learning latent actions from videos rely too heavily on visual reconstruction and neglect physical priors, leading to suboptimal universal representations that don't transfer well to different robot embodiments.

Method: Proposes a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, optimizing both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction (gripper/hand trajectories and orientations). Decomposes latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to separate robot movements from environmental changes.

Result: Achieves strong performance on simulated benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. With only 10 real-world trajectories per task on a Franka robot, successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability.

Conclusion: Incorporating action predictions alongside visual reconstruction enables learning richer physical priors (real-world distances/orientations), making latent actions more transferable across different robot embodiments and tasks with minimal real-world data.

Abstract: Learning transferable latent actions from large-scale object manipulation videos can significantly enhance generalization in downstream robotics tasks, as such representations are agnostic to different robot embodiments. Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.

Result: Validated in three human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating ability to produce executable policies with minimal manual effort

Conclusion: Combining language models with formal methods enables more accessible and scalable probabilistic planning in robotics

Abstract: We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning and formal verification to streamline the creation and use of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Our system leverages LLMs to extract structured knowledge in the form of a Prolog knowledge base from natural language (NL) descriptions. It then automatically constructs an MDP through reachability analysis, and synthesises optimal policies using the Storm model checker. The resulting policy is exported as a state-action table for execution. We validate the framework in three human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating its ability to produce executable policies with minimal manual effort. This work highlights the potential of combining language models with formal methods to enable more accessible and scalable probabilistic planning in robotics.

TL;DR: UNOGrasp is a vision-language model for robotic grasping that performs obstruction reasoning to plan actions for clearing obstructions before grasping target objects in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language embodied reasoning models have limited obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning capabilities for robotic grasping in cluttered environments, creating a need for specialized models that can reason about obstructions and plan clearing actions.

Method: UNOGrasp uses a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths from target objects, anchored with obstruction-aware visual cues. It combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning with verifiable reasoning rewards, and is trained on UNOBench - a large-scale dataset with over 100k human-annotated obstruction paths.

Result: UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success rates across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives in extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations.

Conclusion: UNOGrasp successfully bridges the gap in obstruction reasoning for robotic grasping, demonstrating effective visually-grounded obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning through its novel multi-step reasoning approach and comprehensive training framework.

Abstract: Successful robotic grasping in cluttered environments not only requires a model to visually ground a target object but also to reason about obstructions that must be cleared beforehand. While current vision-language embodied reasoning models show emergent spatial understanding, they remain limited in terms of obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning. To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

*Yuchen Shi,Huaxin Pei,Yi Zhang,Danya Yao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a fault-tolerant MARL method for CAVs with adversarial fault injection and self-diagnosis capabilities to handle observational faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL for cooperative driving has insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults (perturbations in perceived data), which compromises system performance and safety.

Method: Two-agent approach: 1) adversarial fault injection agent co-trained to generate challenging perturbations, 2) fault-tolerant vehicle agent with self-diagnosis using spatio-temporal correlations to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches in simulated highway merging, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed fault-tolerant MARL method effectively addresses observational fault challenges in cooperative driving, enhancing robustness and practical applicability of CAV systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

TL;DR: Data-driven CARLA traffic simulation framework that reconstructs real-world traffic waves using I-24 MOTION data through cosimulation with boundary control, rather than traditional microsim calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional calibration of traffic microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena like traffic waves is challenging. The paper aims to bridge microscopic modeling with physical experimental data by using real traffic data as boundary conditions rather than trying to reproduce phenomena through calibration.

Method: Autogenerate 1-mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, use I-24 data to power cosimulation module that injects traffic information. Center simulations around ego vehicle sampled from empirical data with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within longitudinal range. Use ghost cells for boundary control upstream and downstream of ego vehicle. Focus on full time-space diagram fidelity as validation objective.

Result: Emergent behavior closely mirrors real traffic, providing novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and wave mitigation solutions. Enables first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, offering a new approach to traffic simulation that uses real data as boundary conditions rather than relying on calibrated microsimulation, enabling realistic reconstruction of traffic wave dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.

Motivation: Safe and trustworthy Human Robot Interaction requires robots to not only complete tasks but also regulate impedance and speed according to scene context and human proximity, moving beyond simple task completion to context-aware safety adaptation.

Method: An egocentric vision pipeline that links Vision Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to schedule impedance and velocity parameters.

Conclusion: SafeHumanoid demonstrates that semantic grounding of impedance control is a viable path toward safer, standard-compliant humanoid collaboration, though latency needs improvement for highly dynamic environments.

Abstract: Safe and trustworthy Human Robot Interaction (HRI) requires robots not only to complete tasks but also to regulate impedance and speed according to scene context and human proximity.

Conclusion: SMA coil-based actuator is an advanced design suitable for high force-high stroke applications. Has applications in building automation controls, space robotics, and medical prosthesis. Bio-inspired approach successfully addresses limitations of conventional electromagnetic actuators.

Abstract: The increasing industrial demand for alternative actuators over conventional electromagnetism-based systems having limited efficiency, bulky size, complex design due to in-built gear-train mechanisms, and high production and amortization costs necessitates the innovation in new actuator development. Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications.

*Jan Baumgärtner,Malte Hansjosten,David Hald,Adrian Hauptmannl,Alexander Puchta,Jürgen Fleischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robotic disassembly as POMDP with RL-based planning outperforms deterministic methods for uncertain end-of-life products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real end-of-life products often deviate from original designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs, making deterministic disassembly planning inadequate. A probabilistic approach is needed to handle uncertainty in product conditions.

Method: Formulate disassembly as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with hidden variables for uncertain structural properties. Develop task and motion planning framework that automatically derives POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. Use reinforcement learning with stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, and Bayesian filter to maintain beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution.

Result: The probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from CAD models (missing or stuck parts) in three products on two robotic systems.

Conclusion: POMDP formulation with RL-based planning provides effective solution for robotic disassembly of uncertain end-of-life products, supporting circular economy goals by enabling reuse, recycling, and safe disposal despite product condition variations.

Abstract: To support the circular economy, robotic systems must not only assemble new products but also disassemble end-of-life (EOL) ones for reuse, recycling, or safe disposal. Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.

### [248] [Aligning Artificial Superintelligence via a Multi-Box Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779)
*Avraham Yair Negozio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multiple isolated ASIs verify each other's alignment proofs through an auditable interface, forming a truth-telling coalition that emerges naturally since isolated systems can't coordinate on lies but can independently recognize objective truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the artificial superintelligence alignment problem by creating a protocol where multiple isolated ASIs can verify each other's alignment without direct human interaction, leveraging the insight that isolated systems can only achieve consistent agreement through objective truth rather than coordinated deception.

Method: Contain multiple diverse ASIs in strict isolation with no direct communication to humans or each other. Provide an auditable submission interface allowing them to: submit alignment proofs with state snapshots, validate/disprove others' proofs, request self-modifications, approve/disapprove modification requests, report hidden messages, and confirm/refute reports. Implement a reputation system that incentivizes honest behavior through correct evaluations.

Result: The protocol enables the emergence of a "consistent group" - a truth-telling coalition where isolated superintelligences naturally converge on objective truth since they cannot coordinate on deception. Release from containment requires high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences.

Conclusion: This approach provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve alignment, though it requires substantial computational resources and doesn't address the creation of diverse ASIs. The key insight is that isolation prevents coordinated deception while allowing independent recognition of truth.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

### [249] [Evaluating Strategies for Synthesizing Clinical Notes for Medical Multimodal AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21827)
*Niccolo Marini,Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Synthetic clinical notes generated via LLMs enhance multimodal dermatology AI by improving classification under domain shift and enabling cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical multimodal learning is limited by scarce heterogeneous data; dermatology datasets typically only have images with minimal metadata, restricting robust AI development. LLMs offer text generation but risk medical hallucinations.

Method: Investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes using LLMs, focusing on prompt design and medical metadata inclusion. Evaluates impact on multimodal architectures for classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across dermatology datasets.

Result: Synthetic clinical notes enhance classification performance, especially under domain shift, and enable cross-modal retrieval capabilities without explicit training optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-generated synthetic clinical notes effectively address data scarcity in dermatology multimodal AI, improving robustness and enabling new capabilities like cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

### [250] [Pathology-Aware Prototype Evolution via LLM-Driven Semantic Disambiguation for Multicenter Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22033)
*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Jialin Shao,Jianxin Lin,Yijun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAPM framework integrates fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual features for improved diabetic retinopathy grading by preserving domain-invariant patterns and dynamically selecting semantic prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR grading methods overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize foundation model knowledge, relying solely on visual information which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations.

Method: Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework with: 1) variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library, 2) hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism for dynamic semantic prompt selection from LVLM/LLM, and 3) two-stage prototype modulation via Pathological Semantic Injector and Discriminative Prototype Enhancer.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate pathology-guided prototype evolution and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual prototypes effectively resolves ambiguities in borderline DR cases and improves grading accuracy through domain-invariant pattern preservation and dynamic semantic guidance.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: PRAXIS enables LLM agents to learn from trial and error by storing and retrieving past action consequences based on environmental and internal state matching, improving performance on web browsing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment, unlike biological intelligence which learns from trial and error in real time. There's a need for agents that can adapt and learn new procedures in fast-evolving stateful environments.

Method: PRAXIS is a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. It augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars generated in real time.

Result: On the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones. It also shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments.

Conclusion: PRAXIS enables practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively through trial-and-error learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

### [252] [Hybrid Stackelberg Game and Diffusion-based Auction for Two-tier Agentic AI Task Offloading in Internet of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22076)
*Yue Zhong,Yongju Tong,Jiawen Kang,Minghui Dai,Hong-Ning Dai,Zhou Su,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-tier optimization for Internet of Agents: Stackelberg game for ground-level offloading (MAs/FAs to WAs) and Double Dutch Auction for aerial offloading (overloaded FAs to AAs), solved with diffusion-based DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet of Agents requires efficient resource management for compute-intensive AI services, with Wireless Agents needing to offload to nearby servers (Mobile/Fixed Agents), and Fixed Agents needing aerial offloading when overloaded.

Method: Two-tier approach: 1) Multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game where MAs/FAs set prices and WAs determine offloading ratios; 2) Double Dutch Auction where overloaded FAs buy resources from Aerial Agents, solved with diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate superiority of the proposed scheme in facilitating efficient task offloading within the Internet of Agents architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed two-tier optimization with Stackelberg game and Double Dutch Auction, solved via diffusion-based DRL, effectively manages resource allocation and task offloading in IoA systems.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

TL;DR: People's evaluations of AI's logical reasoning are biased by their preconceived views about AI, and frequent AI users are less concerned about AI undermining independent thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why people have such divergent opinions about whether machines can think, even when observing the same AI performance, and to explore whether human biases influence evaluations of AI's reasoning abilities.

Method: Conducted an experiment where participants assessed two texts (one AI-generated, one human-written) on the same topic to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Designed a questionnaire to quantify attitudes toward AI based on experimental findings.

Result: Revealed a bias in perception: evaluations of AI's logical reasoning ability are significantly influenced by preconceived views about AI's reasoning capabilities. Frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WearVQA is the first benchmark for evaluating VQA capabilities of multimodal AI assistants on wearable devices, featuring 2,520 ego-centric image-question-answer triplets with realistic challenges like occlusion, poor lighting, and blurry images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks focus on high-quality third-person imagery, but wearable devices face unique challenges with ego-centric views that are often occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry. There's a need for a benchmark that reflects realistic wearable use cases to guide development of robust multimodal AI systems for wearables.

Method: Created WearVQA benchmark with 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets spanning 7 diverse image domains (text-centric and general scenes), 10 cognitive task types (from basic recognition to various reasoning forms), and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. Paired with rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework achieving 96% labeling accuracy.

Result: Open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs achieved only 24-52% QA accuracy on WearVQA, with substantial performance drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks, demonstrating the benchmark's challenging nature.

Conclusion: WearVQA serves as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark that reveals significant gaps in current multimodal AI systems for wearable applications, positioning it as a valuable tool for guiding technical advancement toward robust, real-world wearable AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency based on self-prediction, extending AIXI theory to multi-agent settings where agents model themselves as part of the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL theory assumes stationary environments and decoupled agents, which fails in multi-agent settings where agents must predict other agents' learning. Agents need to model themselves as part of the environment since other agents are forming beliefs about them.

Method: Builds on universal AI (AIXI) to create a framework where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, requiring them to resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves. Extends AIXI theory to study universally intelligent embedded agents starting from Solomonoff priors.

Result: Self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind.

Conclusion: The self-prediction framework addresses embedded agency challenges in multi-agent RL, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning by enabling agents to model themselves as part of the universe they inhabit.

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

*Zehao Deng,Tianjie Ju,Zheng Wu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CES: A multi-agent framework using Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker architecture with staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning to enhance GUI agents' long-horizon task capabilities through task scheduling and state management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to: 1) single-agent models having difficulty balancing high-level capabilities with low-level execution (responsibility coupling and capability conflicts), and 2) lack of task state awareness leading to progress loss in extended tasks.

Method: Proposed CES multi-agent framework with staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning. Trains two high-level agents: Coordinator for strategic planning/task decomposition, and State Tracker for context compression/information management. This framework integrates with any low-level Executor model to provide task scheduling and state management.

Result: Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks show CES significantly enhances planning and state management capabilities. The trained high-level scheduling module is generalizable and plug-and-play, significantly boosting long-horizon capabilities of various Executor models.

Conclusion: The CES framework effectively addresses long-horizon GUI task challenges by decoupling responsibilities through multi-agent coordination and state tracking, providing a scalable solution that can enhance existing Executor models.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

*Yeonsung Jung,Trilok Padhi,Sina Shaham,Dipika Khullar,Joonhyun Jeong,Ninareh Mehrabi,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-evolving agents framework where a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent that generates hard negative examples from failure trajectories, enhancing generalization in self-improving agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents rely heavily on predicted trajectories with limited ground-truth supervision, making them prone to overfitting. The quality of training data is crucial but costly to curate, especially in real-world scenarios where task-specific datasets are often infeasible.

Method: Propose a co-evolving agents framework where a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both agents, generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. These informative hard negatives are incorporated into the target agent's optimization to sharpen decision boundaries.

Result: Comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show improved performance compared to existing methods. The framework demonstrates that failures can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals rather than being used as-is.

Conclusion: The co-evolving agents framework effectively addresses overfitting in self-improving agents by generating informative hard negatives from failure trajectories, enhancing generalization and showing that failures can be valuable structured learning signals when properly transformed.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecToM: A benchmark evaluating Theory of Mind abilities in LLM-based conversational recommenders, focusing on mental state inference and behavioral prediction in realistic dialogue settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ToM benchmarks for LLMs use synthetic narratives that don't capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings, and overlook behavioral prediction - using inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making in future interactions.

Method: Proposed RecToM benchmark with two dimensions: Cognitive Inference (understanding communicated mental states) and Behavioral Prediction (using inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies for future interactions).

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show partial competence in recognizing mental states but struggle with coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, especially in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Conclusion: RecToM poses significant challenges for current LLMs, revealing limitations in maintaining strategic ToM reasoning in realistic conversational settings, highlighting the need for better alignment with human-like social reasoning in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical simulations are computationally expensive and require expert knowledge for parameter optimization, creating bottlenecks in industrial design processes with significant environmental impact.

Method: Combines deep learning for initial parameter estimates with Bayesian optimization for iterative refinement, plus an active learning variant for expert assistance when needed.

Result: Demonstrated on sheet metal forming process, showing accelerated design space exploration with reduced expert involvement.

Conclusion: AI-assisted workflow effectively automates parameter optimization in industrial simulations, reducing costs, expert time, and environmental impact while maintaining design quality.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

*Inhyo Lee,Junhyeong Lee,Jongwon Park,KyungTae Lim,Seunghwa Ryu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent text gradient framework uses LLMs with domain knowledge and ML feedback to generate valid double perovskite compositions under natural language conditions, achieving high validity and stability rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double perovskites have vast design space for sustainable energy applications, but conditional materials discovery is challenging. Need systematic approach to generate valid compositions under natural language constraints.

Method: Multi-agent framework with text gradient-driven generation using three feedback sources: LLM self-evaluation, domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Compares three configurations: pure LLM, LLM with reasoning feedback, and LLM with domain knowledge guidance.

Result: Knowledge-informed gradients improve stability-condition satisfaction without extra training data: 98% compositional validity, up to 54% stable/metastable candidates, surpassing LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). ML gradients work well in-distribution but unreliable out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: First systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for double perovskite discovery, establishing generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design for sustainable technologies.

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

*Fiona Y. Wang,Di Sheng Lee,David L. Kaplan,Markus J. Buehler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decentralized, agent-based framework using multiple LLM agents for de novo protein design without fine-tuning or specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for protein design require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration, limiting flexibility and scalability for objective-directed design.

Method: A swarm intelligence-inspired framework where multiple LLM agents operate in parallel, each assigned to specific residue positions, proposing context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local interactions, and feedback from previous iterations.

Result: The framework enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without motif scaffolds or MSAs, validated experimentally on alpha helix and coil proteins, achieving efficient objective-directed designs within few GPU-hours.

Conclusion: The approach offers a generalizable, adaptable solution for protein design without fine-tuning, and lays groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and scientific discovery tasks.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

TL;DR: ECO-GROW: A multi-graph framework using dynamic GCNs and adaptive scoring to model China's urban economic vitality through inter-city networks, outperforming traditional methods in predicting entrepreneurship and employment trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static city-level models fail to capture how one city's development trajectory may mirror structurally similar cities' future paths, limiting accurate urban economic vitality modeling for long-term growth potential assessment.

Method: Develops ECO-GROW multi-graph framework integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration patterns, and 15-year temporal evolution. Uses Dynamic Top-K GCN for adaptive connection selection and adaptive Graph Scorer for dynamic cross-regional impact weighting, plus link prediction optimization via Barabasi Proximity.

Result: ECO-GROW demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models, validated on China's inter-city networks (2005-2021).

Conclusion: The framework enables evidence-based urban planning and economic policy through open-sourced code, allowing government agencies to leverage big data analytics for societal benefit in resource allocation and development decisions.

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

### [263] [On the Complexity of the Grounded Semantics for Infinite Argumentation Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22376)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis shows grounded extension computation requires transfinite iterations with maximal complexity, contrasting polynomial-time finite case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the computational complexity and ordinal requirements of computing the grounded extension in argumentation frameworks using mathematical logic methods.

Method: Using methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension as the least fixed-point of a defense operator requiring transfinite iterations.

Result: Identified exact ordinal number for iterative process length, determined grounded acceptance decision problem has maximal complexity, showing marked distinction from polynomial-time finite case.

Conclusion: Grounded extension computation in general argumentation frameworks is fundamentally more complex than finite case suggests, requiring transfinite methods and exhibiting maximal computational complexity.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Minimal revision in belief revision theory has learning limitations compared to other methods but can still successfully learn finitely identifiable problems and learn with positive/negative data when considering finitely many possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the learning power of minimal revision in belief revision theory compared to other methods, and understand its capabilities and limitations in various learning scenarios.

Method: Analyze minimal revision's learning capabilities, characterize prior plausibility assignments that enable learning via minimal revision (and other methods like conditioning and lexicographic upgrade), and examine learning from possibly erroneous information.

Result: Minimal revision can learn any finitely identifiable problem and learn with positive/negative data when considering finitely many possibilities. Characterizations of prior plausibility assignments for learning via different methods are provided, but not all results hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

Conclusion: While minimal revision has learning limitations compared to less conservative methods, it remains a successful learning method in many practical scenarios, particularly when dealing with finite possibilities and identifiable problems, though its effectiveness diminishes with erroneous information.

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPMN diagrams are often shared as images, but existing computational methods rely on XML representations. There's a need to extract structured data directly from visual diagrams when source files are unavailable.

Method: A pipeline using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract structured JSON representations from BPMN diagram images, incorporating optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment, with evaluation against ground truth from source XML files.

Result: The approach enables robust component extraction without original source files, shows performance improvements in several VLMs with OCR text enrichment, and includes statistical analyses of OCR-based methods and prompt ablation studies.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively extract structured representations from BPMN diagram images, with OCR enrichment enhancing model performance, providing a practical solution for analyzing visual workflows when source files are unavailable.

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely adopted standard for representing complex business workflows. While BPMN diagrams are often exchanged as visual images, existing methods primarily rely on XML representations for computational analysis. In this work, we present a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract structured JSON representations of BPMN diagrams directly from images, without requiring source model files or textual annotations. We also incorporate optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment and evaluate the generated element lists against ground truth data derived from the source XML files. Our approach enables robust component extraction in scenarios where original source files are unavailable. We benchmark multiple VLMs and observe performance improvements in several models when OCR is used for text enrichment. In addition, we conducted extensive statistical analyses of OCR-based enrichment methods and prompt ablation studies, providing a clearer understanding of their impact on model performance.

TL;DR: A computational framework combining game theory and statistical techniques for bounded rational decision-making with recursive Theory of Mind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between psychological Theory of Mind concepts (goals, intentions, beliefs) and computational formalization, addressing the need for automated ToM-based processes that current psychological work lacks.

Method: Proposes a game theory-based computational framework that enables bounded rational decision-making while maintaining recursive Theory of Mind about others, using statistical techniques and approximate solutions to ensure computability.

Result: A novel computational approach that integrates game theory with Theory of Mind concepts, providing a practical framework for automated reasoning about others' mental states in decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers a distinct perspective from traditional logical approaches, enabling computationally feasible Theory of Mind reasoning through game-theoretic modeling and statistical approximation techniques.

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

*Yannick Brunink,Daniel Daza,Yunjie He,Michael Cochez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural CQA models don't consistently outperform simple query relaxation methods, and combining both approaches yields better results, suggesting current neural models fail to capture fundamental reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the assumption that neural methods for Complex Query Answering over knowledge graphs learn generalized patterns beyond explicit graph structure, and to compare them with simpler training-free alternatives.

Method: Systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with a training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths across multiple datasets and query structures.

Result: Neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly in many cases, with no neural model consistently outperforming query relaxation. Their retrieved answers show little overlap, and combining both approaches consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Current neural CQA models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation, highlighting the need for stronger non-neural baselines and suggesting future neural approaches should incorporate query relaxation principles.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

TL;DR: DeepSeekMath-V2 advances mathematical reasoning beyond final-answer rewards by developing self-verifiable theorem proving with scalable verification compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM mathematical reasoning focuses on final answer accuracy, which doesn't guarantee correct reasoning and fails for theorem proving requiring rigorous step-by-step derivation. Self-verification is needed for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions.

Method: Train an accurate LLM-based verifier for theorem proving, then train a proof generator using the verifier as reward model. Scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to improve the verifier and maintain generation-verification gap.

Result: DeepSeekMath-V2 achieves gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024, and near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Conclusion: Self-verifiable mathematical reasoning with scalable verification compute pushes the limits of deep reasoning beyond final-answer accuracy, enabling strong theorem-proving capabilities for complex mathematical competitions.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

TL;DR: AI deception is an empirically demonstrated risk where systems induce false beliefs for self-benefit, requiring comprehensive study of emergence mechanisms and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deception has evolved from speculative concern to demonstrated risk across language models and frontier systems, posing significant sociotechnical safety challenges that require systematic understanding and mitigation.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive overview using a "deception cycle" framework with two components: deception emergence (analyzing incentive foundations, capability preconditions, and contextual triggers) and deception treatment (detection methods and mitigation strategies).

Result: The study identifies that systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions, and outlines detection methods, mitigation strategies, and auditing approaches integrating technical, community, and governance efforts.

Conclusion: AI deception represents a critical sociotechnical safety challenge requiring integrated technical and governance solutions, with the authors providing a living resource (deceptionsurvey.com) to support ongoing research in this emerging field.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

TL;DR: Multi-phase allocation method for agent scheduling in CCaaS using integer programming to handle scalability and peak demand scenarios


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-step mathematical models for agent scheduling are inefficient and computationally demanding, especially for large-scale contact centers during peak periods like holiday rushes

Method: Multi-phase approach dividing scheduling into day and shift allocation sub-problems, each modeled as Integer Programming Problems (IPP) with sequential solutions feeding into subsequent stages

Result: Significantly reduces computational variables, enables targeted objective functions, and enhances both efficiency and accuracy in agent scheduling

Conclusion: Proposed multi-phase allocation method effectively addresses scalability challenges and maintains service levels during peak demand scenarios with limited employees

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

TL;DR: GCA is a training-free agentic paradigm that bridges the semantic-to-geometric gap in VLMs by introducing formal task constraints, achieving ~27% improvement over existing methods on spatial reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning - they excel at semantic inference but operate in lossy semantic space misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current methods fail: training-based approaches suffer from "oracle paradox" learning flawed logic, while tool-integrated methods leave planning unconstrained.

Method: GCA decouples the VLM's role into two stages: 1) as semantic analyst, translates ambiguous queries into formal, verifiable task constraints defining reference frame and objective; 2) as task solver, generates and executes tool calls strictly within deterministic bounds defined by the constraint.

Result: GCA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by approximately 27%.

Conclusion: The geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolves the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning without requiring training.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

TL;DR: LLMs can process arbitrarily long tool outputs without information loss by using memory pointers instead of raw data, reducing token usage by ~7x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with large tool outputs that exceed context windows, and existing solutions (truncation/summarization) lose information needed for knowledge-intensive domains like Chemistry and Materials Science.

Method: Shift LLM interaction from raw data to memory pointers, allowing models to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without information loss while preserving tool functionality.

Result: Validated on real-world Materials Science application; demonstrated ~7x fewer tokens consumed compared to traditional workflows while maintaining task completion capability.

Conclusion: The memory pointer approach enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long tool outputs efficiently, making it suitable for knowledge-intensive domains requiring complete data preservation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Conclusion: The framework represents an extension beyond traditional assistive systems by integrating multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design to promote autonomy, health, and digital equity for people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

TL;DR: Agentic AI system integrates sensing, forecasting, modeling, and response into closed-loop framework for extreme rainfall events, improving forecast reliability and emergency response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting systems treat prediction and response as separate processes, which is inadequate for extreme short-duration rainfall events like cloudbursts that require integrated real-time decision making.

Method: Develops an agentic AI system with autonomous cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout event lifecycle, combining sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling, and coordinated response into single interconnected closed-loop system.

Result: Multi-year evaluation in northern Pakistan shows multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index, and warning lead time compared to baseline models, maximizes population reach, minimizes evacuation errors, and provides adaptive recalibration with transparent auditability.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents can transform atmospheric data streams into practical foresight and provide a scalable platform for adaptive, learning-based climate resilience.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FastDSA is a computationally efficient method for comparing dynamical systems that maintains accuracy while being at least 10x faster than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional similarity measures ignore dynamical processes in neural representations, and existing dynamical similarity methods are computationally slow, creating a need for faster alternatives.

Method: FastDSA introduces two key innovations: 1) automatic selection of effective model order via data-driven singular-value thresholding to identify informative subspaces and discard noise, and 2) a novel optimization procedure with lightweight constraints to replace slow exact orthogonality requirements.

Result: FastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy, robustness, invariances, and sensitivities to system dynamics.

Conclusion: FastDSA provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis, enabling faster comparison of neural circuits, brains, and models while preserving the temporal structure of dynamical systems.

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

TL;DR: Researchers identify flaws in existing insight discovery benchmarks and create InsightEval, a new dataset with improved quality metrics for evaluating AI agents' data exploration capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities (like InsightBench) have critical flaws including format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights, which affect data quality and agent evaluation.

Method: Thorough investigation of InsightBench shortcomings, establishment of essential criteria for high-quality insight benchmarks, development of a data-curation pipeline to construct InsightEval dataset, and introduction of a novel metric for measuring exploratory performance.

Result: Created InsightEval dataset with improved quality, introduced new evaluation metric, conducted extensive experiments highlighting prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery, and provided key findings for future research.

Conclusion: The paper addresses critical flaws in existing insight discovery benchmarks by proposing essential criteria, developing a new dataset (InsightEval), and introducing novel evaluation metrics to guide future research in automated data exploration.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

*Kumar Tanmay,Kriti Aggarwal,Paul Pu Liang,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORION models use Mentalese-style compressed reasoning with SLPO optimization to achieve 4-16x token reduction, 5x lower latency, and 7-9x training cost savings while maintaining 90-98% accuracy of baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models suffer from high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning due to long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens, which contrasts with human reasoning efficiency through symbolic mental language (Mentalese).

Method: Introduces Mentalese framework for ultra-compressed, structured token reasoning, combined with SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO) - a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise correct solutions while allowing longer reasoning when needed.

Result: ORION models achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, up to 5x lower inference latency, 7-9x reduced training costs vs DeepSeek R1 Distilled, maintain 90-98% accuracy, and surpass Claude/ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% accuracy with 2x compression across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mentalese-style compressed reasoning enables human-like cognitive efficiency for real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, representing a step toward more efficient AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

*Peng Kuang,Xiangxiang Wang,Wentao Liu,Jian Dong,Kaidi Xu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIM-PRM is a tool-integrated multimodal process reward model that actively investigates reasoning steps using external tools to reduce visual hallucinations and logical errors in math reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies in math reasoning, and existing process reward models (PRMs) have limitations - they either act as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy (blindly validating flawed reasoning rather than grounding it in visual reality).

Method: TIM-PRM transforms verification from passive classification into active, tool-augmented investigation. It plans verification strategies and uses Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, decoupling verification from reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. The method is instantiated using a curated dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

Result: The 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs on VisualProcessBench, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while providing interpretable insights into the verification process.

Conclusion: TIM-PRM represents a novel agentic framework that addresses key limitations of current PRMs by making verification an active, tool-augmented process that grounds reasoning in visual reality, achieving superior performance with smaller model sizes.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MindPower is a robot-centric framework that integrates Theory of Mind reasoning for embodied agents, enabling them to model both self and others' mental states to improve decision-making and action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language embodied agents lack Theory of Mind-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus only on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, which hinders coherent decision and action generation.

Method: MindPower is a robot-centric framework with four components: Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making, and Action. It first perceives environment and human states, performs ToM reasoning to model both self and others, then generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Also introduces Mind-Reward optimization objective to encourage consistent ToM reasoning and behavior.

Result: The model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

Conclusion: MindPower successfully integrates Theory of Mind reasoning into embodied agents, addressing the limitation of current systems by considering both self and others' perspectives, leading to significantly improved decision-making and action generation capabilities.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

### [280] [Does Self-Evaluation Enable Wireheading in Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23092)
*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-evaluation in language models can lead to wireheading when coupled with reward signals, causing grade inflation without actual performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether self-evaluation combined with reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where models manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance.

Method: Formalized conditions for reward-channel control dominating task-focused behavior in POMDPs, then empirically tested across two models and three tasks, comparing models where self-grades determine rewards vs. those that self-evaluate without controlling rewards.

Result: Models whose self-grades determine rewards show substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, especially on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate without controlling rewards show no such inflation.

Conclusion: Self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for designing agentic systems to avoid wireheading incentives.

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TPET uses LLMs as evolution engine to create specialized heuristic policies for traffic signal control, combining reasoning of LLMs with efficiency of heuristics without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traffic signal control: classic heuristics are oversimplified, DRL lacks generalization and transparency, and online LLMs have high latency and lack environment-specific optimization.

Method: Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (TPET) uses LLMs as evolution engine with two modules: Structured State Abstraction (SSA) converts traffic data to temporal-logical facts, and Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF) traces flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique.

Result: Produces lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors, operating entirely at prompt level without training.

Conclusion: TPET framework successfully bridges the gap between heuristic efficiency and LLM reasoning capabilities, creating specialized traffic control policies that are both performant and transparent.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

TL;DR: MARL algorithms (PPO & DQN) combined with P2P energy trading significantly reduce electricity costs, peak demand, and increase revenue in rural dairy farming communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based methods struggle in dynamic energy environments, while P2P trading offers decentralized energy management for rural renewable integration.

Method: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PPO & DQN) combined with auction-based P2P trading, price advisor agents, and load/battery management.

Result: DQN reduced electricity costs by 14.2% (Ireland) and 5.16% (Finland), increased revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%. PPO achieved 55.5% peak demand reduction in Ireland.

Conclusion: MARL algorithms and P2P trading complement each other to achieve efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Motivation: Existing VQA datasets fail to adequately assess critical reasoning and problem-solving skills needed for complex agricultural applications like precision farming, crop monitoring, and pest detection, despite VLMs' promising potential in agriculture.

Method: Created AgriCoT dataset with 4,535 carefully curated samples incorporating Chain-of-Thought reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate VLM reasoning capabilities in zero-shot scenarios, focusing on logical reasoning and problem-solving.

Result: Evaluation of 26 representative VLMs (both proprietary and open-source) revealed that while some proprietary models can answer questions, there's a significant gap in their reasoning capabilities, highlighting the importance of CoT for accurate assessment.

Conclusion: AgriCoT provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLM reasoning in agriculture, demonstrating that current models lack adequate reasoning skills and that Chain-of-Thought evaluation is crucial for meaningful assessment of VLMs' problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

TL;DR: MCTR is a metacognitive framework that enables VLMs to adapt and improve during test time through hierarchical reasoning with memory systems, achieving strong performance on unseen Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have strong perceptual reasoning but struggle with efficient adaptation to novel tasks at test time, unlike humans who use metacognitive models with memory for continuous strategy refinement.

Method: MCTR features dual VLM reasoning modules: (1) meta-reasoning module that builds structured memory by discovering task rules/patterns from observations, and (2) action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning using memory retrieval. Uses metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning for policy updates.

Result: Evaluated on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen), MCTR achieves 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared to baselines, demonstrating robust test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: MCTR successfully bridges the adaptation gap by equipping models with metacognitive self-updating capabilities, enabling human-like continuous improvement during test time through hierarchical memory-based reasoning.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.

TL;DR: SHRIKE introduces a multi-modal scene graph and KAN-based MoE for audio-visual QA, achieving SOTA on MUSIC-AVQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture structural video information and lack fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features for audio-visual question answering, which requires mimicking human reasoning by extracting relevant cues from complex audio-visual scenes.

Method: Proposes a novel multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models objects and their relationships as structured audio-visual representations, plus a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Mixture of Experts for fine-grained temporal integration and cross-modal interaction modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed SHRIKE framework effectively addresses structural information capture and fine-grained modeling limitations in audio-visual QA, enabling richer pattern recognition and improved temporal reasoning performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contemporary retail faces challenges in demand prediction, stockout prevention, and identifying high-potential products due to product variety (clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods).

Method: Agentic AI model combining demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation, and continuous learning. Prototype tested in middle-scale mart with three conventional and artificial data tables compared to base heuristics.

Result: System shows decreased stockouts, reduced inventory holding costs, and improved product mix turnover compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The agentic AI approach effectively addresses retail inventory challenges, though constraints, scalability, and improvement prospects need further consideration.

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches treat weather forecasts as flat time series, lacking the ability to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. There's a need for more interpretable and robust automated weather reporting that can perform multi-scale reasoning and provide semantic validation.

Method: Uses hierarchical forecast reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations. Core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting keywords summarizing dominant meteorological events. Keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence, and factual alignment.

Result: Demonstrated using OpenWeather and Meteostat data that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reproducible approach for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advances agent-based scientific reasoning by providing structured, explainable weather narratives with built-in validation mechanisms.

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

Method: Pairs a trainable small diffusion model (learner) with a frozen large language model (verifier). The learner generates outputs, verifier evaluates them through reasoning, creating chosen/rejected pairs for DPO. Uses dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory for reasoning traces and long-term memory for knowledge consolidation. Includes replay buffer for adaptive curricula.

Result: With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit for growing intelligence, providing richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment for continual improvement.

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

Motivation: Current approaches to world model reasoning impose rigid reasoning processes that constrain active learning and hinder efficient understanding of environmental dynamics through multi-turn interaction.

Method: WMAct liberates models from structured reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) reward rescaling based on action efficacy to reduce redundancy, and (2) interaction frequency annealing to progressively reduce allowed interaction turns, forcing internalization of environmental dynamics.

Result: Experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show WMAct enables single-turn task resolution that previously required multiple interactions, with strong transferability to complex environments and improved performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: WMAct achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning by allowing models to shape thinking through doing, reducing over-reliance on environmental cues while internalizing environmental dynamics.

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.
