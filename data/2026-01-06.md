### [1] [Free Energy-Based Modeling of Emotional Dynamics in Video Advertisements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00812)
*Takashi Ushio,Kazuhiro Onishi,Hideyoshi Yanagisawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantifying emotional responses in ads using free energy principle metrics (KLD, BS, UN) from video features alone, without external signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create explainable emotion estimation for advertising videos without needing physiological signals or subjective ratings, using only video features.

Method: Applied free energy principle to quantify pleasantness, surprise, and habituation from scene-level expression features. Used Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) for prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) for belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) for prior ambiguity. Tested on 1,059 food ads and validated across different ad genres/durations.

Result: KLD reflected pleasantness with brand presentation; BS captured surprise from informational complexity; UN reflected surprise from uncertainty in element types/spatial arrangements. Identified three emotional patterns: uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak/decay. Results robust across hyperparameters and generalized to different ad types.

Conclusion: Free energy principle metrics can effectively quantify emotional responses in ads using only video features, providing explainable emotion estimation without external data. Method shows promise for guiding creation of more engaging advertising content.

Abstract: Emotional responses during advertising video viewing are recognized as essential for understanding media effects because they have influenced attention, memory, and purchase intention. To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified "pleasantness," "surprise," and "habituation" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected "pleasantness" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured "surprise" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected "surprise" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.

### [2] [Can Generative Models Actually Forge Realistic Identity Documents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00829)
*Alexander Vinogradov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current generative AI models can create visually convincing ID document forgeries but fail to achieve forensic-level authenticity needed to bypass verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing public concerns about potential misuse of advanced generative image models for creating realistic identity document forgeries that could bypass verification systems.

Method: Evaluated text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipelines using multiple publicly available diffusion-based models (Stable Diffusion, Qwen, Flux, Nano-Banana, etc.) to test their ability to produce identity document forgeries.

Result: Current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics but fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity needed to realistically bypass human or automated verification systems.

Conclusion: The risk of generative identity document deepfakes achieving forensic-level authenticity may be overestimated, highlighting the importance of collaboration between ML practitioners and document-forensics experts for realistic risk assessment.

Abstract: Generative image models have recently shown significant progress in image realism, leading to public concerns about their potential misuse for document forgery. This paper explores whether contemporary open-source and publicly accessible diffusion-based generative models can produce identity document forgeries that could realistically bypass human or automated verification systems. We evaluate text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipelines using multiple publicly available generative model families, including Stable Diffusion, Qwen, Flux, Nano-Banana, and others. The findings indicate that while current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics, they fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity. Consequently, the risk of generative identity document deepfakes achieving forensic-level authenticity may be overestimated, underscoring the value of collaboration between machine learning practitioners and document-forensics experts in realistic risk assessment.

### [4] [Unified Review and Benchmark of Deep Segmentation Architectures for Cardiac Ultrasound on CAMUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00839)
*Zahid Ullah,Muhammad Hilal,Eunsoo Lee,Dragan Pamucar,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmark study comparing U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet on cardiac ultrasound segmentation with standardized preprocessing and evaluation on CAMUS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many reviews summarize cardiac imaging and deep learning advances, there's a lack of unified, reproducible experimental benchmarks connecting these overviews to practical implementations.

Method: Combined literature review with controlled comparison of three architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, TransUNet) on CAMUS dataset. Tested multiple preprocessing routes: native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled cine frames. Used identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria.

Result: Plain U-Net achieved 94% mean Dice on native NIfTI data, PNG workflow reached 91%. Attention U-Net improved small/low-contrast region segmentation and reduced boundary leakage. TransUNet showed strongest generalization on challenging frames due to global context modeling, especially with SSL initialization. Pseudo-labeling improved robustness after confidence filtering.

Conclusion: Provides three contributions: 1) harmonized benchmark of three architectures under standardized preprocessing/evaluation, 2) practical guidance on ultrasound data preparation, and 3) outlook on scalable self-supervision and multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling and quality assurance.

Abstract: Several review papers summarize cardiac imaging and DL advances, few works connect this overview to a unified and reproducible experimental benchmark. In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling, quality assurance, and targeted dataset curation.

### [5] [Motion-Compensated Latent Semantic Canvases for Visual Situational Awareness on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00854)
*Igor Lodin,Sergii Filatov,Vira Filatova,Dmytro Filatov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCLSC reduces segmentation workload on edge devices by using motion-gated inference and persistent semantic canvases, achieving 30x fewer segmentation calls and 20x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable visual situational awareness on resource-constrained edge devices by reducing the computational burden of expensive panoptic segmentation while maintaining semantic understanding.

Method: Maintains two latent semantic canvases (static and dynamic layers) in a stabilized baseline coordinate frame. Uses motion-gated inference where expensive segmentation (Mask2Former) only runs when motion indicates new information, with motion compensation preserving coordinate consistency.

Result: On 480p clips, reduces segmentation calls by >30x and lowers mean end-to-end processing time by >20x compared to naive per-frame segmentation, while maintaining coherent semantic overlays.

Conclusion: MCLSC enables efficient visual situational awareness on edge devices through motion-gated segmentation and persistent semantic memory, dramatically reducing computational requirements while preserving semantic coherence.

Abstract: We propose Motion-Compensated Latent Semantic Canvases (MCLSC) for visual situational awareness on resource-constrained edge devices. The core idea is to maintain persistent semantic metadata in two latent canvases - a slowly accumulating static layer and a rapidly updating dynamic layer - defined in a baseline coordinate frame stabilized from the video stream. Expensive panoptic segmentation (Mask2Former) runs asynchronously and is motion-gated: inference is triggered only when motion indicates new information, while stabilization/motion compensation preserves a consistent coordinate system for latent semantic memory. On prerecorded 480p clips, our prototype reduces segmentation calls by >30x and lowers mean end-to-end processing time by >20x compared to naive per-frame segmentation, while maintaining coherent static/dynamic semantic overlays.

### [6] [VL-OrdinalFormer: Vision Language Guided Ordinal Transformers for Interpretable Knee Osteoarthritis Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00879)
*Zahid Ullah,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLOrdinalFormer is a vision-language framework that combines ViT backbone with CLIP semantic alignment and ordinal regression for automated knee osteoarthritis grading, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging early-stage classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability, but current radiographic grading (especially distinguishing KL1 and KL2 stages) suffers from subtle distinctions and high inter-observer variability among radiologists, necessitating more accurate and automated assessment tools.

Method: VLOrdinalFormer combines ViT-L16 backbone with CORAL-based ordinal regression and CLIP-driven semantic alignment to incorporate clinical textual concepts (joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis). Uses stratified 5-fold cross-validation, class-aware reweighting for intermediate grades, and test-time augmentation with global threshold optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OAI kneeKL224 dataset, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Shows substantial gains for challenging KL1 and KL2 grades without compromising mild/severe case accuracy. Interpretability analyses confirm attention to clinically relevant anatomical regions.

Conclusion: Vision-language aligned ordinal transformers show potential as reliable, interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiology, addressing critical challenges in early-stage osteoarthritis diagnosis.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and accurate severity assessment using the Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grading system is critical for clinical decision making. However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.

### [7] [VideoCuRL: Video Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Orthogonal Difficulty Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00887)
*Hongbo Jin,Kuanwei Lin,Wenhao Zhang,Yichen Jin,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCuRL: A 2D curriculum RL framework for VideoLLMs that decomposes difficulty into visual perception load and cognitive reasoning depth, using efficient proxies and novel training strategies to improve performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL paradigms for VideoLLMs rely on random data shuffling or naive scalar difficulty metrics, which fail to disentangle the orthogonal challenges of visual temporal perception load and cognitive reasoning depth in video understanding.

Method: Proposes VideoCuRL with: 1) 2D curriculum decomposition using optical flow/keyframe entropy for visual complexity and Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity; 2) Competence aware Diagonal Wavefront training strategy; 3) Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training.

Result: Outperforms strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks, while eliminating prohibitive inference overhead of generation-based curricula.

Conclusion: VideoCuRL offers a scalable solution for robust video post-training by effectively disentangling and addressing the dual challenges of visual perception and cognitive reasoning in VideoLLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for empowering VideoLLMs with complex spatiotemporal reasoning. However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training against reward collapse and catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that VideoCuRL surpasses strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks. Notably, VideoCuRL eliminates the prohibitive inference overhead of generation-based curricula, offering a scalable solution for robust video post-training.

### [8] [Comparative Evaluation of CNN Architectures for Neural Style Transfer in Indonesian Batik Motif Generation: A Comprehensive Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00888)
*Happy Gery Pangestu,Andi Prademon Yunus,Siti Khomsah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of CNN backbones for Neural Style Transfer on Indonesian batik shows ResNet architectures offer 5-6x faster convergence and 16x fewer FLOPs than VGG while maintaining similar structural preservation, making them practical for resource-limited deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VGG-based NST approaches for Indonesian batik preservation are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting practical deployment in resource-limited environments. Need to find more efficient alternatives.

Method: Comparative analysis of five CNN backbones (VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, ResNet101) through 245 controlled experiments using quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis (ANOVA on SSIM).

Result: No statistically significant differences in structural preservation (SSIM p=0.83), but ResNet achieves 5-6x faster convergence, 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs), similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS=0.53). VGG produces denser textures, ResNet preserves geometric stability and canting strokes.

Conclusion: Architectural choice in NST should shift from maximizing stylistic intensity to efficiency-aware deployment. ResNet-based backbones provide practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) provides a computational framework for the digital preservation and generative exploration of Indonesian batik motifs; however, existing approaches remain largely centered on VGG-based architectures whose strong stylistic expressiveness comes at the cost of high computational and memory demands, that limits practical deployment in resource-limited environments. This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.

### [9] [CornViT: A Multi-Stage Convolutional Vision Transformer Framework for Hierarchical Corn Kernel Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00897)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Jane Mascarenhas,Lior Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CornViT: A three-stage Vision Transformer framework for automated corn kernel grading that achieves 91-94% accuracy across purity, morphology, and embryo orientation tasks, outperforming CNN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual corn kernel grading is labor-intensive and subjective. There's a need for automated, accurate systems for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding applications.

Method: Three-stage hierarchical CvT-13 framework: Stage 1 (purity classification), Stage 2 (morphology: flat vs round), Stage 3 (embryo orientation: up vs down). Uses ImageNet-pretrained CvT-13 with head-only fine-tuning on curated datasets.

Result: Achieved 93.76% purity accuracy, 94.11% morphology accuracy, and 91.12% embryo orientation accuracy. Outperformed ResNet-50 (76-81%) and DenseNet-121 (86-89%). Released datasets and deployed as Flask web application.

Conclusion: CornViT demonstrates superior performance for corn kernel grading, showing advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention. The framework, datasets, and web app provide a deployable solution for seed quality workflows.

Abstract: Accurate grading of corn kernels is critical for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding, yet it is still predominantly performed by manual inspection. This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows. Source code and data are publicly available.

*Eliot Park,Abhi Kumar,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5) show improved contextual understanding for recyclability prediction but still have limitations in handling location-specific rules, contamination, and multi-material objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recyclability determination is complex for the public, creating a need for automated solutions to improve recycling practices and environmental sustainability.

Method: Evaluated cutting-edge vision-language models using curated image datasets to predict recyclability, assess bin fit, and test performance on location-specific guidelines, contamination/damage, and multi-material objects.

Result: Models show significant advancements in contextual understanding compared to previous versions, but still fall short in handling complex scenarios like location-specific rules, contamination, and multi-material composition.

Conclusion: Continued refinement of context-aware vision-language models is crucial for enhancing public recycling practices and advancing environmental sustainability.

Abstract: While the importance of efficient recycling is widely acknowledged, accurately determining the recyclability of items and their proper disposal remains a complex task for the general public. In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short. The continued refinement of context-aware models is crucial for enhancing public recycling practices and advancing environmental sustainability.

*Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clean-GS removes background clutter and floaters from 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructions using sparse semantic masks, achieving 60-80% model compression while preserving object quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces high-quality reconstructions but generates hundreds of thousands of spurious Gaussians (floaters) that obscure objects and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications like web and AR/VR.

Method: Multi-stage approach combining: (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal. Uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to target objects.

Result: Reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB on Tanks and Temples dataset while maintaining rendering quality. Achieves 60-80% model compression, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

Conclusion: Clean-GS effectively removes background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks, enabling significant model compression while preserving object quality for practical deployment in constrained environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces high-quality scene reconstructions but generates hundreds of thousands of spurious Gaussians (floaters) scattered throughout the environment. These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes. Experiments on Tanks and Temples show that Clean-GS reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB while maintaining rendering quality, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

### [12] [Four-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Classification from MRI Using Topological Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00918)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDA-Alz achieves 98.19% accuracy for Alzheimer's severity classification using topological data analysis and ensemble learning, outperforming deep learning methods while being more interpretable and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate Alzheimer's disease severity classification from brain MRI is challenging due to limited data, model interpretability concerns, and computational demands of deep learning approaches.

Method: Proposes TDA-Alz framework using topological data analysis to extract structural patterns from brain MRI, followed by feature selection and ensemble learning for four-stage classification (non-demented, moderate, mild, very mild).

Result: Achieves 98.19% accuracy and 99.75% AUC on OASIS-1 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning methods without requiring data augmentation, pretrained networks, or extensive computational resources.

Conclusion: TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning for Alzheimer's severity classification, with strong potential for clinical decision-support systems due to its computational efficiency and feature interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a critical challenge, particularly when limited data and model interpretability are of concern. In this work, we propose TDA-Alz, a novel framework for four-stage Alzheimer's disease severity classification (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild, and very mild) using topological data analysis (TDA) and ensemble learning. Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.
  Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations. These results indicate that TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning models for MRI-based Alzheimer's disease severity classification, with strong potential for real-world clinical decision-support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrast medium in CT pulmonary angiography can cause acute kidney injury in patients with pulmonary embolism and chronic kidney disease, and contrast administration delays treatment for acute cases. Need for safer, faster diagnostic approach.

Method: Used 3D convolutional neural network model to automatically classify pulmonary embolism in CT images without contrast medium.

Result: Model achieved 85% accuracy and 0.84 AUC in pulmonary embolism classification from non-contrast CT images, demonstrating feasibility.

Conclusion: Deep learning approach enables accurate pulmonary embolism diagnosis without contrast medium, potentially reducing kidney injury risks and treatment delays while maintaining diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening disease, early detection and treatment can significantly reduce mortality.

*Luis Yoichi Morales,Francesco Zanlungo,David M. Woollard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Algorithm detects customer browsing behavior (shelf visits) from 3D tracking data in retail stores, validated across different stores, and analyzes browsing-purchase relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous understanding of shopper intent for retail applications, particularly for customer-facing robots and retail planning.

Method: Developed shelf visit algorithm using machine vision-based 3D tracking from overhead cameras, calibrated on human-labeled trajectories from two stores (8138 and 15129 trajectories), with cross-store validation.

Result: Algorithm successfully recognizes customer browsing activity across different store environments, and analysis reveals relationships between browsing patterns and actual purchases.

Conclusion: Shelf browsing information can be valuable for retail planning and human-robot interaction scenarios in retail settings.

Abstract: Motivated by recent challenges in the deployment of robots into customer-facing roles within retail, this work introduces a study of customer activity in physical stores as a step toward autonomous understanding of shopper intent. We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores. Finally, we discuss how shelf browsing information could be used for retail planning and in the domain of human-robot interaction scenarios.

*Feng Luo,Hongbo Pan,Xiang Yang,Baoyu Jiang,Fengqing Liu,Tao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShadowGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for satellite imagery by modeling consistent shadows across multi-temporal images using physics-based rendering and ray marching, achieving better shadow decoupling and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-temporal satellite images have inconsistent shadows due to varying illumination, which degrades 3D reconstruction quality in 3D Gaussian Splatting methods.

Method: Proposes ShadowGS framework that uses physics-based rendering equation from remote sensing with efficient ray marching to model geometrically consistent shadows, plus shadow consistency constraint and shadow map prior for sparse-view inputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in shadow decoupling accuracy, 3D reconstruction precision, and novel view synthesis quality with only minutes of training; works robustly with RGB, pansharpened, and sparse-view satellite inputs.

Conclusion: ShadowGS effectively addresses shadow inconsistencies in multi-temporal satellite imagery, improving 3D reconstruction while maintaining efficient rendering through physics-based modeling and novel constraints.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a novel paradigm for 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery. However, in multi-temporal satellite images, prevalent shadows exhibit significant inconsistencies due to varying illumination conditions. To address this, we propose ShadowGS, a novel framework based on 3DGS. It leverages a physics-based rendering equation from remote sensing, combined with an efficient ray marching technique, to precisely model geometrically consistent shadows while maintaining efficient rendering. Additionally, it effectively disentangles different illumination components and apparent attributes in the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a shadow consistency constraint that significantly enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D reconstruction. We also incorporate a novel shadow map prior to improve performance with sparse-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShadowGS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in shadow decoupling accuracy, 3D reconstruction precision, and novel view synthesis quality, with only a few minutes of training. ShadowGS exhibits robust performance across various settings, including RGB, pansharpened, and sparse-view satellite inputs.

*Jonas Li,Michelle Li,Luke Liu,Heng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LQDS, a large-scale dataset for liquid segmentation, and LQDM, a novel model using cross-attention between boundary and segmentation branches to improve liquid detection in diverse real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liquids are ubiquitous in daily life (water, wine, medicine), but limited attention has been given to liquid segmentation, hindering robots' ability to safely avoid or interact with liquids. The segmentation is challenging due to liquids' diverse appearances, shapes, transparency, reflectivity, and ability to take on arbitrary background appearances.

Method: 1) Constructed LQDS, a large-scale dataset of 5000 real-world images annotated into 14 distinct liquid classes. 2) Designed LQDM, a novel liquid detection model that leverages cross-attention between a dedicated boundary branch and the main segmentation branch to enhance segmentation predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate LQDM's effectiveness on the LQDS test set, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and establishing a strong baseline for semantic segmentation of liquids.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the important but neglected problem of liquid segmentation by introducing both a comprehensive dataset and an effective model, advancing the field and enabling safer robot interactions with liquids in real-world environments.

Abstract: Different types of liquids such as water, wine and medicine appear in all aspects of daily life. However, limited attention has been given to the task, hindering the ability of robots to avoid or interact with liquids safely. The segmentation of liquids is difficult because liquids come in diverse appearances and shapes; moreover, they can be both transparent or reflective, taking on arbitrary objects and scenes from the background or surroundings. To take on this challenge, we construct a large-scale dataset of liquids named LQDS consisting of 5000 real-world images annotated into 14 distinct classes, and design a novel liquid detection model named LQDM, which leverages cross-attention between a dedicated boundary branch and the main segmentation branch to enhance segmentation predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LQDM on the test set of LQDS, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and establishing a strong baseline for the semantic segmentation of liquids.

TL;DR: Researchers introduce a benchmark to evaluate Text-to-Video (T2V) models for generating physics educational videos, finding current models produce visually coherent videos but struggle with conceptual accuracy, especially for abstract topics like electromagnetism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the potential of generative AI models, particularly Text-to-Video systems, for transforming science education by automating the creation of engaging visual explanations for physics concepts.

Method: Created a dedicated benchmark for physics education video generation that decomposes physics concepts into granular teaching points, each accompanied by carefully crafted prompts for visual explanation.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation. The benchmark aims to help the community close this gap and develop T2V systems capable of delivering accurate, curriculum-aligned physics content at scale for personalized learning experiences.

Abstract: Generative AI models, particularly Text-to-Video (T2V) systems, offer a promising avenue for transforming science education by automating the creation of engaging and intuitive visual explanations. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating their potential in physics education by introducing a dedicated benchmark for explanatory video generation. The benchmark is designed to assess how well T2V models can convey core physics concepts through visual illustrations. Each physics concept in our benchmark is decomposed into granular teaching points, with each point accompanied by a carefully crafted prompt intended for visual explanation of the teaching point. T2V models are evaluated on their ability to generate accurate videos in response to these prompts. Our aim is to systematically explore the feasibility of using T2V models to generate high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational content-paving the way toward scalable, accessible, and personalized learning experiences powered by AI. Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict. These findings underscore the gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation. We hope this benchmark helps the community close that gap and move toward T2V systems that can deliver accurate, curriculum-aligned physics content at scale.

TL;DR: DCAM: A deep clustering method using energy-based dynamics via Associative Memories to better integrate representation learning and clustering in a single objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep clustering methods have a disjointed approach where differentiable representation learning is combined with discrete clustering optimization requiring approximations, leading to suboptimal integration between the two components.

Method: Proposes DCAM with a novel loss function using energy-based dynamics via Associative Memories to formulate deep clustering, tying representation learning and clustering more intricately in a single objective.

Result: DCAM shows improved clustering quality across various architecture choices (convolutional, residual, fully-connected) and data modalities (images and text).

Conclusion: The energy-based approach via Associative Memories provides a more integrated solution for deep clustering that works well across different architectures and data types.

Abstract: Deep clustering - joint representation learning and latent space clustering - is a well studied problem especially in computer vision and text processing under the deep learning framework. While the representation learning is generally differentiable, clustering is an inherently discrete optimization task, requiring various approximations and regularizations to fit in a standard differentiable pipeline. This leads to a somewhat disjointed representation learning and clustering. In this work, we propose a novel loss function utilizing energy-based dynamics via Associative Memories to formulate a new deep clustering method, DCAM, which ties together the representation learning and clustering aspects more intricately in a single objective. Our experiments showcase the advantage of DCAM, producing improved clustering quality for various architecture choices (convolutional, residual or fully-connected) and data modalities (images or text).

*Lin Xi,Yingliang Ma,Xiahai Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel FSVOS model using local matching with direction-based sampling and spatio-temporal contrastive learning, tested on new X-ray angiography dataset MOSXAV, outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video segmentation methods rely on inefficient implementations (im2col-like operations) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels that lack portability across non-CUDA devices, limiting their clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes FSVOS model with: 1) Local matching strategy using direction-based sampling perspective for dynamic sampling regions, 2) Non-parametric sampling mechanism for flexibility without retraining, 3) Supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning for feature coherence across frames.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods on CADICA, XACV, and newly introduced MOSXAV datasets in segmentation accuracy and generalization (seen/unseen categories).

Conclusion: The approach offers enhanced flexibility and potential for wide clinical applications through portable, efficient sampling and improved feature consistency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel FSVOS model that employs a local matching strategy to restrict the search space to the most relevant neighboring pixels. Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real 3D human pose data is expensive and studio-bound, while in-the-wild datasets lack ground truth. Need for diverse, accurately labeled synthetic data to overcome these limitations.

Method: Unreal Engine 5 pipeline using Movie Render Queue for offline rendering. Generates frames with 3D joints (world/camera coordinates), 2D COCO-style keypoints with occlusion flags, bounding boxes, and camera intrinsics/extrinsics.

Result: Created UnrealPose-1M dataset with ~1M frames: 5 scripted coherent sequences (5 scenes, 40 actions, 5 subjects) and 3 randomized sequences (3 scenes, 100 actions, 5 subjects) with diverse camera trajectories.

Conclusion: Released both UnrealPose-1M dataset and UnrealPose-Gen pipeline to support third-party generation of human pose data, with real-to-synthetic validation showing promising results on multiple computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Diverse, accurately labeled 3D human pose data is expensive and studio-bound, while in-the-wild datasets lack known ground truth. We introduce UnrealPose-Gen, an Unreal Engine 5 pipeline built on Movie Render Queue for high-quality offline rendering. Our generated frames include: (i) 3D joints in world and camera coordinates, (ii) 2D projections and COCO-style keypoints with occlusion and joint-visibility flags, (iii) person bounding boxes, and (iv) camera intrinsics and extrinsics. We use UnrealPose-Gen to present UnrealPose-1M, an approximately one million frame corpus comprising eight sequences: five scripted "coherent" sequences spanning five scenes, approximately 40 actions, and five subjects; and three randomized sequences across three scenes, approximately 100 actions, and five subjects, all captured from diverse camera trajectories for broad viewpoint coverage. As a fidelity check, we report real-to-synthetic results on four tasks: image-to-3D pose, 2D keypoint detection, 2D-to-3D lifting, and person detection/segmentation. Though time and resources constrain us from an unlimited dataset, we release the UnrealPose-1M dataset, as well as the UnrealPose-Gen pipeline to support third-party generation of human pose data.

*Julian D. Santamaria,Claudia Isaza,Jhony H. Giraldo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildIng improves wildlife image classification across geographical domains by integrating text descriptions with image features to create invariant representations, boosting generalization when tested on new regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife monitoring models using camera trap images struggle with geographical domain shifts, suffering significant performance drops when applied to new regions due to reliance on image-based representations sensitive to background, lighting, and environmental variations.

Method: WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features to create invariant representations that capture consistent semantic information about species appearance, making the model more robust to geographical domain shifts.

Result: WildIng enhances accuracy of foundation models like BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions, evaluated on datasets from America and Africa, addressing the performance drop from 84.77% to 16.17% seen in previous approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating textual descriptions with image features creates more robust wildlife representations that generalize better across geographical locations, offering a promising solution to the domain shift problem in automated wildlife monitoring.

Abstract: Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Julian075/CATALOG/tree/WildIng.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing visual grounding datasets rely too heavily on explicit referring expressions (position, size, color), limiting performance on implicit tasks that require domain-specific knowledge about drone application scenarios.

Method: Created DVGBench dataset with both explicit and implicit queries across six drone scenarios; developed DroneVG-R1 model integrating Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within reinforcement learning to convert implicit references to explicit ones.

Result: Evaluation shows mainstream models have substantial limitations in reasoning capabilities for implicit visual grounding tasks, highlighting the need for improved reasoning in LVLMs for drone-based agents.

Conclusion: DVGBench provides a valuable benchmark for advancing reasoning capacity in large vision-language models for drone applications, with the proposed I2E-CoT approach offering a promising direction for handling implicit visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown strong promise across visual grounding (VG) tasks. However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty. Finally, an evaluation of mainstream models on both explicit and implicit VG tasks reveals substantial limitations in their reasoning capabilities. These findings provide actionable insights for advancing the reasoning capacity of LVLMs for drone-based agents. The code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/zytx121/DVGBench

TL;DR: Frequency-domain early fusion RGB-Event tracking framework that uses FFT to selectively fuse high-frequency event information into RGB, with motion-guided spatial sparsification to reduce computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event tracking methods fail to fully exploit event cameras' high dynamic range and motion sensitivity, while processing low-information regions uniformly leads to unnecessary computational overhead.

Method: Transform RGB and event modalities to frequency domain via FFT, decouple amplitude/phase components, selectively fuse high-frequency event information through amplitude and phase attention, use motion-guided spatial sparsification to filter low-information regions, feed sparse target-relevant features to backbone network.

Result: Extensive experiments on FE108, FELT, and COESOT benchmark datasets demonstrate high performance and efficiency of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-domain early fusion framework effectively aggregates high-frequency event information while reducing backbone computation through motion-guided spatial sparsification, achieving superior tracking performance.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ITSELF is an attention-guided framework for text-based person search that uses the model's own attention to create local alignments without extra supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for text-based person search suffer from shortcut learning, spurious correlations, and misalignment issues. Injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. The authors found that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence early in training, motivating an attention-guided approach.

Method: ITSELF uses Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) to convert model attention into high-saliency tokens for local objectives. Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS) aggregates attention across layers with diversity-aware selection. Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS) schedules retention budget from coarse to fine during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming effectiveness and robustness without additional prior supervision.

Conclusion: The attention-guided framework ITSELF effectively learns fine-grained correspondences between images and text for person search without extra supervision, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced and show strong promise for text-based person search (TBPS), a task that requires capturing fine-grained relationships between images and text to distinguish individuals. Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

On the C-NMC 2019 dataset (12,528 original images from 62 patients), the system achieves a 97.89% F1-score and 97.89% accuracy on the test set, with statistical validation through 100-iteration Monte Carlo experiments confirming significant improvements (p < 0.001) over baseline methods. The proposed pipeline outperforms existing approaches by up to 4.67% while using 89% fewer parameters than VGG16 (15.2M vs. 138M). The attention mechanism provides interpretable visualizations of diagnostically relevant cellular features, demonstrating that modern attention-based architectures can improve leukemic cell classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.

*Kiet Dang Vu,Trung Thai Tran,Kien Nguyen Do Trung,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mono3DV introduces 3D-aware bipartite matching and variational query denoising for monocular 3D object detection, achieving SOTA on KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-like architectures for monocular 3D object detection exclude 3D attributes from bipartite matching due to instability from ill-posed 3D estimation, causing high-quality 3D predictions to be suppressed by 2D-only criteria.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching incorporating 3D geometric information into matching cost, 2) 3D-DeNoising scheme to stabilize training, 3) Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome gradient vanishing issues of conventional denoising techniques.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark without using any external data.

Conclusion: Mono3DV successfully addresses the limitations of existing DETR-like monocular 3D detectors by integrating 3D geometric information into the matching process and stabilizing training with novel denoising techniques.

Abstract: While DETR-like architectures have demonstrated significant potential for monocular 3D object detection, they are often hindered by a critical limitation: the exclusion of 3D attributes from the bipartite matching process. This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance. Without leveraging any external data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.

### [29] [Deepfake Detection with Multi-Artifact Subspace Fine-Tuning and Selective Layer Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01041)
*Xiang Zhang,Wenliang Weng,Daoyong Fu,Ziqiang Li,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MASM improves deepfake detection generalization by decoupling semantic and artifact representations using multi-artifact subspaces with selective layer masks and regularization constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection struggles with cross-dataset and real-world scenarios due to diverse artifact distributions from different forgery methods. Pretrained models lose semantic stability when adapting to new artifacts, and existing methods fail to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic structures.

Method: Proposes MASM: 1) Uses singular value decomposition to partition pretrained weights into stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces; 2) Introduces selective layer masks to adaptively regulate layer updates based on artifact subspace learning state; 3) Applies orthogonality and spectral consistency constraints to regularize artifact subspaces for complementary representations.

Result: The method enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving general semantic subspace, suppresses overfitting to single forgery characteristics, and learns complementary artifact representations with stable spectral structure.

Conclusion: MASM addresses deepfake detection generalization challenges by explicitly separating semantic and artifact representations, providing a robust framework for cross-dataset scenarios through subspace decomposition and adaptive regularization.

Abstract: Deepfake detection still faces significant challenges in cross-dataset and real-world complex scenarios. The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable low-latency immersive telepresence by addressing the sparsity of real-time LiDAR point clouds and the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance

Method: Combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture

Result: Produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than recent training-based depth completion approaches, with accurate geometry and no multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the need for high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification for immersive telepresence applications, achieving real-time performance with high-quality dense 3D reconstruction

Abstract: To realize low-latency spatial transmission system for immersive telepresence, there are two major problems: capturing dynamic 3D scene densely and processing them in real time. LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.

### [31] [Evaluating transfer learning strategies for improving dairy cattle body weight prediction in small farms using depth-image and point-cloud data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01044)
*Jin Wang,Angelo De Castro,Yuxi Zhang,Lucas Basolli Borsatto,Yuechen Guo,Victoria Bastos Primo,Ana Beatriz Montevecchio Bernardino,Gota Morota,Ricardo C Chebel,Haipeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transfer learning from large farms significantly improves body weight prediction on small dairy farms with limited data, outperforming single-source learning and matching joint learning performance, with no clear advantage between depth-image and point-cloud models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision offers automated monitoring for dairy cattle, but transfer learning effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies are poorly understood in livestock applications. There's also limited direct comparison between depth-image and point-cloud modalities for body weight prediction in dairy cattle.

Method: Collected top-view depth images and point-cloud data from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small farms. Evaluated four deep learning models: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Compared transfer learning from large farm to small farm against single-source and joint learning approaches.

Result: Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is well-suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data. Pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and cattle populations.

Abstract: Computer vision provides automated, non-invasive, and scalable tools for monitoring dairy cattle, thereby supporting management, health assessment, and phenotypic data collection. Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingGen is the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods with diverse datasets and new metrics for visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of driving world models lacks rigorous benchmarks despite growing research. Existing evaluations have critical limitations: generic video metrics overlook safety factors, trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified, temporal/agent consistency is neglected, controllability is ignored, and current datasets lack diversity needed for real-world deployment.

Method: Created DrivingGen benchmark combining: 1) Diverse evaluation dataset curated from driving datasets and internet-scale video sources covering varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers; 2) New metric suite assessing visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability.

Result: Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models revealed clear trade-offs: general video generation models produce better visuals but break physics, while driving-specific models capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality.

Conclusion: DrivingGen provides a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Video generation models, as one form of world models, have emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers in AI, promising agents the ability to imagine the future by modeling the temporal evolution of complex scenes. In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality. DrivingGen offers a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making.

TL;DR: EgoGrasp: First method to reconstruct world-space hand-object interactions from egocentric monocular videos with dynamic cameras in the wild.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate world-space hand-object interaction reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and VR. Existing methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories.

Method: Multi-stage framework with: 1) robust pre-process pipeline using spatial intelligence models, 2) whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models (template-free and scalable to multiple objects), and 3) multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in world-space hand-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: EgoGrasp successfully addresses challenges of severe camera motion and frequent occlusions in egocentric in-the-wild videos, providing the first effective solution for reconstructing world-space hand-object interactions from dynamic monocular egocentric footage.

Abstract: We propose EgoGrasp, the first method to reconstruct world-space hand-object interactions (W-HOI) from egocentric monocular videos with dynamic cameras in the wild. Accurate W-HOI reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and virtual reality. However, existing hand-object interactions (HOI) methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories. Some recent approaches attempt world-space hand estimation but overlook object poses and HOI constraints. Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm. Our HOI prior model is template-free and scalable to multiple objects. In experiments, we prove our method achieving state-of-the-art performance in W-HOI reconstruction.

Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%. The proposed CDO module is characterized by ease of integration into existing systems without structural modifications and utilizes existing model parameters to facilitate ongoing training, thus offering substantial benefits in performance, power efficiency, and operational flexibility in embedded systems.

Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging is valuable but faces challenges in efficient reconstruction from compressive sensing measurements. Need to leverage unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images for better reconstruction.

Method: Divide-and-conquer strategy with LSST architecture featuring Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for spectral modeling using Grouped Spectral Self-attention and Spectrum Shuffle, and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing using depth-wise separable convolutions. Also introduces Focal Spectrum Loss for dynamic training weighting.

Conclusion: The proposed LSST architecture effectively addresses hyperspectral image reconstruction challenges by separately processing spectral and spatial information with lightweight components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is essential across various disciplines for its capacity to capture rich spectral information. However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: Need for watermarking methods for vision generative models that are training-free, certified, general across different model paradigms, and maintain image quality.

Method: Uses patch-level luminance statistics with predefined binary patterns and thresholds; leverages guidance technique as plug-and-play watermark guidance for seamless injection across different generative models.

Result: Evaluated on 9 models across diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks; demonstrates high detection accuracy, strong robustness against image transformations, and good visual quality.

Conclusion: Luminark provides a general, training-free, probabilistically-certified watermarking solution for vision generative models with strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{Luminark}, a training-free and probabilistically-certified watermarking method for general vision generative models. Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks. Across all evaluations, Luminark consistently demonstrates high detection accuracy, strong robustness against common image transformations, and good performance on visual quality.

### [41] [NarrativeTrack: Evaluating Video Language Models Beyond the Frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01095)
*Hyeonjeong Ha,Jinjin Ge,Bo Feng,Kaixin Ma,Gargi Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NarrativeTrack is the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to understand video narratives through fine-grained entity tracking across time, revealing a trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have impressive vision-language reasoning but lack understanding of temporally unfolding narratives in videos. True narrative understanding requires grounding entities (who, what, when, where) across dynamic visual and temporal contexts, which remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces NarrativeTrack benchmark with Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP) framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. Uses automated entity-centric pipeline for scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs show strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context but hallucinate entity contexts.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning in MLLMs, indicating narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language reasoning, yet their ability to understand temporally unfolding narratives in videos remains underexplored. True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides the first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension in MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture against widely used pretrained and transfer learning CNN models across five real-world image datasets. The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks.

Conclusion: HAQAGen is a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios, achieving resolution-invariant colorization with balanced chromatic realism and structural fidelity.

Abstract: We present HAQAGen, a unified generative model for resolution-invariant NIR-to-RGB colorization that balances chromatic realism with structural fidelity. The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics. These results position HAQAGen as a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios. Project Page: https://rajeev-dw9.github.io/HAQAGen/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAIN introduces Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) to efficiently generate high-resolution semantic features for real-time segmentation, outperforming bilinear interpolation with better feature alignment and context while maintaining low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpolation methods like bilinear interpolation produce coarse high-resolution features with feature misalignment and insufficient context, while enriching semantics typically requires heavy computation that conflicts with low-latency inference requirements.

Method: Proposes Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) that determines both spatial and semantic relations between pixels from features of different resolutions, then uses these relations to adaptively interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics.

Result: GAIN achieves 78.8 mIoU with 22.3 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.6 mIoU with 64.5 FPS on CamVid using NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, setting new state-of-the-art results for low-latency semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: GAI provides an effective solution for generating fine-grained high-resolution features with rich semantics while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling real-time semantic segmentation with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and it requires high-resolution feature maps for dense prediction. Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation. In experiments, the GAI-based semantic segmentation networks, i.e., GAIN, can achieve78.8 mIoU with 22.3 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.6 mIoU with 64.5 on CamVid using an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, which are the new state-of-the-art results of low-latency semantic segmentation.

*Andrés Bell-Navas,Jesús Garicano-Mena,Antonella Ausiello,Soledad Le Clainche,María Villalba-Orero,Enrique Lara-Pezzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioMOD-Net is an AI framework that uses echocardiography videos to diagnose HFpEF subtypes and predict disease onset time in preclinical mouse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HFpEF is difficult to diagnose early due to diverse comorbidities and prolonged subclinical stages. Current AI models only do binary detection and lack comorbidity-specific phenotyping and temporal progression prediction.

Method: Used mouse echocardiography videos from control, hyperglycemic, obesity, and hypertension groups. Applied Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition to extract temporal features, then used Vision Transformers for classification (diagnosis) and regression (predicting HFpEF onset age).

Result: 65% overall diagnostic accuracy across four groups, with all classes >50% accuracy. Prognostic module achieved 21.72 weeks RMSE for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with obesity and hypertension showing most accurate estimates.

Conclusion: The unified framework demonstrates multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction from single cine loops, even with small data, providing foundation for integrated diagnostic-prognostic modeling in preclinical HFpEF research.

Abstract: Introduction: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) arises from diverse comorbidities and progresses through prolonged subclinical stages, making early diagnosis and prognosis difficult. Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.
  Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.
  Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.
  Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, large-scale camouflage datasets with dense annotations are scarce due to expensive collection and labeling costs, limiting progress in camouflage dense prediction tasks.

Method: Developed GenCAMO-DB dataset with multi-modal annotations and GenCAMO framework - an environment-aware, mask-free generative system that synthesizes realistic camouflage images with dense annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show GenCAMO significantly improves dense prediction performance on complex camouflage scenes by providing high-quality synthetic training data across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: Generative models can effectively address data scarcity in camouflage analysis by synthesizing realistic training data, enabling better performance in camouflage object detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Conceal dense prediction (CDP), especially RGB-D camouflage object detection and open-vocabulary camouflage object segmentation, plays a crucial role in advancing the understanding and reasoning of complex camouflage scenes. However, high-quality and large-scale camouflage datasets with dense annotation remain scarce due to expensive data collection and labeling costs. To address this challenge, we explore leveraging generative models to synthesize realistic camouflage image-dense data for training CDP models with fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, and auxiliary reasoning. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce GenCAMO-DB, a large-scale camouflage dataset with multi-modal annotations, including depth maps, scene graphs, attribute descriptions, and text prompts; (ii) we present GenCAMO, an environment-aware and mask-free generative framework that produces high-fidelity camouflage image-dense annotations; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that GenCAMO significantly improves dense prediction performance on complex camouflage scenes by providing high-quality synthetic data. The code and datasets will be released after paper acceptance.

### [47] [Crowded Video Individual Counting Informed by Social Grouping and Spatial-Temporal Displacement Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01192)
*Hao Lu,Xuhui Zhu,Wenjing Zhang,Yanan Li,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMAN++ is a new Video Individual Counting method that improves performance in crowded scenes by using one-to-many matching and spatial-temporal displacement priors, validated on a new WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Individual Counting (VIC) approaches underperform in congested scenes like metro commuting, where identifying co-existent pedestrians across frames is challenging due to dense crowds, occlusions, and dynamic flows.

Method: Proposes OMAN++ with two key innovations: 1) Relaxes one-to-one matching to one-to-many matching using social grouping prior, implemented via implicit context generator and O2M matcher; 2) Uses spatial-temporal displacement prior via displacement prior injector to strengthen matching, feature extraction, and training.

Result: OMAN++ outperforms state-of-the-art VIC methods on standard benchmarks (SenseCrowd, CroHD, MovingDroneCrowd) and shows 38.12% error reduction on the new WuhanMetroCrowd dataset, demonstrating clear advantage in crowded scenes.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel VIC baseline that effectively addresses crowded scene challenges through social grouping and displacement priors, with significant performance improvements validated on multiple datasets including a new challenging metro crowd dataset.

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task aiming to estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-ISSM uses RBF-based implicit functions for continuous local feature representation to avoid matching errors in irregular point clouds, combined with a ResGrouped-MLP network for multi-scale quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds makes objective quality assessment challenging, especially in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence due to matching errors in irregular data.

Method: Proposes MS-ISSM using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into implicit function coefficient comparison. Also introduces ResGrouped-MLP network with grouped encoding strategy, Residual Blocks, and Channel-wise Attention for hierarchical multi-scale feature processing.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-ISSM effectively addresses point cloud quality assessment challenges by avoiding matching errors through implicit function representation and hierarchical multi-scale feature processing, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds poses a significant challenge for objective quality assessment (PCQA), particularly in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence. To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

TL;DR: RefSR-Adv: adversarial attack on Reference-based Super-Resolution that degrades outputs by perturbing only the reference image, exploiting model's over-reliance on reference features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, but the vulnerability to adversarial attacks has not been fully explored. The paper aims to fill this research gap and reveal security vulnerabilities in RefSR systems.

Method: Propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that maximizes the difference between adversarial and clean outputs by perturbing only the reference image. The attack is tested across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets.

Result: RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across all tested architectures. Experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of low-resolution input and reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing the model's over-reliance on reference features as a key security flaw.

Conclusion: This study reveals a security vulnerability in RefSR systems where adversarial perturbations to reference images can severely degrade super-resolution outputs. The findings aim to urge researchers to pay attention to the robustness of RefSR models against such attacks.

Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to recover high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw. This study reveals a security vulnerability in RefSR systems, aiming to urge researchers to pay attention to the robustness of RefSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StreamVGGT's frame-wise causal attention causes unbounded KV cache growth, leading to escalating memory consumption and inference latency as more frames are processed, limiting practical streaming applications.

Method: Joint pruning and quantization of KV cache: redundant KVs from multi-view inputs are pruned via token importance identification, and KV quantization leverages unique tensor distributions for further compression.

Result: Achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while reducing memory usage by 4.42× and accelerating inference by 5.48×, enabling scalable streaming 3D applications.

Conclusion: XStreamVGGT provides a tuning-free approach for efficient streaming inference through systematic KV cache compression, making large-scale transformer-based 3D geometry models practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have benefited substantially from large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention for strong streaming reconstruction, but suffers from unbounded KV cache growth, leading to escalating memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. We propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that systematically compresses the KV cache through joint pruning and quantization, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs originating from multi-view inputs are pruned through efficient token importance identification, enabling a fixed memory budget. Leveraging the unique distribution of KV tensors, we incorporate KV quantization to further reduce memory consumption. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling scalable and practical streaming 3D applications.

*Riccardo Gelato,Carlo Sgaravatti,Jakob Grahn,Giacomo Boracchi,Filippo Maria Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapting Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Sentinel-1 SAR data for faster avalanche segmentation annotation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping is time-consuming and requires domain experts, creating a need for automated solutions to accelerate this process

Method: Adapt SAM foundation model to SAR data using: (1) adapters to bridge domain gap, (2) multiple encoders for multi-channel SAR inputs, (3) prompt-engineering for better avalanche localization, and (4) efficient training algorithm to limit encoder training time

Result: Developed an integrated annotation tool that speeds up SAR image annotation for avalanche mapping

Conclusion: The adapted SAM model successfully addresses domain-specific challenges of SAR avalanche segmentation and provides a practical solution to accelerate expert annotation workflows

Abstract: Remote sensing solutions for avalanche segmentation and mapping are key to supporting risk forecasting and mitigation in mountain regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.

TL;DR: UniSH is a unified feed-forward framework for joint metric-scale 3D scene and human reconstruction that addresses sim-to-real domain gaps through innovative training with unlabeled real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge is the scarcity of large-scale annotated real-world data, forcing reliance on synthetic datasets which creates a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos.

Method: Proposes a training paradigm leveraging unlabeled in-the-wild data with two core components: (1) robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details from an expert depth model, and (2) two-stage supervision scheme learning coarse localization on synthetic data then fine-tuning on real data by optimizing geometric correspondence between SMPL mesh and human point cloud.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

Conclusion: UniSH enables joint recovery of high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent metric-scale SMPL bodies in a single forward pass, effectively bridging scene reconstruction and human mesh recovery priors.

Abstract: We present UniSH, a unified, feed-forward framework for joint metric-scale 3D scene and human reconstruction. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

TL;DR: CODA improves object-centric learning by adding register slots to reduce interference and using contrastive alignment to strengthen slot-image correspondence, achieving better object discovery and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slot Attention with diffusion models suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content, limiting object-centric learning performance.

Method: Proposes CODA with two key components: (1) register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (2) contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence, serving as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information.

Result: Improves object discovery (+6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation on both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO) over strong baselines, with negligible overhead from register slots.

Conclusion: CODA shows potential as an effective framework for robust object-centric learning in complex, real-world scenes, offering efficient and scalable improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image reconstruction problems are challenging due to ill-posedness and lack of supervised datasets. Traditional DEQ models require supervised pairs (x,y), but in practice only measurements y are available.

Method: HyDRA combines measurement consistency with an adaptive denoising regularization term and uses a data-driven early stopping criterion for training DEQ models without ground truth data.

Result: Experiments on sparse-view CT demonstrate competitive reconstruction quality and fast inference compared to supervised methods.

Conclusion: HyDRA provides an effective measurement-only framework for training DEQ models that achieves good performance without requiring supervised training pairs.

Abstract: Solving image reconstruction problems of the form \(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}\) remains challenging due to ill-posedness and the lack of large-scale supervised datasets. Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models have been used successfully but typically require supervised pairs \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\). In many practical settings, only measurements \(\mathbf{y}\) are available. We introduce HyDRA (Hybrid Denoising Regularization Adaptation), a measurement-only framework for DEQ training that combines measurement consistency with an adaptive denoising regularization term, together with a data-driven early stopping criterion.

*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Yuting Wang,Haowen Xiao,Jiarui Zhu,Yingying Zhu,Yongtao Liu,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RFAssigner is a novel label assignment strategy for dense object detectors that addresses scale imbalance by adaptively selecting supplementary positive samples for small objects using Gaussian Receptive Field similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current label assignment methods for dense object detectors often assign insufficient positive samples to small objects, creating scale imbalance during training that hinders multi-scale learning capabilities.

Method: RFAssigner first establishes initial positive samples using point-based prior, then uses Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure similarity between unassigned candidate locations and ground-truth objects, adaptively selecting supplementary positive samples from unassigned pool.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three datasets show RFAssigner achieves state-of-the-art performance across all object scales with FCOS-ResNet-50, consistently outperforming existing strategies without requiring auxiliary modules or heuristics.

Conclusion: RFAssigner effectively addresses scale imbalance in dense object detection through adaptive label assignment, enhancing multi-scale learning capabilities and achieving superior performance across diverse object scale distributions.

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in training dense object detectors. State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. Notably, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with RFAssigner achieves state-of-the-art performance across all object scales, consistently outperforming existing strategies without requiring auxiliary modules or heuristics.

*Hamad Khan,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MambaFormer, an LLM-based hybrid MoE framework combining Transformer and State Space Model experts for efficient medical QA with intelligent token-level routing and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational cost vs. efficiency trade-off in deploying LLMs for clinical applications, enabling resource-constrained clinical deployment.

Method: Hybrid MoE framework with lightweight gating mechanism for token-level dynamic routing between Transformer expert (ET5) for short complex queries and State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long high-throughput sequences, fine-tuned on custom DentalQA dataset with utility-guided multi-objective loss optimization.

Result: Outperforms SOTA with BERTScore 0.9180 and ultra-low latency (0.077s), achieving 24.4x speedup over T5-Large on DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets.

Conclusion: MambaFormer establishes a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment by achieving Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world clinical applications is constrained by the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and the efficiency of linear-time models. To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.

### [58] [S2M-Net: Spectral-Spatial Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation with Morphology-Aware Adaptive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01285)
*Md. Sanaullah Chowdhury Lameya Sabrin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2M-Net: A lightweight 4.7M-parameter medical image segmentation network using spectral token mixing and adaptive loss to solve the trilemma of local precision, global context, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures fail to balance three critical requirements for medical image segmentation: local precision for boundary accuracy, global context for anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency for deployment on limited clinical data and hardware. Convolutional networks offer local precision but limited receptive fields, while transformers provide global context at prohibitive O(n²) computational cost that causes overfitting on small datasets.

Method: S2M-Net introduces two key innovations: (1) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM) that exploits spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, achieving O(HW log HW) global context without quadratic attention cost; (2) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL) that automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across 16 medical imaging datasets spanning 8 modalities shows state-of-the-art performance: 96.12% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77% on surgical instruments (+17.85% over prior art), and 80.90% on brain tumors. The method achieves consistent 3-18% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5-6× fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.

Conclusion: S2M-Net successfully resolves the medical image segmentation trilemma by providing an efficient architecture that balances local precision, global context, and computational efficiency through spectral token mixing and adaptive loss mechanisms, enabling high-performance segmentation on diverse medical imaging tasks with limited data and hardware constraints.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires balancing local precision for boundary-critical clinical applications, global context for anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency for deployment on limited data and hardware a trilemma that existing architectures fail to resolve. Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VReID-XFD is a video-based benchmark for extreme far-distance aerial-to-ground person re-identification, featuring 371 identities across 11.75M frames captured from 5.8-120m altitudes, showing severe performance degradation with distance and nadir views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing person re-identification systems fail in extreme far-distance aerial-to-ground scenarios due to severe resolution degradation, extreme viewpoint changes, unstable motion cues, and clothing variation that undermine appearance-based assumptions.

Method: Created VReID-XFD benchmark derived from DetReIDX dataset with 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75M frames captured across altitudes (5.8-120m), viewing angles (30-90°), and distances up to 120m. Supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation with strict identity-disjoint splits.

Result: Systematic analysis shows monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, universal disadvantage of nadir views, and trade-off between peak performance and robustness. Best-performing SAS-PReID method achieves only 43.93% mAP in aerial-to-ground setting. Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions.

Conclusion: VReID-XFD establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme far-distance person re-identification, revealing significant limitations of current methods and providing a public dataset, annotations, and evaluation protocols to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) across aerial and ground views at extreme far distances introduces a distinct operating regime where severe resolution degradation, extreme viewpoint changes, unstable motion cues, and clothing variation jointly undermine the appearance-based assumptions of existing ReID systems. To study this regime, we introduce VReID-XFD, a video-based benchmark and community challenge for extreme far-distance (XFD) aerial-to-ground person re-identification. VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness. Even the best-performing SAS-PReID method achieves only 43.93 percent mAP in the aerial-to-ground setting.

### [60] [LinMU: Multimodal Understanding Made Linear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01322)
*Hongjie Wang,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinMU is a linear-complexity Vision-Language Model that replaces quadratic self-attention with a dual-branch M-MATE block (Flex-MA + Local-Swin) and uses three-stage distillation to match teacher performance while achieving 2.7× faster TTFT and 9.0× higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from quadratic complexity of self-attention, making them expensive for high-resolution images and long videos, and preventing deployment on edge devices.

Method: Replace self-attention with M-MATE blocks (Flex-MA bidirectional state-space model for global context + Local-Swin window attention for local correlations). Use three-stage distillation: 1) initialize branches with self-attention weights, train Flex-MA alone; 2) unfreeze Local-Swin, joint fine-tuning; 3) unfreeze remaining blocks with LoRA adapters, regress on teacher's hidden states and logits.

Result: Matches teacher performance on MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME benchmarks. Reduces TTFT by up to 2.7×, improves token throughput by up to 9.0× on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm importance of each distillation stage and both M-MATE branches.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, enabling long-context VLMs for high-resolution images and long videos while being efficient enough for edge deployment.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.

*Weihang You,Hanqi Jiang,Yi Pan,Junhao Chen,Tianming Liu,Fei Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroAlign is a novel fMRI-video alignment framework that mimics the hierarchical visual system, using neural-temporal contrastive learning and enhanced vector quantization to achieve superior cross-modal retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding neural responses to visual stimuli are limited because they reduce neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, failing to capture the hierarchical and temporal nature of visual processing in the brain. There's a modality gap between neural data and visual inputs that needs to be bridged.

Method: NeuroAlign implements a two-stage framework inspired by biological visual pathways: 1) Global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) that models temporal dynamics via bidirectional prediction between modalities, and 2) Fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. The DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting.

Result: Experiments show that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, demonstrating superior performance in aligning fMRI data with video stimuli.

Conclusion: NeuroAlign establishes a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms by successfully bridging the modality gap and capturing the hierarchical, temporal nature of visual processing in the brain.

Abstract: Understanding neural responses to visual stimuli remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of brain representations and the modality gap between neural data and visual inputs. Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.

### [62] [Slot-ID: Identity-Preserving Video Generation from Reference Videos via Slot-Based Temporal Identity Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01352)
*Yixuan Lai,He Wang,Kun Zhou,Tianjia Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video generation method that uses short reference videos instead of single images to better preserve subject identity and natural facial dynamics while maintaining prompt faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle to preserve user-specified identity in generated videos, especially when using single reference images which ignore temporal information, leading to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and generic "average" faces during viewpoint and expression changes.

Method: Introduces an identity-conditioned diffusion-transformer video generator that uses short reference videos rather than single portraits. A Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens from reference clips that capture subject-specific facial dynamics while remaining compatible with pretrained backbones.

Result: The approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts, despite adding only lightweight conditioning.

Conclusion: Using short reference videos instead of single images enables better preservation of subject identity and natural facial dynamics in generated videos, addressing key limitations of current identity-preserving video generation methods.

Abstract: Producing prompt-faithful videos that preserve a user-specified identity remains challenging: models need to extrapolate facial dynamics from sparse reference while balancing the tension between identity preservation and motion naturalness. Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and "average" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.

*Dang H. Pham,Tu N. Nguyen,Hoa N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This dissertation proposes three advanced person re-identification methods: SCM-ReID for supervised learning, IQAGA/DAPRH for unsupervised domain adaptation, and ViTC-UReID for fully unsupervised settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person re-identification faces challenges including appearance variations, domain shifts between different camera systems, and limited labeled data availability, which hinder deployment in real-world surveillance systems.

Method: Three approaches: 1) SCM-ReID combines supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization; 2) IQAGA and DAPRH use GAN-based augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement for UDA; 3) ViTC-UReID employs Vision Transformer encoding with camera-aware proxy learning for unsupervised ReID.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 with SCM-ReID; up to 12% mAP/Rank-1 improvements in UDA scenarios; and outperformed existing unsupervised methods on large-scale benchmarks including DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance ReID research by addressing key limitations in feature learning, domain adaptation, and label noise handling, enabling more robust deployment in real-world surveillance systems.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in intelligent surveillance systems by linking identities across multiple cameras in complex environments. However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The contributions advance ReID research by addressing key limitations in feature learning, domain adaptation, and label noise handling, paving the way for robust deployment in real-world surveillance systems.

*Jiawei Fang,Ruonan Zheng,Xiaoxia Gao,Shifan Jiang,Anjun Chen,Qi Ye,Shihui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GID is a lightweight Transformer that denoises IMU data from loose-fitting garments, enabling accurate wearable motion capture without tight sensor attachment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable inertial MoCap requires tight sensor attachment which is intrusive and uncomfortable for daily use. Loose-fitting garments cause sensor-body displacement that corrupts standard inertial pipelines.

Method: GID uses a location-aware expert architecture with shared spatio-temporal backbone for global motion modeling and per-IMU expert heads for local garment dynamics, plus lightweight fusion module for cross-part consistency. It factorizes loose-wear MoCap into location-specific denoising, adaptive cross-wear fusion, and general pose prediction.

Result: GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types. It consistently improves state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods as a drop-in module.

Conclusion: GID provides an effective solution for comfortable, accurate wearable motion capture by addressing the structured corruption from loose-fitting garments through specialized denoising architecture.

Abstract: Wearable inertial motion capture (MoCap) provides a portable, occlusion-free, and privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based systems, but its accuracy depends on tightly attached sensors - an intrusive and uncomfortable requirement for daily use. Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency. This inductive bias enables stable training and effective learning from limited paired loose-tight IMU data. We also introduce GarMoCap, a combined public and newly collected dataset covering diverse users, motions, and garments. Experiments show that GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types, consistently improving state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods when used as a drop-in module.

TL;DR: A disentangled deep learning framework for cryo-ET that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content, enabling better discovery of macromolecular morphologies without extensive manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expectation-maximization methods for cryo-ET morphology analysis miss rare but important morphologies and require extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, limiting their effectiveness in discovering novel macromolecular structures.

Method: A disentangled deep representation learning framework with a novel multi-choice learning module that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in representation space, using the learned morphological content to generate template morphologies.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real cryo-ET datasets show clear improvements over prior methods, including the discovery of previously unidentified macromolecular morphologies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling better disentanglement of transformations from morphological content, leading to improved discovery of macromolecular structures in cryo-ET data.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides direct 3D visualization of macromolecules inside the cell, enabling analysis of their in situ morphology. This morphology can be regarded as an SE(3)-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies. Experiments on simulated and real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate clear improvements over prior methods, including the discovery of previously unidentified macromolecular morphologies.

TL;DR: First benchmark ParkRecon3D for parking scene reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting framework ParkGaussian that improves reconstruction quality and downstream parking slot detection alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, but 3D reconstruction remains underexplored despite being crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Simply improving visual quality doesn't directly benefit autonomous parking since the key entry point is slots perception.

Method: Created ParkRecon3D benchmark with sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. Proposed ParkGaussian framework integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting for parking scene reconstruction. Introduced slot-aware reconstruction strategy leveraging existing parking perception methods to enhance synthesis quality of slot regions.

Result: ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ParkRecon3D benchmark and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ParkRecon3D benchmark and ParkGaussian framework effectively address the gap in 3D parking scene reconstruction, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality and better alignment with downstream parking slot detection tasks.

Abstract: Parking is a critical task for autonomous driving systems (ADS), with unique challenges in crowded parking slots and GPS-denied environments. However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face super-resolution is challenging due to loss of fine structural details and identity-specific features, especially at extreme upscaling factors where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure.

Method: Integrates dense Gaussian heatmaps of facial landmarks into input representation to focus on semantically important regions, uses compact Swin Transformer backbone to capture long-range context while preserving local geometry.

Result: Superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention on CelebA benchmark; works well even at 8x magnification; balances reconstruction accuracy with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SwinIFS provides effective identity-preserving face super-resolution suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

Abstract: Face super-resolution aims to recover high-quality facial images from severely degraded low-resolution inputs, but remains challenging due to the loss of fine structural details and identity-specific features. This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

*Gong Gao,Zekai Wang,Jian Zhao,Ziqi Xie,Xianhui Liu,Weidong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGMTN uses adaptive mask learning and group-global feature fusion to improve face attribute recognition by focusing on specific facial regions instead of global features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-task attribute recognition methods process entire feature maps, producing redundant features due to reliance on global regions, which limits efficiency and accuracy in face attribute recognition.

Method: Proposes Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN) with two key components: Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) that uses pre-trained keypoint models to localize critical facial parts and generate group masks, and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) that combines group and global features for enhanced learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on two challenging facial attribute recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGMTN in improving FAR performance compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: MGMTN successfully addresses limitations of global feature processing by focusing on specific facial regions, leading to more efficient and accurate face attribute recognition through adaptive mask learning and feature fusion.

Abstract: Face Attribute Recognition (FAR) plays a crucial role in applications such as person re-identification, face retrieval, and face editing. Conventional multi-task attribute recognition methods often process the entire feature map for feature extraction and attribute classification, which can produce redundant features due to reliance on global regions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach emphasizing the selection of specific feature regions for efficient feature learning. We introduce the Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN), which integrates Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) to address the aforementioned limitations. Leveraging a pre-trained keypoint annotation model and a fully convolutional network, AML accurately localizes critical facial parts (e.g., eye and mouth groups) and generates group masks that delineate meaningful feature regions, thereby mitigating negative transfer from global region usage. Furthermore, G2FF combines group and global features to enhance FAR learning, enabling more precise attribute identification. Extensive experiments on two challenging facial attribute recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGMTN in improving FAR performance.

Conclusion: DreamID-V successfully addresses video face swapping challenges by transferring image face swapping superiority to video domain through comprehensive framework design, achieving superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Video Face Swapping (VFS) requires seamlessly injecting a source identity into a target video while meticulously preserving the original pose, expression, lighting, background, and dynamic information. Existing methods struggle to maintain identity similarity and attribute preservation while preserving temporal consistency. To address the challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework to seamlessly transfer the superiority of Image Face Swapping (IFS) to the video domain. We first introduce a novel data pipeline SyncID-Pipe that pre-trains an Identity-Anchored Video Synthesizer and combines it with IFS models to construct bidirectional ID quadruplets for explicit supervision. Building upon paired data, we propose the first Diffusion Transformer-based framework DreamID-V, employing a core Modality-Aware Conditioning module to discriminatively inject multi-model conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a Synthetic-to-Real Curriculum mechanism and an Identity-Coherence Reinforcement Learning strategy to enhance visual realism and identity consistency under challenging scenarios. To address the issue of limited benchmarks, we introduce IDBench-V, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing diverse scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate DreamID-V outperforms state-of-the-art methods and further exhibits exceptional versatility, which can be seamlessly adapted to various swap-related tasks.

*Weiqi Yu,Yiyang Yao,Lin He,Jianming Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeNeRF improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction by using edge-guided depth regularization to preserve geometric boundaries while reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF performance degrades with sparse inputs, and existing global depth regularization methods lose geometric boundary details.

Method: Extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization only to non-edge regions to preserve boundary details while enhancing geometric consistency.

Result: Superior performance on LLFF and DTU datasets, especially in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts; module can be integrated into other methods as plug-and-play.

Conclusion: Edge-guided regularization effectively balances geometric consistency with boundary detail preservation in sparse-view NeRF reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve remarkable performance in dense multi-view scenarios, but their reconstruction quality degrades significantly under sparse inputs due to geometric artifacts. Existing methods utilize global depth regularization to mitigate artifacts, leading to the loss of geometric boundary details. To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

TL;DR: SATS proposes a two-stage Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy for Open-Set Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation, addressing annotation imbalance by first separating known/unknown classes then performing unknown-aware domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage methods for OSDA-SS suffer from negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns due to annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes.

Method: SATS uses a two-step approach: 1) known/unknown separation, 2) unknown-aware domain adaptation. Includes hard unknown exploration data augmentation to expose model to challenging unknowns.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements: +3.85% H-Score for GTA5-to-Cityscapes and +18.64% for SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Separating the tasks of known/unknown separation and domain adaptation leads to more balanced learning and better performance in open-set domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (OSDA-SS) presents a significant challenge, as it requires both domain adaptation for known classes and the distinction of unknowns. Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial advancement, with a +3.85% H-Score improvement for GTA5-to-Cityscapes and +18.64% for SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality part annotations in existing datasets for diverse object categories.

Method: Created PIN++ with 100 annotated images per ImageNet-1K category, trained part segmentation network, generated pseudo labels, and developed Multi-scale Part-supervised Model (MPM) with auxiliary bypass layers.

Result: MPM enhanced part-based models for robust object recognition and established strong baselines for part segmentation, object segmentation, and few-shot learning tasks.

Conclusion: Part annotations significantly improve model performance across multiple downstream tasks, with PIN++ serving as a comprehensive benchmark resource.

Abstract: To address the scarcity of high-quality part annotations in existing datasets, we introduce PartImageNet++ (PIN++), a dataset that provides detailed part annotations for all categories in ImageNet-1K. With 100 annotated images per category, totaling 100K images, PIN++ represents the most comprehensive dataset covering a diverse range of object categories. Leveraging PIN++, we propose a Multi-scale Part-supervised recognition Model (MPM) for robust classification on ImageNet-1K. We first trained a part segmentation network using PIN++ and used it to generate pseudo part labels for the remaining unannotated images. MPM then integrated a conventional recognition architecture with auxiliary bypass layers, jointly supervised by both pseudo part labels and the original part annotations. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on PIN++, including part segmentation, object segmentation, and few-shot learning, exploring various ways to leverage part annotations in downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach not only enhanced part-based models for robust object recognition but also established strong baselines for multiple downstream tasks, highlighting the potential of part annotations in improving model performance.

### [75] [Rethinking Multimodal Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation: From Fused Refinement to Decoupled Arbitration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01456)
*Wentao Bian,Fenglei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-FSS addresses multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation by decoupling semantic and geometric experts to resolve the Plasticity-Stability Dilemma and semantic blindness issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies two key problems in current multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation: 1) The "Plasticity-Stability Dilemma" in "Fuse-then-Refine" paradigms where early fusion creates conflicts, and 2) CLIP's inter-class confusion leading to semantic blindness that hampers generalization.

Method: DA-FSS uses a decoupled architecture with Parallel Expert Refinement module generating separate modal correlations, a Stacked Arbitration Module for convolutional fusion and arbitration, and a Decoupled Alignment Module for knowledge transfer without confusion propagation. The Geometric Expert maintains plasticity while the Semantic Expert ensures stability.

Result: Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show DA-FSS outperforms MM-FSS baseline, with superior geometric boundaries, completeness, and texture differentiation. The model better leverages each modality's information space.

Conclusion: Decoupling semantic and geometric pathways with mutual regularization effectively addresses the Plasticity-Stability Dilemma and semantic blindness, leading to improved generalization in multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-PCS), identifying a conflict in "Fuse-then-Refine" paradigms: the "Plasticity-Stability Dilemma." In addition, CLIP's inter-class confusion can result in semantic blindness. To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion. Experiments on popular datasets (S3DIS, ScanNet) demonstrate the superiority of DA-FSS over MM-FSS. Meanwhile, geometric boundaries, completeness, and texture differentiation are all superior to the baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/MoWenQAQ/DA-FSS.

*Mingxing Zhan,Li Zhang,Beibei Wang,Yingjie Wang,Zenglin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that uses language cues to predict uncertainty-aware bounds for metric depth calibration, then selects image-specific calibration within those bounds using frozen visual features, improving both in-domain accuracy and zero-shot transfer robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular metric depth estimation remains ill-posed due to unidentifiable global scale and heightened domain-shift sensitivity, even though relative-depth foundation models transfer well. Existing methods struggle with noisy language cues that vary with phrasing and missing objects.

Method: Under frozen-backbone calibration setting, recover metric depth via image-specific affine transform in inverse depth. Use language to predict uncertainty-aware envelope bounding feasible calibration parameters rather than text-only point estimate. Then use pooled multi-scale frozen visual features to select image-specific calibration within this envelope. Train lightweight calibration heads while keeping relative-depth backbone and CLIP text encoder fixed, using closed-form least-squares oracle for supervision.

Result: Experiments on NYUv2 and KITTI show improved in-domain accuracy. Zero-shot transfer to SUN-RGBD and DDAD demonstrates improved robustness over strong language-only baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware language-guided calibration method effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of monocular metric depth estimation, leveraging noisy language cues while maintaining robustness through uncertainty modeling and visual feature selection.

Abstract: Relative-depth foundation models transfer well, yet monocular metric depth remains ill-posed due to unidentifiable global scale and heightened domain-shift sensitivity. Under a frozen-backbone calibration setting, we recover metric depth via an image-specific affine transform in inverse depth and train only lightweight calibration heads while keeping the relative-depth backbone and the CLIP text encoder fixed. Since captions provide coarse but noisy scale cues that vary with phrasing and missing objects, we use language to predict an uncertainty-aware envelope that bounds feasible calibration parameters in an unconstrained space, rather than committing to a text-only point estimate. We then use pooled multi-scale frozen visual features to select an image-specific calibration within this envelope. During training, a closed-form least-squares oracle in inverse depth provides per-image supervision for learning the envelope and the selected calibration. Experiments on NYUv2 and KITTI improve in-domain accuracy, while zero-shot transfer to SUN-RGBD and DDAD demonstrates improved robustness over strong language-only baselines.

*Mohd Usama,Belal Ahmad,Christer Gronlund,Faleh Menawer R Althiyabi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed GAN-based domain adaptation method for ultrasound images that translates texture patterns and removes reverberation noise between different imaging devices/settings while preserving image content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging assume same probability distribution between training and test data, but medical images from different systems or settings have diverse textures and noise, causing poor generalization. Retraining for each device/setting is costly.

Method: Formulated domain adaptation as image-to-image translation using GANs. Modified texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in source domain images to align with target domain while keeping image content unchanged. Compared with CycleGAN approaches.

Result: Model successfully translated texture patterns and removed reverberation noise. Achieved superior domain adaptation metrics: histogram correlation (0.960±0.019 & 0.920±0.043) and Bhattacharya distance (0.040±0.020 & 0.085±0.048) vs no adaptation (0.916±0.062 & 0.890±0.077, 0.090±0.070 & 0.121±0.095) on two carotid ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed GAN-based approach effectively addresses domain shift in ultrasound imaging by adapting texture patterns and removing noise, enabling better generalization across different imaging devices/settings without costly retraining.

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively used in medical imaging applications, assuming that the test and training datasets belong to the same probability distribution. However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy and methods effectively address the challenges of coastal video analysis, providing robust, real-time ship detection and tracking that handles dynamic coastal conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust real time detection and tracking method for detecting ships in a coastal video sequences. Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background. Based on geometrical properties of ship and some concepts such as brightness distortion, a new method for backwash cancellation is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and methods have outstanding performance in ship detection and tracking. These results also illustrate real time and precise performance of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: ADPO is a unified RL framework that jointly learns answer generation and self-verification in a single policy, achieving better verification performance and faster inference than separate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel test-time scaling typically requires separate generation and verification models, which leads to high training and inference costs. There's a need for a more efficient unified approach.

Method: ADPO introduces two key innovations: 1) preference verification reward that computes mean verification scores as decision thresholds, and 2) advantage decoupled optimization that computes separate advantages for generation/verification, applies token masks to isolate gradients, and combines masked GRPO objectives.

Result: ADPO achieves up to +34.1% higher verification AUC, -53.5% lower inference time, +2.8%/+1.4% accuracy on MathVista/MMMU, +1.9 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and +1.7%/+1.0% step success rate on AndroidControl/GUI Odyssey.

Conclusion: ADPO provides an effective unified framework that synergistically optimizes generation and verification within a single policy, significantly improving both performance and efficiency compared to separate model approaches.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling typically trains separate generation and verification models, incurring high training and inference costs. We propose Advantage Decoupled Preference Optimization (ADPO), a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns answer generation and self-verification within a single policy. ADPO introduces two innovations: a preference verification reward improving verification capability and a decoupled optimization mechanism enabling synergistic optimization of generation and verification. Specifically, the preference verification reward computes mean verification scores from positive and negative samples as decision thresholds, providing positive feedback when prediction correctness aligns with answer correctness. Meanwhile, the advantage decoupled optimization computes separate advantages for generation and verification, applies token masks to isolate gradients, and combines masked GRPO objectives, preserving generation quality while calibrating verification scores. ADPO achieves up to +34.1% higher verification AUC and -53.5% lower inference time, with significant gains of +2.8%/+1.4% accuracy on MathVista/MMMU, +1.9 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and +1.7%/+1.0% step success rate on AndroidControl/GUI Odyssey.

TL;DR: Extended MixStyle (EM) framework improves Alzheimer's disease classification across different MRI datasets by blending higher-order feature moments to handle domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for AD diagnosis using structural MRI often fail to generalize to new cohorts due to domain shifts from different scanners, protocols, and patient demographics. Single-domain generalization is crucial but underexplored given fragmented AD datasets.

Method: Proposed Extended MixStyle (EM) framework that blends higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations, enabling better domain generalization. Trained on NACC dataset (n=4,647) and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126).

Result: EM improves cross-domain performance by 2.4 percentage points in macro-F1 score on average over state-of-the-art single-domain generalization benchmarks, demonstrating enhanced generalization to unseen cohorts.

Conclusion: Extended MixStyle shows promise for invariant, reliable Alzheimer's disease detection in heterogeneous real-world settings by effectively handling domain shifts through higher-order feature moment blending.

Abstract: Despite progress in deep learning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics, models trained on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) often do not perform well when applied to new cohorts due to domain shifts from varying scanners, protocols and patient demographics. AD, the primary driver of dementia, manifests through progressive cognitive and neuroanatomical changes like atrophy and ventricular expansion, making robust, generalizable classification essential for real-world use. While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion inversion is crucial for controllable image editing but remains challenging due to lack of supervision signals. Existing approximation-based methods sacrifice performance or efficiency.

Method: Proposes DeepInv with: 1) self-supervised objective and data augmentation to generate pseudo noises from real images, 2) iterative multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver for step-by-step noise prediction.

Result: Achieves +40.435% SSIM over EasyInv and +9887.5% speed improvement over ReNoise on COCO dataset, with much better performance and inference speed than existing methods.

Conclusion: DeepInv presents the first trainable solver for diffusion inversion, offering high-quality results and efficiency while providing insights for the community through careful solver design.

Abstract: Diffusion inversion is a task of recovering the noise of an image in a diffusion model, which is vital for controllable diffusion image editing. At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step. The extensive experiments show that our DeepInv can achieve much better performance and inference speed than the compared methods, e.g., +40.435% SSIM than EasyInv and +9887.5% speed than ReNoise on COCO dataset. Moreover, our careful designs of trainable solvers can also provide insights to the community. Codes and model parameters will be released in https://github.com/potato-kitty/DeepInv.

Result: Evaluated on 1,435 multi-center cases: synthetic images were high-quality, student network had fewer parameters and faster inference, outperformed partial combinations on external tests, and achieved accuracy comparable to senior radiologists and superior to junior ones.

Conclusion: The DiffKD-DCIS framework shows significant clinical potential for predicting DCIS upgrade, balancing generalization and computational efficiency while achieving radiologist-level performance.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the upgrade of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is crucial for surgical planning. However, traditional deep learning methods face challenges due to limited ultrasound data and poor generalization ability. This study proposes the DiffKD-DCIS framework, integrating conditional diffusion modeling with teacher-student knowledge distillation.
  The framework operates in three stages: First, a conditional diffusion model generates high-fidelity ultrasound images using multimodal conditions for data augmentation. Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.
  Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality. The student network had fewer parameters and faster inference. On external test sets, it outperformed partial combinations, and its accuracy was comparable to senior radiologists and superior to junior ones, showing significant clinical potential.

TL;DR: VideoSpeculateRAG: Efficient VLM-based RAG framework using speculative decoding and similarity filtering to boost speed and accuracy in knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with integrating external knowledge efficiently, and current RAG methods are inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality.

Method: Two key ideas: 1) Speculative decoding pipeline with lightweight draft model generating answer candidates verified by heavyweight model; 2) Similarity-based filtering strategy to correct entity recognition errors in retrieved knowledge.

Result: Achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x.

Conclusion: Combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning enhances efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual reasoning but still struggle with integrating external knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

TL;DR: BARE is a bias-aware and reasoning-enhanced framework for visual grounding that addresses over-entangled multimodal representations and insufficient semantic reasoning through modality-specific feature preservation and referential semantic construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-tower visual grounding architectures suffer from two main limitations: (1) over-entangled multimodal representations that exacerbate deceptive modality biases, and (2) insufficient semantic reasoning that hinders comprehension of referential cues.

Method: BARE introduces a mechanism that preserves modality-specific features and constructs referential semantics through three novel modules: (i) language salience modulator, (ii) visual bias correction, and (iii) referential relationship enhancement, which jointly mitigate multimodal distractions and enhance referential comprehension.

Result: Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that BARE achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers superior computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: BARE provides an effective solution for visual grounding by addressing modality bias and enhancing semantic reasoning, with publicly available code for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG), which aims to locate a specific region referred to by expressions, is a fundamental yet challenging task in the multimodal understanding fields. While recent grounding transfer works have advanced the field through one-tower architectures, they still suffer from two primary limitations: (1) over-entangled multimodal representations that exacerbate deceptive modality biases, and (2) insufficient semantic reasoning that hinders the comprehension of referential cues. In this paper, we propose BARE, a bias-aware and reasoning-enhanced framework for one-tower visual grounding. BARE introduces a mechanism that preserves modality-specific features and constructs referential semantics through three novel modules: (i) language salience modulator, (ii) visual bias correction and (iii) referential relationship enhancement, which jointly mitigate multimodal distractions and enhance referential comprehension.

*Zixuan Fu,Lanqing Guo,Chong Wang,Binbin Song,Ding Liu,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReToK is a flexible image tokenizer that uses redundant token padding and hierarchical semantic regularization to distribute image information across all tokens, improving autoregressive image generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flexible tokenizers using nested dropout concentrate image information in early tokens, limiting effectiveness for autoregressive image generation as token length increases.

Method: Proposes ReToK with two key components: 1) Redundant Token Padding to activate tail tokens more frequently, and 2) Hierarchical Semantic Regularization that aligns earlier tokens with pre-trained vision foundation model features while reducing regularization strength toward tail tokens.

Result: Achieves superior generation performance on ImageNet 256×256 compared to both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

Conclusion: ReToK effectively overcomes limitations of existing flexible tokenizers by distributing image information across all tokens, enabling better latent modeling for autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Flexible image tokenizers aim to represent an image using an ordered 1D variable-length token sequence. This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \underline{Re}dundant \underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

TL;DR: Introduces Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI) combining physical dynamics and human intent reasoning, with EscherVerse benchmark/dataset/models for evaluating spatial intelligence in human-centric scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research overlooks human intent behind spatial changes, focusing only on physical dynamics without considering the purposes driving those changes.

Method: Proposes Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI) paradigm with two pillars: Physical-Dynamic Reasoning and Intent-Driven Reasoning. Creates EscherVerse including Escher-Bench benchmark, Escher-35k dataset, and Escher series models derived from real-world videos.

Result: First benchmark to systematically assess Intent-Driven Reasoning, evaluating object permanence, state transitions, trajectory prediction in dynamic human-centric scenarios. Provides novel data curation pipeline for real-world video analysis.

Conclusion: EscherVerse advances spatial intelligence from passive scene description toward holistic, purpose-driven understanding of the world, providing foundational resource for TSI research.

Abstract: The ability to reason about spatial dynamics is a cornerstone of intelligence, yet current research overlooks the human intent behind spatial changes. To address these limitations, we introduce Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI), a new paradigm that unifies two critical pillars: Physical-Dynamic Reasoning--understanding the physical principles of object interactions--and Intent-Driven Reasoning--inferring the human goals behind these actions. To catalyze research in TSI, we present EscherVerse, consisting of a large-scale, open-world benchmark (Escher-Bench), a dataset (Escher-35k), and models (Escher series). Derived from real-world videos, EscherVerse moves beyond constrained settings to explicitly evaluate an agent's ability to reason about object permanence, state transitions, and trajectory prediction in dynamic, human-centric scenarios. Crucially, it is the first benchmark to systematically assess Intent-Driven Reasoning, challenging models to connect physical events to their underlying human purposes. Our work, including a novel data curation pipeline, provides a foundational resource to advance spatial intelligence from passive scene description toward a holistic, purpose-driven understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-AMTN: Attention-based multi-task network for face attribute recognition with weight-sharing attention, cross-group feature fusion, and dynamic weighting to improve generalization with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-task networks for face attribute recognition suffer from exponential parameter growth with added tasks and limited high-level feature interaction, which hinders exploration of semantic relations between attributes and negatively affects generalization performance.

Method: Proposes FAR-AMTN with three key components: 1) Weight-Shared Group-Specific Attention (WSGSA) module with shared parameters to reduce complexity while improving group feature representation, 2) Cross-Group Feature Fusion (CGFF) module to enable interactions between attribute groups for enhanced feature learning, and 3) Dynamic Weighting Strategy (DWS) for synchronized task convergence.

Result: Experiments on CelebA and LFWA datasets show that FAR-AMTN achieves superior accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing models.

Conclusion: FAR-AMTN effectively addresses the limitations of traditional multi-task networks by enabling better feature sharing and interaction while controlling parameter growth, leading to improved generalization performance in face attribute recognition.

Abstract: To enhance the generalization performance of Multi-Task Networks (MTN) in Face Attribute Recognition (FAR), it is crucial to share relevant information across multiple related prediction tasks effectively. Traditional MTN methods create shared low-level modules and distinct high-level modules, causing an exponential increase in model parameters with the addition of tasks. This approach also limits feature interaction at the high level, hindering the exploration of semantic relations among attributes, thereby affecting generalization negatively. In response, this study introduces FAR-AMTN, a novel Attention Multi-Task Network for FAR. It incorporates a Weight-Shared Group-Specific Attention (WSGSA) module with shared parameters to minimize complexity while improving group feature representation. Furthermore, a Cross-Group Feature Fusion (CGFF) module is utilized to foster interactions between attribute groups, enhancing feature learning. A Dynamic Weighting Strategy (DWS) is also introduced for synchronized task convergence. Experiments on the CelebA and LFWA datasets demonstrate that the proposed FAR-AMTN demonstrates superior accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALCON is a cross-domain few-shot 3D medical segmentation framework that processes 3D volumes as 2D slices, achieving superior boundary accuracy with minimal labeled data and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise 3D medical segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment but faces challenges including scarcity of 3D annotations, patient variability, data privacy concerns, and high computational costs.

Method: Meta-training on natural images to learn generalizable segmentation priors, then adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning for medical domain adaptation. Task-aware inference dynamically adapts to patient-specific variations across slices.

Result: Achieves lowest Hausdorff Distance scores (superior boundary accuracy) while maintaining comparable Dice Similarity Coefficient to state-of-the-art models on four benchmarks, using significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: FALCON provides a clinically viable solution for 3D medical segmentation that addresses key practical challenges including annotation scarcity, computational efficiency, and patient-specific variability.

Abstract: Precise delineation of anatomical and pathological structures within 3D medical volumes is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective surgical planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.

*Haonan Cai,Yuxuan Luo,Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAR-Font is an autoregressive framework for few-shot font generation that uses global-aware tokenization, multimodal style encoding with language guidance, and post-refinement to improve structural integrity and stylistic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot font generation methods struggle with preserving structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. Autoregressive models are constrained by patch-level tokenization that ignores global dependencies, and current approaches rely only on visual references, overlooking language's role in conveying stylistic intent during font design.

Method: Proposes GAR-Font with three key components: 1) Global-aware tokenizer capturing both local structures and global stylistic patterns, 2) Multimodal style encoder with lightweight language-style adapter for flexible style control without intensive multimodal pretraining, and 3) Post-refinement pipeline to enhance structural fidelity and style coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show GAR-Font outperforms existing few-shot font generation methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.

Conclusion: GAR-Font addresses limitations in current font generation by integrating global-aware tokenization, multimodal style control through language, and refinement techniques, demonstrating superior performance in preserving both structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references.

Abstract: Manual font design is an intricate process that transforms a stylistic visual concept into a coherent glyph set. This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation. GAR-Font introduces a global-aware tokenizer that effectively captures both local structures and global stylistic patterns, a multimodal style encoder offering flexible style control through a lightweight language-style adapter without requiring intensive multimodal pretraining, and a post-refinement pipeline that further enhances structural fidelity and style coherence. Extensive experiments show that GAR-Font outperforms existing FFG methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.

TL;DR: Sparse Guidance (SG) improves inference efficiency for sparsely-trained diffusion models by using token-level sparsity instead of conditional dropout, achieving better quality with fewer FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparsely trained diffusion models are cheaper to train but struggle during inference due to poor response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG), leading to underwhelming performance.

Method: Proposes Sparse Guidance (SG) which uses token-level sparsity instead of conditional dropout to guide diffusion models, preserving high-variance conditional predictions and enabling efficient inference.

Result: Achieves 1.58 FID on ImageNet-256 with 25% fewer FLOPs, up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality, and improves composition/human preference scores for a 2.5B text-to-image model while increasing throughput.

Conclusion: Sparse Guidance enables efficient inference for sparsely-trained diffusion models by addressing CFG limitations, delivering high-quality outputs with significant computational savings.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver high quality in image synthesis but remain expensive during training and inference. Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Sparse Guidance, we train a 2.5B text-to-image diffusion model using training time sparsity and leverage SG during inference. SG achieves improvements in composition and human preference score while increasing throughput at the same time.

TL;DR: Subimage Overlap Prediction is a novel SSL method for remote sensing segmentation that uses less pretraining data by predicting where sub-images fit within original images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SSL methods require vast pretraining data, which is problematic for remote sensing where labeled data is scarce. Need efficient SSL that works with limited pretraining imagery.

Method: Extract sub-images from remote sensing images, then train model to predict semantic mask of where sub-image fits within original image. Creates self-supervised task for segmentation.

Result: Faster convergence, equal/better mIoU on downstream segmentation tasks. Performance gap widens with less labeled data. Works across architectures and datasets with less pretraining data than other SSL methods.

Conclusion: Subimage Overlap Prediction is an effective SSL approach for remote sensing segmentation that reduces pretraining data requirements while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have become a dominant paradigm for creating general purpose models whose capabilities can be transferred to downstream supervised learning tasks. However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods for CT IQA are under-explored and often introduce bias by using idealized definitions that don't reflect real-world degradations like noise, motion artifacts, and scanner variability.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Prompt-guided IQA (CAP-IQA) framework that combines CNN-based visual encoder with domain-specific text encoder, integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts, and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual degradations.

Result: Achieves overall correlation score of 2.8590 on 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, surpassing top-ranked team by 4.24%. Also demonstrates generalizability on in-house dataset of 91,514 pediatric CT images.

Conclusion: CAP-IQA effectively integrates medical priors through prompts while addressing bias from idealized definitions, showing superior performance and generalizability for CT image quality assessment across different patient populations.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods, which encode medical priors through descriptive text, have been only minimally explored for CT Image Quality Assessment (IQA). While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability. Furthermore, evaluation on an in-house dataset of 91,514 pediatric CT images demonstrates the true generalizability of CAP-IQA in assessing perceptual fidelity in a different patient population.

We adapt and enhance a state-of-the-art modeling approach originally designed for audio-based differentiation to suit visual inputs effectively. This cross-modal transfer significantly improves our model's accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: LUMPNet provides an effective hybrid deep learning solution for early LSD detection with high accuracy, demonstrating potential for practical deployment to combat livestock disease outbreaks and protect food security.

Abstract: Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a contagious viral infection that significantly deteriorates livestock health, thereby posing a serious threat to the global economy and food security. Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet. The results show that LUMPNet achieves superior performance.

*Aymen Mir,Riza Alp Guler,Jian Wang,Gerard Pons-Moll,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM) enable consistent lighting and shadows for 3D Gaussian Splatting avatars interacting with scenes using volumetric shadow computation without meshing, combined with spherical harmonic relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for consistent lighting and shadows when animated 3D Gaussian Splatting avatars interact with 3DGS scenes or dynamic objects in static scenes, avoiding the limitations of traditional meshing approaches.

Method: Developed Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM) as a volumetric shadow mapping algorithm for 3DGS, using closed-form light accumulation along rays and storing transmittance in octahedral atlases. For relighting, approximated local environment illumination with HDRI probes in spherical harmonic basis and applied per-Gaussian radiance transfer.

Result: Demonstrated environment-consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ composited into various scenes (ScanNet++, DL3DV, SuperSplat), showing coherent shadows and relighting in both single and multi-avatar settings without meshing.

Conclusion: DGSM and SH relighting operate fully within the volumetric 3DGS representation, enabling coherent shadows and relighting for animated avatars interacting with scenes while avoiding the need for meshing.

Abstract: We present a method for consistent lighting and shadows when animated 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatars interact with 3DGS scenes or with dynamic objects inserted into otherwise static scenes. Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization. We demonstrate environment consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ, composited into ScanNet++, DL3DV, and SuperSplat scenes, and show interactions with inserted objects. Across single and multi avatar settings, DGSM and SH relighting operate fully in the volumetric 3DGS representation, yielding coherent shadows and relighting while avoiding meshing.

TL;DR: Proposed RSwinV2, a customized SwinTransformerV2 with Inverse Residual Blocks, achieves 96.21% accuracy for Mpox lesion classification, outperforming CNNs and standard SwinTransformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Mpox diagnosis by improving lesion classification capability, addressing challenges like lesion variability and similarity to other diseases (chickenpox, measles, cowpox).

Method: Customized hierarchical transformer architecture with patch splitting, shifted window attention, patch/position embeddings, and novel Inverse Residual Blocks (IRB) with convolutional skip connections to address vanishing gradients.

Result: Achieved 96.21% accuracy and 95.62 F1-score on Kaggle public dataset, outperforming standard CNN models and SwinTransformers.

Conclusion: RSwinV2 proves effective as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion interpretation, successfully linking global and local patterns to improve classification of similar-looking skin diseases.

Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogFlow is a cognitive-inspired three-stage framework for visual mathematical problem solving that addresses the gap between visual perception and reasoning by adding a knowledge internalization stage and holistic enhancements across perception, internalization, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with visual mathematical problem solving because they focus only on improving visual extraction/interpretation while ignoring whether extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning.

Method: CogFlow introduces a three-stage framework (perception→internalization→reasoning) with: 1) Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception in parametric/semantic spaces, 2) Knowledge Internalization Reward model to bridge perception and reasoning, and 3) Visual-Gated Policy Optimization to enforce visual grounding. Also creates MathCog dataset with 120K+ perception-reasoning aligned annotations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of CogFlow over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The cognitive-inspired hierarchical approach with explicit knowledge internalization stage effectively addresses the visual perception-reasoning gap in multimodal mathematical problem solving, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.

TL;DR: A trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework using long-sequence multi-scale temporal modeling achieves high accuracy (F1=0.90) for western Canada wildfires while quantifying uncertainty and enabling process interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire intensification in western Canada causes substantial losses, but accurate prediction is hindered by stochastic ignition/spread and complex nonlinear interactions among multiple drivers, challenging reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models.

Method: Proposed trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling that integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation.

Result: Model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving F1 score of 0.90 and PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty analysis reveals spatial/seasonal patterns in predictive confidence. SHAP interpretation shows temperature drivers dominate risk, with moisture constraints playing stronger role in 2024 spatial contrasts.

Conclusion: The framework provides accurate, computationally efficient wildfire risk prediction with uncertainty quantification and mechanistic interpretation capabilities, offering valuable insights for wildfire management in western Canada's changing climate.

Abstract: In recent decades, the intensification of wildfire activity in western Canada has resulted in substantial socio-economic and environmental losses. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and its incidence is rising globally. While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

*Afzal Hossain,Mst Rumana Sumi,Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face recognition for infants/toddlers is challenging due to rapid facial changes. Performance improves with age (30.7% TAR at 0-6 months vs 64.7% at 2.5-3 years). DANN reduces embedding drift, improving TAR by 12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant/toddler face recognition faces unique challenges: rapid facial morphology changes, high inter-class similarity, and limited dataset availability. This is critical for biometric systems in smart city applications like public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services.

Method: Evaluated four deep learning models (FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, CosFace) on a longitudinal dataset collected over 24 months in seven sessions with children aged 0-3 years. Applied Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to mitigate embedding drift across time intervals.

Result: Recognition accuracy improves significantly with age: 30.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR for 0-6 months, increasing to 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR for 2.5-3 years. Shorter time gaps yield higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. DANN improved TAR by over 12% by creating more temporally stable features.

Conclusion: Infant/toddler face recognition is challenging but improves with age. DANN effectively reduces temporal drift. Future research should focus on privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems that address temporal variability for secure urban applications where child verification is essential.

Abstract: Face recognition for infants and toddlers presents unique challenges due to rapid facial morphology changes, high inter-class similarity, and limited dataset availability. This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.

TL;DR: LUPI improves object detection by using privileged info (masks, saliency, depth) during training only, via teacher-student architecture, boosting accuracy without increasing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage fine-grained descriptive information available during training but not at inference time to enhance object detection performance without increasing model complexity at deployment.

Method: Model-agnostic teacher-student architecture that injects privileged information (bounding box masks, saliency maps, depth cues) into object detectors during training only.

Result: LUPI-trained detectors consistently outperform baselines across 5 state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, with significant accuracy improvements especially for medium/large objects, no inference cost increase.

Conclusion: LUPI framework provides effective, practical strategy for advancing object detection in resource-constrained and real-world settings by leveraging privileged training information.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.

TL;DR: Synthetic face data can improve temporal robustness in child face recognition by reducing verification errors caused by facial growth over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child face recognition is challenging due to rapid, nonlinear facial growth causing template drift and increasing verification errors over time. Need for methods to improve temporal robustness.

Method: Three settings evaluated on YFA dataset: 1) pretrained MagFace embeddings, 2) MagFace fine-tuned with authentic faces only, 3) MagFace fine-tuned with authentic + synthetic faces. Synthetic data generated using StyleGAN2 ADA with identity-disjoint protocol and post-generation filtering.

Result: Synthetic-augmented fine-tuning substantially reduces error rates across enrollment verification gaps (6-36 months) compared to both pretrained baseline and real-only fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Synthetic data acts as longitudinal stabilizer for child face recognition, providing risk-aware assessment of synthetic augmentation for improving identity persistence in pediatric applications.

Abstract: Longitudinal face recognition in children remains challenging due to rapid and nonlinear facial growth, which causes template drift and increasing verification errors over time. This work investigates whether synthetic face data can act as a longitudinal stabilizer by improving temporal robustness of child face recognition models. Using an identity disjoint protocol on the Young Face Aging (YFA) dataset, we evaluate three settings: (i) pretrained MagFace embeddings without dataset specific fine-tuning, (ii) MagFace fine-tuned using authentic training faces only, and (iii) MagFace fine-tuned using a combination of authentic and synthetically generated training faces. Synthetic data is generated using StyleGAN2 ADA and incorporated exclusively within the training identities; a post generation filtering step is applied to mitigate identity leakage and remove artifact affected samples. Experimental results across enrollment verification gaps from 6 to 36 months show that synthetic-augmented fine tuning substantially reduces error rates relative to both the pretrained baseline and real only fine tuning. These findings provide a risk aware assessment of synthetic augmentation for improving identity persistence in pediatric face recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agentic Retoucher is a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation image correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop to fix small-scale distortions in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models like SDXL and FLUX achieve photorealism but suffer from pervasive small-scale distortions in limbs, faces, text, etc. Existing refinement approaches either require costly iterative regeneration or rely on vision-language models with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits.

Method: A hierarchical decision-driven framework with three agents: (1) perception agent learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization using text-image consistency cues, (2) reasoning agent performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) action agent adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. Also introduces GenBlemish-27K dataset with 6K T2I images and 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization, and human preference alignment.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable text-to-image generation by integrating perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified decision process.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as SDXL and FLUX have achieved impressive photorealism, yet small-scale distortions remain pervasive in limbs, face, text and so on. Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active learning framework (LH3D) selects roadside-only scenes that are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples to achieve high 3D detection performance with only 25% annotation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world roadside perception deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints, but many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view, making accurate labeling difficult and costly.

Method: Proposes LH3D, a learnability-driven active learning framework for roadside monocular 3D object detection that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage.

Result: Achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively using only 25% of annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I dataset, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines.

Conclusion: Learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception; the proposed framework effectively reduces wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while obtaining high-performing models.

Abstract: Roadside perception datasets are typically constructed via cooperative labeling between synchronized vehicle and roadside frame pairs. However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines. This confirms that learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception.

TL;DR: A new guidance-free First-Frame Propagation method using a large-scale dataset (FFP-300K) and novel architecture (AST-RoPE) with self-distillation for better video editing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing First-Frame Propagation methods rely on cumbersome run-time guidance due to inadequate training datasets that are too short, low-resolution, and lack task diversity for robust temporal priors.

Method: 1) Introduce FFP-300K dataset (300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p, 81 frames) for diverse local/global edits; 2) Propose guidance-free FFP framework with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE) to disentangle appearance/motion references; 3) Use self-distillation with identity propagation task as regularizer for temporal stability.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing academic and commercial models on EditVerseBench benchmark, achieving ~0.2 PickScore and ~0.3 VLM score improvement against competitors.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses foundational data limitations and architectural challenges in First-Frame Propagation, enabling guidance-free video editing with superior performance through large-scale dataset creation and novel disentanglement techniques.

Abstract: First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift.

TL;DR: Weak temporal supervision for semantic change detection using existing single-temporal datasets without new annotations, achieving strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic change detection in remote sensing is limited by scarce annotated datasets due to costly pixel-level annotation. Existing methods using synthetic data have limited out-of-domain generalization.

Method: Extend single-date datasets with new temporal observations, train by assuming real bi-temporal pairs contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. Use object-aware change map generation and iterative refinement to handle weak label noise.

Result: Validated on extended FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across benchmarks. Showcased scalability over large areas in France.

Conclusion: Weak temporal supervision strategy effectively addresses annotation scarcity in semantic change detection, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability potential without requiring new annotations.

Abstract: Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method.

*Lintong Wei,Jian Lu,Haozhe Cheng,Jihua Zhu,Kaibing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-SRA improves 3D representation learning by using multi-level masking ratios and probabilistic reconstruction with MeanFlow Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked autoencoder methods for 3D point clouds use fixed mask ratios that neglect multi-level representational correlations and geometric structures, and rely on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with point cloud diversity.

Method: Proposes Point-SRA with: 1) Different masking ratios in MAE to capture complementary geometric/semantic information, 2) MeanFlow Transformer using cross-modal conditional embeddings for diverse probabilistic reconstruction, 3) Dual Self-Representation Alignment at both MAE and MFT levels, and 4) Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture.

Result: Outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN, achieves 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms in intracranial aneurysm segmentation, and reaches 47.3% AP@50 for 3D object detection (surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%).

Conclusion: Point-SRA effectively addresses limitations of fixed-mask-ratio MAEs by capturing multi-level representations through complementary masking strategies and probabilistic modeling, demonstrating superior performance across diverse 3D understanding tasks.

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%.

*Sunny Gupta,Shounak Das,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiPrompt: A bilateral prompt optimization framework that simultaneously debiases both visual and textual modalities in vision-language models during test-time adaptation, improving robustness to spurious correlations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language foundation models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but remain vulnerable to spurious correlations across modalities. Existing debiasing methods often focus on only one modality (visual OR textual), leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts.

Method: BiPrompt uses a bilateral approach: (1) Visual side: structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. (2) Textual side: balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Both modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions.

Result: Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks show consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods.

Conclusion: BiPrompt establishes a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation, enabling debiasing without retraining or domain supervision by simultaneously addressing spurious correlations in both visual and textual modalities.

Abstract: Vision language foundation models such as CLIP exhibit impressive zero-shot generalization yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations across visual and textual modalities. Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO introduces a two-stage framework for natural 3D conversational head generation using pure image-level supervision, avoiding error-prone pseudo-3D labels, with a new high-quality dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on single-speaker scenarios and lack natural bidirectional listen-and-speak interaction. Existing approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics in conversational settings.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Diffusion-based transformer with dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio, 2) Fast 3D Gaussian Renderer generates high-fidelity images for 2D-level photometric supervision through alternate training, using pure image-level supervision.

Result: Achieves exceptional accuracy and realism in modeling two-person 3D dialogue motion, significantly advancing fidelity and controllability of audio-driven talking heads. Introduces MANGO-Dialog dataset with 50+ hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities.

Conclusion: MANGO successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging pure image-level supervision and alternate training to achieve better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors, enabling seamless transitions between speaking and listening states.

Abstract: Current audio-driven 3D head generation methods mainly focus on single-speaker scenarios, lacking natural, bidirectional listen-and-speak interaction. Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional accuracy and realism in modeling two-person 3D dialogue motion, significantly advancing the fidelity and controllability of audio-driven talking heads.

TL;DR: NextFlow is a unified autoregressive transformer that achieves fast, high-quality multimodal generation using next-scale prediction for images instead of traditional raster-scan approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model for multimodal understanding and generation that addresses the distinct nature of modalities - text being strictly sequential while images are inherently hierarchical - enabling faster and more efficient visual generation.

Method: Uses a unified decoder-only autoregressive transformer trained on 6T interleaved text-image tokens, with next-token prediction for text but next-scale prediction for visual generation (departing from raster-scan methods). Includes robust training recipe for multi-scale generation stability and prefix-tuning for reinforcement learning.

Result: Generates 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds (orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models), achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models, and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.

Conclusion: NextFlow demonstrates that unified autoregressive architectures with modality-appropriate prediction strategies can achieve both fast generation and high-quality multimodal capabilities, bridging the gap between unified models and specialized approaches.

Abstract: We present NextFlow, a unified decoder-only autoregressive transformer trained on 6 trillion interleaved text-image discrete tokens. By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.

TL;DR: A clinical pathology pipeline using standardized templates to extract diagnostic features, creating vision-language datasets and a dual-stream WSI question-answering model that outperforms SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically collect and structure pathological information from pathology reports for clinical applications, addressing the need for standardized extraction of diagnostic elements and enabling vision-language alignment in computational pathology.

Method: 1) Designed Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) based on CAP Cancer Protocols for standardized feature extraction; 2) Created CTIS-Align dataset (80k slide-description pairs) and CTIS-Bench VQA benchmark (977 WSIs, 14,879 QA pairs); 3) Proposed CTIS-QA model with dual-stream architecture: global slide-level context via clustering-based aggregation and local region focus via attention-guided patch perception.

Result: CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks. The pipeline was validated on TCGA-BRCA dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed clinical diagnosis template-based pipeline enables systematic pathological information collection and structured feature extraction. The CTIS-QA model effectively mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach through its dual-stream architecture, demonstrating superior performance on vision-language and diagnostic tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a clinical diagnosis template-based pipeline to systematically collect and structure pathological information. In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach. One stream captures global slide-level context via clustering-based feature aggregation, while the other focuses on salient local regions through attention-guided patch perception module. Extensive experiments on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks show that CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: RetinexEVSR is an event-driven low-light video super-resolution framework that combines Retinex priors with bidirectional cross-modal fusion between degraded RGB frames and high-contrast event signals to restore fine details in low-light videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light video super-resolution methods struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information in low-light, low-resolution inputs.

Method: Proposes RetinexEVSR with bidirectional cross-modal fusion: 1) illumination-guided event enhancement module that refines event features using Retinex-derived illumination maps, and 2) event-guided reflectance enhancement module that uses enhanced events to recover reflectance details via multi-scale fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, with up to 2.95 dB gain on SDSD benchmark while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods.

Conclusion: RetinexEVSR effectively leverages event signals and Retinex priors through bidirectional fusion to overcome low-light video super-resolution challenges, delivering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper addresses low-light video super-resolution (LVSR), aiming to restore high-resolution videos from low-light, low-resolution (LR) inputs. Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/RetinexEVSR.

TL;DR: Compact 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL + 1.6B Sana1.5 diffusion pipeline achieves state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing with low computational cost (24GB GPU, 4s inference) while matching/exceeding larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models are either too large (6B-20B parameters) for practical deployment or lack real-world quality. There's a need for compact, efficient models that maintain high editing quality while being computationally affordable for research and production use.

Method: Uses a 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide editing instructions and a 1.6B-parameter Sana1.5 diffusion model for image generation. Focuses on architecture optimization, data processing, and training configuration for low-cost inference and strict source consistency.

Result: Matches or exceeds performance of substantially larger baselines on ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks. Particularly strong on source-preserving edits (attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, targeted replacement). Runs on 24GB GPU memory with 4-second inference at 2K resolution on H100.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that compact models (under 4B total parameters) can achieve state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing performance while being computationally efficient, making high-quality editing accessible for research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.

TL;DR: DDNet: Dual-stream graph learning framework for temporal forgery localization that captures both local artifacts and global semantic anomalies to precisely pinpoint tampered video segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC technology enables tampering small video segments, making video-level detection inaccurate. Existing methods fail to capture global anomalies due to local view constraints, requiring better temporal forgery localization.

Method: Proposes DDNet with dual-stream architecture: Temporal Distance Stream for local artifacts and Semantic Content Stream for long-range connections. Includes Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate forgery fingerprints, and Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) for hierarchical feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by ~9% in AP@0.95 on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks, with significant cross-domain robustness improvements.

Conclusion: DDNet effectively addresses limitations of local-view methods by capturing both local and global anomalies, achieving superior temporal forgery localization performance and cross-domain robustness.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.

TL;DR: Comparison of three CNN training paradigms (custom from scratch, pre-trained feature extractor, transfer learning) across five real-world image classification tasks shows transfer learning gives best performance while custom CNNs offer best efficiency-accuracy trade-off for constrained budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a controlled comparison of three common CNN training approaches (custom training from scratch, using pre-trained models as fixed feature extractors, and transfer learning via fine-tuning) across diverse real-world image classification problems, helping practitioners make informed decisions based on performance and efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three CNN paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets: road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, plus efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts.

Result: Transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance across all datasets. Custom CNNs provide the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off, particularly when compute and memory budgets are constrained. The pre-trained feature extractor approach falls between these two in terms of performance-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is recommended for maximum predictive performance, while custom CNNs from scratch offer the most attractive efficiency-accuracy trade-off for resource-constrained applications, providing practical guidance for practitioners choosing among CNN training paradigms.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a standard approach for visual recognition due to their capacity to learn hierarchical representations from raw pixels. In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like SAM show strong zero-shot generalization but struggle with domain-specific semantic segmentation, especially for thin structures (retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (SAR). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Inject Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into frozen ViT encoder, add lightweight spatial convolutional adapter, and optionally use topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice loss for better thin structure segmentation.

Result: Achieves best retina-average Dice and best overall average Dice across 5 benchmarks (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, Kvasir-SEG, SL-SSDD) while training only 5.2% of parameters (~4.9M). Substantially improves accuracy on challenging CHASE_DB1 dataset.

Conclusion: Topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models, demonstrating effective domain adaptation for SAM with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

TL;DR: V-CORE introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for Video-LLMs using learnable spatial aggregation and causality-aware temporal projection to improve video understanding requiring temporal and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with tasks requiring consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence, as their bidirectional projectors blur temporal relationships by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations without respecting video's directional nature.

Method: V-CORE framework with two components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA) adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP) enforces unidirectional information flow using block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token as causal sink.

Result: Achieves 61.2% accuracy on challenging NExT-QA benchmark, remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with significant gains in temporal (+3.5%) and causal reasoning (+5.2%) subcategories.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal ordering constraints are crucial for video understanding, and V-CORE's parameter-efficient design demonstrates strong performance improvements specifically in temporal and causal reasoning tasks while being trainable on a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric visual attention prediction is challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of dynamic egocentric scenes. Scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, motivating a language-guided approach to leverage scene context for more robust predictions.

Method: Proposes a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework with: 1) a context perceiver that summarizes egocentric videos based on language-based scene descriptions to generate context-aware video representations, and 2) two training objectives that encourage focus on target point-of-interest regions while suppressing distractions from irrelevant regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Ego4D and Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness across diverse, dynamic egocentric scenarios.

Conclusion: The language-guided scene context-aware learning framework effectively addresses the challenges of egocentric visual attention prediction by leveraging scene descriptions to generate context-aware representations and training objectives that optimize attention focus, resulting in superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: As the demand for analyzing egocentric videos grows, egocentric visual attention prediction, anticipating where a camera wearer will attend, has garnered increasing attention. However, it remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of dynamic egocentric scenes. Motivated by evidence that scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, in this paper, we present a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework for robust egocentric visual attention prediction. We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention. Extensive experiments on Ego4D and Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness across diverse, dynamic egocentric scenarios.

Conclusion: ESGaussianFace successfully addresses the challenge of generating emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation, offering an efficient framework that produces 3D-consistent, high-quality results with accurate emotional and style features.

Abstract: Most current audio-driven facial animation research primarily focuses on generating videos with neutral emotions. While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of lip movement accuracy, expression variation, and style feature expressiveness.

### [123] [GCR: Geometry-Consistent Routing for Task-Agnostic Continual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01856)
*Joongwon Chae,Lihui Luo,Yang Liu,Runming Wang,Dongmei Yu,Zeming Liang,Xi Yuan,Dayan Zhang,Zhenglin Chen,Peiwu Qin,Ilmoon Chae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCR is a geometry-consistent routing framework for task-agnostic continual anomaly detection that stabilizes expert selection by routing in shared embedding space rather than comparing cross-head anomaly scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods struggle with task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where routing inputs to appropriate experts is unreliable due to incomparable score distributions across categories.

Method: GCR uses geometry-consistent routing in a shared frozen patch-embedding space, minimizing nearest-prototype distances to category-specific prototype banks, then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using standard prototype-based scoring.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show substantial improvements in routing stability, mitigation of continual performance collapse, near-zero forgetting, while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance.

Conclusion: Many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing, and GCR's geometry-consistent approach effectively addresses this issue without requiring end-to-end representation learning.

Abstract: Feature-based anomaly detection is widely adopted in industrial inspection due to the strong representational power of large pre-trained vision encoders. While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.
  We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.
  Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

TL;DR: RRNet is a lightweight real-time video enhancement framework that uses virtual light sources and depth-aware rendering for localized relighting, balancing quality and efficiency for live applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance speed and effective exposure control in real-time video enhancement, especially under uneven lighting conditions in live applications like video conferencing.

Method: RRNet uses a lightweight encoder and prediction head to estimate parameters for minimal virtual light sources, enabling localized relighting through depth-aware rendering without pixel-aligned training data. Includes generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tradeoff between visual quality and efficiency, outperforms prior methods in low-light enhancement, localized illumination adjustment, and glare removal while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: RRNet's interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture make it well-suited for practical applications like video conferencing, AR portrait enhancement, and mobile photography.

Abstract: With the growing demand for real-time video enhancement in live applications, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and effective exposure control, particularly under uneven lighting. We introduce RRNet (Rendering Relighting Network), a lightweight and configurable framework that achieves a state-of-the-art tradeoff between visual quality and efficiency. By estimating parameters for a minimal set of virtual light sources, RRNet enables localized relighting through a depth-aware rendering module without requiring pixel-aligned training data. This object-aware formulation preserves facial identity and supports real-time, high-resolution performance using a streamlined encoder and lightweight prediction head. To facilitate training, we propose a generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline that synthesizes diverse lighting conditions at low cost. With its interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture, RRNet is well suited for practical applications such as video conferencing, AR-based portrait enhancement, and mobile photography. Experiments show that RRNet consistently outperforms prior methods in low-light enhancement, localized illumination adjustment, and glare removal.

TL;DR: EGMT: Entity-guided multi-task learning for infrared/visible image fusion using entity-level text from image captions to reduce semantic noise and improve fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven fusion methods use sentence-level text which introduces semantic noise and fails to fully exploit deeper semantic value of textual information.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Extract entity-level text from image captions to eliminate noise, 2) Parallel multi-task learning with image fusion and multi-label classification using entities as pseudo-labels, 3) Entity-guided cross-modal interactive module for fine-grained visual-text feature interaction.

Result: EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Four public datasets (TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, MSRS) released with entity annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed EGMT framework effectively leverages entity-level textual information to improve infrared and visible image fusion quality through multi-task learning and cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion approaches often rely on textual information at the sentence level, which can lead to semantic noise from redundant text and fail to fully exploit the deeper semantic value of textual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/wyshao-01/EGMT.

TL;DR: FLLP introduces a parent-child learning mechanism in hyperbolic space to prevent catastrophic forgetting in custom diffusion models during sequential concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Custom Diffusion Models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts sequentially, and existing approaches focus only on minimizing interference while ignoring potential positive inter-concept interactions.

Method: Forget Less by Learning from Parents (FLLP) uses a parent-child inter-concept learning mechanism in hyperbolic space (Lorentzian manifold) where previously learned concepts serve as guidance for adapting to new ones, naturally modeling tree-like hierarchies.

Result: FLLP shows consistent improvements in both robustness and generalization across three public datasets and one synthetic benchmark, effectively preserving prior knowledge while integrating new concepts.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic space parent-child learning framework successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting in custom diffusion models by leveraging positive inter-concept interactions through hierarchical relationships.

Abstract: Custom Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer impressive capabilities for personalization in generative modeling, yet they remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts sequentially. Existing approaches primarily focus on minimizing interference between concepts, often neglecting the potential for positive inter-concept interactions. In this work, we present Forget Less by Learning from Parents (FLLP), a novel framework that introduces a parent-child inter-concept learning mechanism in hyperbolic space to mitigate forgetting. By embedding concept representations within a Lorentzian manifold, naturally suited to modeling tree-like hierarchies, we define parent-child relationships in which previously learned concepts serve as guidance for adapting to new ones. Our method not only preserves prior knowledge but also supports continual integration of new concepts. We validate FLLP on three public datasets and one synthetic benchmark, showing consistent improvements in both robustness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative refinement methods for temporal action segmentation fail to explicitly utilize the hierarchical nature of human actions, which is crucial for accurate frame-level labeling.

Method: Proposes HybridTAS framework incorporating both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries into diffusion model denoising. Hyperbolic geometry provides tree-like relationships between embeddings, enabling coarse-to-fine guidance: higher timesteps use abstract action categories (root nodes), lower timesteps use fine-grained classes (leaf nodes).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic-guided denoising for temporal action segmentation.

Conclusion: Incorporating hyperbolic geometry into diffusion models effectively exploits hierarchical action structure, leading to superior temporal action segmentation performance through coarse-to-fine denoising guidance.

Abstract: Temporal action segmentation is a critical task in video understanding, where the goal is to assign action labels to each frame in a video. While recent advances leverage iterative refinement-based strategies, they fail to explicitly utilize the hierarchical nature of human actions. In this work, we propose HybridTAS - a novel framework that incorporates a hybrid of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries into the denoising process of diffusion models to exploit the hierarchical structure of actions. Hyperbolic geometry naturally provides tree-like relationships between embeddings, enabling us to guide the action label denoising process in a coarse-to-fine manner: higher diffusion timesteps are influenced by abstract, high-level action categories (root nodes), while lower timesteps are refined using fine-grained action classes (leaf nodes). Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic-guided denoising for the temporal action segmentation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based image editing methods require time-consuming multi-instruction dataset training and still fail to achieve satisfactory results. Need a more flexible, training-free approach that can handle complex editing tasks through natural conversation.

Method: Uses open-source LLM with specially designed prompt template to analyze user needs, then hierarchically invokes existing advanced editing methods without additional training. Implements plug-and-play invocation system for integrating complex/unseen editing tasks.

Result: Achieves more accurate method invocation with fewer token consumption and higher editing quality across various tasks compared to existing approaches. Framework enables stable, high-quality editing results for complex tasks.

Conclusion: TalkPhoto provides an effective training-free solution for conversational image editing that outperforms existing training-based methods in both efficiency and quality, offering flexible integration of diverse editing techniques.

Abstract: Thanks to the powerful language comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing instruction-based image editing methods have introduced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to promote information exchange between instructions and images, ensuring the controllability and flexibility of image editing. However, these frameworks often build a multi-instruction dataset to train the model to handle multiple editing tasks, which is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also fails to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we present TalkPhoto, a versatile training-free image editing framework that facilitates precise image manipulation through conversational interaction. We instruct the open-source LLM with a specially designed prompt template to analyze user needs after receiving instructions and hierarchically invoke existing advanced editing methods, all without additional training. Moreover, we implement a plug-and-play and efficient invocation of image editing methods, allowing complex and unseen editing tasks to be integrated into the current framework, achieving stable and high-quality editing results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides more accurate invocation with fewer token consumption but also achieves higher editing quality across various image editing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT methods have rigid, task-specific architectures that limit applicability across diverse tasks and flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations, especially as MOT evolves toward more general and multi-modal scenarios.

Method: Proposes AR-MOT: an autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as sequence generation within an LLM framework. Introduces Object Tokenizer for region-level perception, Region-Aware Alignment module to mitigate global-regional feature misalignment, and Temporal Memory Fusion module for long-term tracking by caching historical object tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the approach's feasibility, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating strong extensibility potential.

Conclusion: AR-MOT provides a foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems by enabling integration of new modalities or instructions through simple sequence format modifications without architectural changes, addressing limitations of traditional task-specific approaches.

Abstract: As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods for VQA struggle with balancing knowledge retention, adaptation to new information, and robust feature representation, creating a need for better approaches that can handle these competing requirements effectively.

Method: Proposes MacVQA framework with two key components: 1) fusion of visual and question information with global noise filtering to ensure robust representations, and 2) prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage.

Conclusion: MacVQA effectively balances knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning through its adaptive memory allocation and noise filtering mechanisms.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over multimodal information, combining visual and textual data. With the development of continual learning, significant progress has been made in retaining knowledge and adapting to new information in the VQA domain. However, current methods often struggle with balancing knowledge retention, adaptation, and robust feature representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering. MacVQA fuses visual and question information while filtering noise to ensure robust representations, and employs prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage. These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning. Experiments on ten continual VQA tasks show that MacVQA outperforms existing baselines, achieving 43.38% average accuracy and 2.32% average forgetting on standard tasks, and 42.53% average accuracy and 3.60% average forgetting on novel composition tasks.

TL;DR: Coarse-to-fine face normal estimation method reduces dependency on large paired datasets by first generating coarse normals from small data, then refining them using self-attention to capture long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face normal estimation methods require large-scale paired data for training, which is resource-intensive. The paper aims to reduce this dependency while maintaining high-quality results.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train a neat model on small dataset to produce coarse face normals as exemplars, 2) Use refinement network with self-attention mechanism to map input images and exemplars to high-quality facial normals, capturing long-range dependencies to fix local artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method reduces training data requirements and computational resources while achieving superior estimation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The coarse-to-fine approach with logical function split effectively reduces dependency on massive paired data and computational resources while producing high-quality face normal estimates, demonstrated through experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Although recent approaches to face normal estimation have achieved promising results, their effectiveness heavily depends on large-scale paired data for training. This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and reveal its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both training expense as well as estimation quality.

TL;DR: MotionAdapter enables robust motion transfer in diffusion-based video generation by disentangling motion from appearance and customizing motion to target content using attention-derived motion fields and DINO-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion-based text-to-video models have advanced significantly, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging due to difficulties in disentangling motion from appearance and adapting motion to different content semantics.

Method: MotionAdapter uses 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields, then employs a DINO-guided motion customization module to rearrange and refine these fields based on content correspondences between reference and target videos, finally guiding the DiT denoising process with customized motion.

Result: Extensive experiments show MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and naturally supports complex motion transfer and editing tasks like zooming.

Conclusion: MotionAdapter provides an effective framework for content-aware motion transfer in DiT-based video generation by explicitly disentangling motion from appearance and adaptively customizing motion to target content.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video models, particularly those built on the diffusion transformer architecture, have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality and temporally coherent videos. However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences. The customized motion field is then used to guide the DiT denoising process, ensuring that the synthesized video inherits the reference motion while preserving target appearance and semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, MotionAdapter naturally supports complex motion transfer and motion editing tasks such as zooming.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFTER is a novel method that uses factual textual semantics to guide activation editing in Large Vision-Language Models, reducing object hallucination by up to 16.3% through adaptive visual-textual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination (category, attribute, relation) due to language bias, which hinders trustworthy AI applications. Current editing approaches fail to leverage factual textual semantics to explicitly address this bias.

Method: AFTER combines Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) to provide factual guidance for activation editing, and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO) to create query-specific editing from general steering vectors, enabling adaptive visual-textual alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three LVLMs show AFTER's effectiveness, achieving up to 16.3% reduction in hallucination over baselines on the AMBER benchmark.

Conclusion: AFTER successfully mitigates object hallucination in LVLMs by adaptively guiding biased activations toward factual semantics through explicit visual-textual association modeling and query-aware editing.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in cross-modal tasks. However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark. Our code and data will be released for reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing custom diffusion models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts sequentially, and prior works neglect inter-concept interactions and assume fixed concept order.

Method: Proposes FL2T framework with set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, enabling concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while preserving old knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments across three datasets show significant improvement in concept retention, mitigating catastrophic forgetting with at least 2% average gain in CLIP Image Alignment scores across ten tasks.

Conclusion: Inter-concept catalytic behavior is effective for incremental concept learning, enabling better knowledge retention and transfer while overcoming limitations of sequential learning approaches.

Abstract: Custom Diffusion Models (CDMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable ability to personalize generative processes. However, existing CDMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when continuously learning new concepts. Most prior works attempt to mitigate this issue under the sequential learning setting with a fixed order of concept inflow and neglect inter-concept interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce a set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, facilitating improved knowledge retention and transfer. By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones. Extensive experiments, across three datasets, demonstrates that our method significantly improves concept retention and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the effectiveness of inter-concept catalytic behavior in incremental concept learning of ten tasks with at least 2% gain on average CLIP Image Alignment scores.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs enhanced with object-centric blueprints for spatial reasoning, using JSON-style structured representations, supervised fine-tuning with reasoning traces, reinforcement learning with blueprint-aware rewards, and anti-shortcut data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning approaches either focus too much on local patches (weakening global awareness) or isolated coordinates (overlooking overall organization). Need to advance VLMs from visual perception to spatial semantic understanding by integrating cognitive concepts of object-centric representations.

Method: 1) Construct JSON-style blueprints recording object positions, sizes, and attributes; 2) Blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning; 3) Blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage appropriate object inclusion and answer alignment; 4) Anti-shortcut data augmentation with targeted perturbations to discourage superficial cue reliance.

Result: Method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models in experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating object-centric blueprints into VLMs effectively enhances spatial reasoning by providing structured representations that capture both local details and global organization, advancing models from visual perception to spatial semantic understanding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning -- the ability to perceive and reason about relationships in space -- advances vision-language models (VLMs) from visual perception toward spatial semantic understanding. Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.

TL;DR: API framework with automatic haze generation and density-aware removal achieves SOTA real-world dehazing via adaptive patch importance and multi-negative contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based dehazing methods degrade on complex real-world scenes due to limited training data and complex haze density distributions.

Method: API framework with Automatic Haze Generation (AHG) for hybrid data augmentation, Density-aware Haze Removal (DHR) for adaptive patch importance, and Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss for spatial/frequency domain optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world benchmarks with strong quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality, showing robust generalization across diverse haze distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed API framework effectively addresses real-world dehazing challenges through comprehensive data augmentation, adaptive processing, and advanced loss functions.

Abstract: Real-world image dehazing is a fundamental yet challenging task in low-level vision. Existing learning-based methods often suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to complex real-world hazy scenes, primarily due to limited training data and the intrinsic complexity of haze density distributions.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Adaptive Patch Importance-aware (API) framework for generalizable real-world image dehazing. Specifically, our framework consists of an Automatic Haze Generation (AHG) module and a Density-aware Haze Removal (DHR) module. AHG provides a hybrid data augmentation strategy by generating realistic and diverse hazy images as additional high-quality training data. DHR considers hazy regions with varying haze density distributions for generalizable real-world image dehazing in an adaptive patch importance-aware manner. To alleviate the ambiguity of the dehazed image details, we further introduce a new Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss, which fully utilizes information from multiple negative samples across both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world benchmarks, delivering strong results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality, and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse haze distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that enhances nighttime hazy images by mutually reinforcing haze and low-light priors using multi-level experts across visual and frequency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods address only single degradation types (haze or low-light) separately, ignoring their interplay, which limits visibility improvement in nighttime hazy images where both degradations co-exist.

Method: Proposes a framework with image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts operating across visual and frequency domains to recover global structure, regional patterns, and fine details progressively. Uses a frequency-aware router to adaptively guide expert contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively. The model also demonstrates generalizability to daytime dehazing and low-light enhancement tasks.

Conclusion: Mutually reinforcing haze and low-light priors through multi-level experts across domains effectively addresses the complex degradation in nighttime hazy images, outperforming existing single-degradation approaches.

Abstract: Enhancing the visibility of nighttime hazy images is challenging due to the complex degradation distributions. Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively. A frequency-aware router is further introduced to adaptively guide the contribution of each expert, ensuring robust image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showcase the generalizability of our model in daytime dehazing and low-light enhancement tasks.

TL;DR: GleSAM++ enhances SAMs' segmentation robustness on low-quality images using generative latent space enhancement with degradation-aware adaptive reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAMs perform poorly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their real-world applicability. Existing approaches lack explicit degradation guidance, forcing models to implicitly fit complex noise distributions.

Method: Proposes GleSAM++ with three key components: 1) Generative Latent space Enhancement for robustness, 2) Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE) for compatibility, and 3) Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism that decouples reconstruction into degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction.

Result: Significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Performs well on unseen degradations with minimal additional parameters, applicable to both SAM and SAM2.

Conclusion: GleSAM++ effectively addresses SAMs' limitations on low-quality images through degradation-aware enhancement, demonstrating versatility across various image qualities and degradations with efficient optimization.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAMs), known for their exceptional zero-shot segmentation performance, have garnered significant attention in the research community. Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAE enhances Depth Anything foundation model for robust depth estimation in adverse conditions using event-guided spatiotemporal fusion with entropy-aware spatial fusion and motion-guided temporal correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth foundation models like Depth Anything work well in ideal scenes but struggle under adverse conditions (extreme illumination, motion blur) that corrupt visual signals. While event cameras can help with their high dynamic range, existing fusion models fail to inherit the open-world knowledge and generalization of foundation models.

Method: ADAE framework with two key components: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion - adaptively merges frame-based and event-based features using information entropy to indicate illumination degradation; 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction - uses event-based motion cues to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. These components work complementarily within a unified framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in enhancing Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions.

Conclusion: ADAE successfully enhances the Depth Anything foundation model for robust depth estimation in degraded scenes by leveraging event-guided spatiotemporal fusion while preserving the model's open-world knowledge and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Robust depth estimation under dynamic and adverse lighting conditions is essential for robotic systems. Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: Existing VTOFF methods struggle with texture attenuation during generation, failing to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details due to lightweight feature extraction modules.

Method: Proposes AlignVTOFF with a Reference U-Net for multi-scale feature extraction and geometric fidelity, plus Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA) that injects reference features into a frozen denoising U-Net using hybrid attention (trainable cross-attention + frozen self-attention).

Result: Extensive experiments show AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garments with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.

Conclusion: AlignVTOFF effectively addresses texture attenuation in VTOFF by aligning texture and spatial cues, enabling robust modeling of deformation while preserving complex structured patterns and fine-grained details.

Abstract: Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) is a challenging multimodal image generation task that aims to synthesize high-fidelity flat-lay garments under complex geometric deformation and rich high-frequency textures. Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.

Conclusion: PhysSFI-Net enables interpretable, high-resolution prediction of postoperative facial morphology with superior accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application in orthognathic surgical planning and simulation.

Abstract: Orthognathic surgery repositions jaw bones to restore occlusion and enhance facial aesthetics. Accurate simulation of postoperative facial morphology is essential for preoperative planning. However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm. Comparative experiments indicated that PhysSFI-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method ACMT-Net in prediction accuracy. In conclusion, PhysSFI-Net enables interpretable, high-resolution prediction of postoperative facial morphology with superior accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application in orthognathic surgical planning and simulation.

Abstract: Glacial segmentation is essential for reconstructing past glacier dynamics and evaluating climate-driven landscape change. However, weak optical contrast and the limited availability of high-resolution DEMs hinder automated mapping. This study introduces the first large-scale optical-only moraine segmentation dataset, comprising 3,340 manually annotated high-resolution images from Google Earth covering glaciated regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, China. We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder. Benchmarking against deeper backbones (ResNet152, Xception) shows that MCD-Net achieves 62.3\% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 72.8\% Dice coefficient while reducing computational cost by more than 60\%. Although ridge delineation remains constrained by sub-pixel width and spectral ambiguity, the results demonstrate that optical imagery alone can provide reliable moraine-body segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints/low-texture regions, neural rendering lacks real-time efficiency, and existing 3DGS variants focus on visual quality over geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction for spatial perception tasks.

Method: Feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images with Depth-Normal geometric regularization that couples rendered depth gradients with normal information to supervise Gaussian rotation, scale, and position for improved geometric consistency.

Result: Maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing better point cloud and surface accuracy for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective solution for geometrically consistent 3D reconstruction from 360 images, balancing rendering quality with geometric accuracy for spatial intelligence applications.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction is fundamental for spatial intelligence applications such as AR, robotics, and digital twins. Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints or low-texture regions, while neural rendering approaches, though capable of producing high-quality results, require per-scene optimization and lack real-time efficiency. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient rendering, but most feed-forward variants focus on visual quality rather than geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction and overall reliability in spatial perception tasks. This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-aware head generative models based on 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance, preventing controllable relighting. Current disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions that limit their capacity for complex illumination.

Method: Introduces HeadLighter with a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. Uses progressive disentanglement training to inject head appearance priors, supervised by multi-view images from a light stage setup. Includes a distillation strategy for high-quality normal generation.

Result: The method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering while supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. Experiments demonstrate successful disentanglement of illumination from appearance.

Conclusion: HeadLighter addresses the fundamental limitation of illumination-appearance entanglement in head generative models, enabling controllable relighting through a physically plausible decomposition approach. The framework will be publicly released with code and dataset.

Abstract: Recent 3D-aware head generative models based on 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve real-time, photorealistic and view-consistent head synthesis. However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. We will publicly release our code and dataset.

Conclusion: The work pioneers personalized martial arts combat video generation, addressing a significant gap in two-person interaction modeling and providing resources (dataset and model) for future research in interactive video generation.

Abstract: Amid the surge in generic text-to-video generation, the field of personalized human video generation has witnessed notable advancements, primarily concentrated on single-person scenarios. However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.

However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.

*Chenyang Lai,Shuaiyu Chen,Tianjin Huang,Siyang Song,Guangliang Cheng,Chunbo Luo,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces OSCD (Oil Spill Change Detection) - a bi-temporal approach using pre- and post-spill SAR images to improve oil spill detection accuracy and reduce false positives compared to single-image segmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based segmentation methods on single SAR images struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (biogenic slicks, low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions.

Method: Proposes OSCD task and Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework with two components: 1) High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and 2) Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Uses TAHI to generate synthetic pre-spill images when real co-registered pre-spill imagery is unavailable.

Result: Constructed the first OSCD dataset and benchmarked state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation methods.

Conclusion: Temporally-aware methods (OSCD) provide more reliable and scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios by leveraging change detection between pre- and post-spill images, overcoming limitations of static single-image approaches.

Abstract: Marine oil spills are urgent environmental hazards that demand rapid and reliable detection to minimise ecological and economic damage. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain partitioning strategy enables training of end-to-end reconstruction models for large-scale 3D imaging problems on single GPU by incorporating forward operators through operator approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for imaging inverse problems struggle with large-scale 3D imaging due to memory constraints of global forward operators, preventing incorporation of imaging operators in network architectures for optimal performance.

Method: Proposes domain partitioning strategy and normal operator approximations that allow training of end-to-end reconstruction models with forward operators of arbitrarily large problems, enabling single GPU training and inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D X-ray cone-beam tomography and 3D multi-coil accelerated MRI while requiring only a single GPU for both training and inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully overcomes memory limitations of large-scale 3D imaging problems, enabling incorporation of forward operators in network architectures for improved reconstruction performance with practical computational requirements.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have revolutionized the field of imaging inverse problems, yielding state-of-the-art performance across various imaging domains. The best performing networks incorporate the imaging operator within the network architecture, typically in the form of deep unrolling. However, in large-scale problems, such as 3D imaging, most existing methods fail to incorporate the operator in the architecture due to the prohibitive amount of memory required by global forward operators, which hinder typical patching strategies. In this work, we present a domain partitioning strategy and normal operator approximations that enable the training of end-to-end reconstruction models incorporating forward operators of arbitrarily large problems into their architecture. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D X-ray cone-beam tomography and 3D multi-coil accelerated MRI, while requiring only a single GPU for both training and inference.

### [152] [Why Commodity WiFi Sensors Fail at Multi-Person Gait Identification: A Systematic Analysis Using ESP32](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02177)
*Oliver Custance,Saad Khan,Simon Parkinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors cannot reliably separate multiple people's gait signals despite various signal separation methods, achieving only 45-56% accuracy due to hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While WiFi CSI works well for single-person gait identification, multi-person identification remains unexplored with commodity hardware. The paper aims to determine whether poor multi-person performance is an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint.

Method: Systematically evaluated six signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors. Used novel diagnostic metrics: intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, and performance degradation rate.

Result: All methods achieved similarly low accuracy (45-56%, σ=3.74%) with statistically insignificant differences (p > 0.05). NMF performed best at only 56% accuracy. Analysis revealed high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increased.

Conclusion: Commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation, indicating the limitation is fundamentally hardware-based rather than algorithmic.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has shown promise for single-person gait identification, with numerous studies reporting high accuracy. However, multi-person identification remains largely unexplored, with the limited existing work relying on complex, expensive setups requiring modified firmware. A critical question remains unanswered: is poor multi-person performance an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint? We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\%, $σ$=3.74\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increases, indicating that commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation.

### [153] [QuIC: A Quantum-Inspired Interaction Classifier for Revitalizing Shallow CNNs in Fine-Grained Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02189)
*Cheng Ying Wu,Yen Jui Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuIC (Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier) is a lightweight plug-and-play module that revitalizes shallow networks for fine-grained visual classification by modeling feature channels as quantum states and capturing second-order feature interactions, achieving significant accuracy improvements without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for fine-grained visual classification are too computationally expensive for edge devices, while shallow networks are efficient but lack the ability to capture subtle feature interactions needed to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. Existing solutions like Bilinear CNNs suffer from high dimensionality and training instability.

Method: Proposes QuIC, a quantum-inspired interaction classifier that models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance through a learnable observable operator. It's designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions.

Result: QuIC significantly boosts shallow backbone performance: increases VGG16 Top-1 accuracy by nearly 20%, outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis shows QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.

Conclusion: QuIC effectively bridges the gap between computational efficiency and fine-grained classification accuracy by leveraging quantum-inspired modeling of feature interactions, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining high performance on fine-grained visual classification tasks.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge. While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.

### [154] [Mind the Gap: Continuous Magnification Sampling for Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02198)
*Alexander Möllers,Julius Hense,Florian Schulz,Timo Milbich,Maximilian Alber,Lukas Ruff*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Continuous magnification sampling outperforms discrete sampling in pathology foundation models, improving performance at intermediate magnifications by up to 4% balanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists examine tissue at multiple magnifications, but current pathology foundation models have poor understanding of magnification effects and sampling strategies during training.

Method: Model magnification sampling as multi-source domain adaptation, develop theoretical framework, introduce continuous magnification sampling, derive optimized sampling distributions, and create new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) for evaluation.

Result: Continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications (up to 4% balanced accuracy gain), optimized distributions further improve performance, and magnification is identified as primary driver of performance variation across models.

Conclusion: Continuous magnification sampling and optimized distributions enable more reliable pathology foundation models across all magnifications, paving the way for better multi-scale analysis.

Abstract: In histopathology, pathologists examine both tissue architecture at low magnification and fine-grained morphology at high magnification. Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models. Our work paves the way towards future pathology foundation models that perform reliably across magnifications.

*Oliver Custance,Saad Khan,Simon Parkinson,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage WiFi CSI framework for device-free crowd counting that addresses domain shift through self-supervised contrastive pre-training and lightweight adapter fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Device-free crowd counting using WiFi CSI enables privacy-preserving IoT applications, but practical deployment is hindered by the domain shift problem where models trained in one environment fail to generalize to others.

Method: Two-stage framework with CSI-ResNet-A architecture: 1) Self-supervised contrastive pre-training to learn domain-invariant representations, 2) Lightweight Adapter modules for efficient fine-tuning, followed by stateful counting machine for stable occupancy estimates.

Result: Achieves MAE of 0.44 in 10-shot learning on WiFlow dataset (where supervised baselines fail), near-perfect Generalisation Index, 98.8% accuracy on WiAR benchmark, and adapter fine-tuning achieves 98.84% vs 99.67% full fine-tune while training 97.2% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for robust WiFi-based sensing systems ready for real-world IoT deployments, effectively addressing domain shift through domain-invariant representation learning and parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Device-free crowd-counting using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) is a key enabling technology for a new generation of privacy-preserving Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\% vs. 99.67\%) while training 97.2\% fewer parameters. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for developing robust sensing systems ready for real-world IoT deployments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analyzes MMDiT-based diffusion models (like FLUX/Qwen) to understand block functionality, reveals semantic info appears early while details render late, and proposes training-free methods for better text alignment, editing, and acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only analyze specific components like positional encoding and attention layers, but lack comprehensive understanding of how different blocks interact with textual conditions in MMDiT-based diffusion models during synthesis.

Method: Develops systematic pipeline to investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling, and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Based on findings, proposes novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration.

Result: Method outperforms various baselines across text-to-image generation, editing, and inference acceleration. Improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5 without sacrificing synthesis quality.

Conclusion: The analysis advances understanding of MMDiT models and provides valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements in text-to-image generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs of transformer-based diffusion models, particularly with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) driven models like FLUX and Qwen Image, have facilitated thrilling experiences in text-to-image generation and editing. To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.

*Jingjing Wang,Zhuo Xiao,Xinning Yao,Bo Liu,Lijuan Niu,Xiangzhi Bai,Fugen Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior-guided DETR framework for ultrasound nodule detection that incorporates geometric and structural priors to handle irregular shapes, indistinct boundaries, scale variations, and speckle noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ultrasound nodule detection is crucial for early cancer diagnosis but remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and speckle noise that degrades structural visibility.

Method: Proposes a prior-guided DETR framework with three key components: 1) Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, 2) Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) to extract multi-scale structural priors using both spatial and frequency domains, and 3) Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism to propagate prior-modulated features across encoder layers for consistent geometric and structural guidance.

Result: Superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.

Conclusion: The proposed prior-guided DETR framework effectively addresses ultrasound nodule detection challenges by incorporating geometric and structural priors at multiple network stages, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Accurate detection of ultrasound nodules is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid and breast cancers. However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMVP uses flow matching with masking and frequency-gated loss to purify adversarial videos, achieving state-of-the-art robustness and zero-shot detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing diffusion-based purification methods suffer from inefficient sampling and curved trajectories. Direct regression fails to recover faithful content due to subtle perturbations, requiring physical destruction of adversarial structures.

Method: FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with inpainting objective. Includes Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) to suppress high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity. Uses Attack-Aware and Generalist training paradigms for known and unknown threats.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods (DiffPure, DP, TS, FlowPure) on UCF-101 and HMDB-51, achieving robust accuracy exceeding 87% against PGD and 89% against CW attacks. Shows superior robustness against adaptive attacks (DiffHammer) and functions as zero-shot adversarial detector with 98% detection accuracy for PGD and 79% for CW attacks.

Conclusion: FMVP effectively purifies adversarial videos through flow matching with masking and frequency-gated loss, demonstrating strong robustness against various attacks and serving as an effective zero-shot detector for adversarial content.

Abstract: Video recognition models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing diffusion-based purification methods suffer from inefficient sampling and curved trajectories. Directly regressing clean videos from adversarial inputs often fails to recover faithful content due to the subtle nature of perturbations; this necessitates physically shattering the adversarial structure. Therefore, we propose Flow Matching for Adversarial Video Purification FMVP. FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity. We design Attack-Aware and Generalist training paradigms to handle known and unknown threats, respectively. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 demonstrate that FMVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods (DiffPure, Defense Patterns (DP), Temporal Shuffling (TS) and FlowPure), achieving robust accuracy exceeding 87% against PGD and 89% against CW attacks. Furthermore, FMVP demonstrates superior robustness against adaptive attacks (DiffHammer) and functions as a zero-shot adversarial detector, attaining detection accuracies of 98% for PGD and 79% for highly imperceptible CW attacks.

TL;DR: SLGNet: Parameter-efficient multimodal object detection using hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation in frozen ViT backbones for robust all-weather perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adapter-based approaches for RGB-IR object detection prioritize efficiency over cross-modal structural consistency, losing critical cues in challenging conditions (high-contrast, nighttime). Static fusion mechanisms lack environmental awareness, limiting adaptation to dynamic scene variations.

Method: Proposes SLGNet with: 1) Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into frozen ViT, 2) Language-Guided Modulation module using VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features for environmental awareness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets. On LLVIP benchmark: mAP of 66.1 with ~87% fewer trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SLGNet provides a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception by synergizing structural priors and language guidance within frozen foundation models, enabling superior performance with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception.

TL;DR: Enhanced GRPO framework with conflict management for VAR models improves visual generation quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from asynchronous policy conflicts due to heterogeneous input structures across generation steps, causing unstable training and suboptimal alignment in RL scenarios.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) stabilizing intermediate reward for early-stage guidance, 2) dynamic time-step reweighting for precise credit assignment, and 3) novel mask propagation algorithm from ReFL principles for spatial-temporal optimization isolation.

Result: Significant improvements in sample quality and objective alignment over vanilla GRPO baseline, enabling robust VAR optimization.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively resolves asynchronous policy conflicts in VAR models, making RL-based visual generation more stable and effective.

Abstract: Visual generation is dominated by three paradigms: AutoRegressive (AR), diffusion, and Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models. Unlike AR and diffusion, VARs operate on heterogeneous input structures across their generation steps, which creates severe asynchronous policy conflicts. This issue becomes particularly acute in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, leading to unstable training and suboptimal alignment. To resolve this, we propose a novel framework to enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by explicitly managing these conflicts. Our method integrates three synergistic components: 1) a stabilizing intermediate reward to guide early-stage generation; 2) a dynamic time-step reweighting scheme for precise credit assignment; and 3) a novel mask propagation algorithm, derived from principles of Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL), designed to isolate optimization effects both spatially and temporally. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in sample quality and objective alignment over the vanilla GRPO baseline, enabling robust and effective optimization for VAR models.

Conclusion: DiffProxy effectively bridges synthetic training and real-world generalization by leveraging diffusion-based generative priors, enabling precise mesh recovery from synthetic data that generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human mesh recovery from multi-view images faces a fundamental challenge: real-world datasets contain imperfect ground-truth annotations that bias the models' training, while synthetic data with precise supervision suffers from domain gap. In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

Motivation: Existing 3D visual geometry understanding systems face irreconcilable demands between scalability and long-term stability - offline models can't handle live streaming, while streaming architectures fail with infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences.

Method: Introduces InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer with rolling memory through bounded yet adaptive KV cache, plus training-free attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information with each new frame.

Result: Enables infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability, with code publicly available. Also introduces Long3D benchmark (10,000+ frames) for rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation.

Conclusion: Shatters the scalability-stability dilemma for 3D geometry understanding, providing both infinite-horizon streaming capability and superior long-term stability, with a new benchmark enabling proper evaluation of future research.

Abstract: The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT

*Tom Burgert,Leonard Hackel,Paolo Rota,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoRank introduces a novel regularization method for contrastive self-supervised learning that optimizes spherical distances to embed geographical relationships into feature representations for multispectral remote sensing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning has proven effective for computer vision but faces unique challenges when applied to multispectral remote sensing images due to geographical and temporal variability. Existing methods don't adequately capture geographical relationships in the learned feature space.

Method: GeoRank is a regularization method for contrastive SSL that directly optimizes spherical distances to embed geographical relationships. The paper also systematically investigates key adaptations for multispectral RS images including data augmentations, dataset cardinality, image size impact, and temporal view task dependency.

Result: GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms like BYOL and DINO. The systematic investigation provides insights into effective adaptations for multispectral RS images.

Conclusion: GeoRank effectively embeds geographical relationships into SSL feature representations for remote sensing, and the systematic analysis provides guidance for adapting contrastive SSL to multispectral RS images. The code is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for learning from large, unlabeled datasets, particularly in computer vision (CV). However, applying SSL to multispectral remote sensing (RS) images presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the geographical and temporal variability of the data. In this paper, we introduce GeoRank, a novel regularization method for contrastive SSL that improves upon prior techniques by directly optimizing spherical distances to embed geographical relationships into the learned feature space. GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

*Sara Inácio,Hugo Proença,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SortWaste dataset addresses lack of real-world waste sorting data; ClutterScore metric quantifies scene complexity; benchmark shows current models struggle with cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual waste sorting is inefficient and hazardous, while automated systems struggle with real-world waste variability and clutter. Lack of real-world datasets hinders development of effective automated waste sorting solutions.

Method: Introduces SortWaste dataset from Material Recovery Facility with dense annotations. Proposes ClutterScore metric using proxies like object count, class/size entropy, and spatial overlap to quantify scene complexity. Benchmarks state-of-the-art object detection models.

Result: Achieved 59.7% mAP for plastic-only detection, but performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. ClutterScore effectively correlates with detection difficulty.

Conclusion: Current object detection models struggle with cluttered waste scenes despite promising baseline results. Need for more challenging datasets and improved models to handle real-world waste sorting complexity.

Abstract: The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 360DVO is the first deep learning-based monocular omnidirectional visual odometry system that uses a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor and omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment for robust pose estimation in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing omnidirectional visual odometry systems rely on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, which lack robustness in challenging scenarios like aggressive motion and varying illumination. There's a need for more robust deep learning-based approaches for 360-degree camera systems.

Method: Introduces 360DVO with two key components: 1) Distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images, and 2) Omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module that uses sparse feature patches to establish constraints for effective pose estimation.

Result: 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM) on real-world benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

Conclusion: 360DVO represents a significant advancement in omnidirectional visual odometry by introducing the first deep learning-based framework that effectively handles distortion in 360-degree images and demonstrates superior performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular omnidirectional visual odometry (OVO) systems leverage 360-degree cameras to overcome field-of-view limitations of perspective VO systems. However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Beth Tellman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prithvi-CAFE combines Prithvi GFM with CNN residual branch and attention modules to improve flood mapping by capturing local details while maintaining global context, achieving SOTA results on Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geo-Foundation Models (GFMs) struggle with flood mapping tasks, particularly in capturing critical local nuances needed for accurate segmentation, as shown by their inability to outperform baseline U-Net on Sen1Flood11 dataset.

Method: Prithvi-CAFE integrates Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM), enabling fast fine-tuning via adapters and multi-scale, multi-level feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: IoU 83.41 on Sen1Flood11 test (vs Prithvi 82.50, U-Net baseline), IoU 81.37 on hold-out site (vs U-Net 70.57, Prithvi 72.42), and IoU 64.70 on FloodPlanet (vs U-Net 60.14, other GFMs).

Conclusion: Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for segmentation tasks requiring multi-channel/multi-modal data where local details are critical, offering a simple yet effective approach that outperforms both baseline models and other GFMs.

Abstract: Geo-Foundation Models (GFMs), have proven effective in diverse downstream applications, including semantic segmentation, classification, and regression tasks. However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

*Roja Sahoo,Anoop Namboodiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fusion2Print (F2P) fuses paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints to enhance ridge clarity and achieve superior recognition performance over single-capture baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contactless fingerprint recognition offers hygienic advantages but suffers from degraded ridge clarity due to illumination issues, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, while non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast.

Method: Proposes Fusion2Print (F2P) framework that systematically captures and fuses paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. Creates custom FNF Database with manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. Uses lightweight attention-based fusion network to integrate modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, followed by U-Net enhancement module to produce optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally employs deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility for unified embedding space.

Result: F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance with AUC=0.999 and EER=1.12%, outperforming single-capture baselines like Verifinger and DeepPrint.

Conclusion: The Fusion2Print framework successfully addresses contactless fingerprint recognition challenges by fusing flash and non-flash modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining compatibility with both contactless and contact-based fingerprint systems.

Abstract: Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification. F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance (AUC=0.999, EER=1.12%) over single-capture baselines (Verifinger, DeepPrint).

*Laurent Caraffa*

TL;DR: BEDS unifies thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, and machine learning, proposing that learning is flux-to-structure conversion via entropy export, with practical applications in energy-efficient distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified theoretical framework connecting non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning, bridging fundamental physics with practical system design for sustainable AI.

Method: Establishes formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, derives mathematical constants as Bayesian inference fixed points, links Gödel's theorems to thermodynamic constraints, and implements peer-to-peer network architecture based on BEDS principles.

Result: Derived fundamental constants (e, π, φ) as Bayesian inference fixed points, proposed Gödel-thermodynamics conjecture, and achieved six orders of magnitude energy efficiency improvement in distributed consensus systems through practical implementation.

Conclusion: BEDS provides a comprehensive framework showing that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns, offering both theoretical insights into learning/computation and practical pathways toward energy-efficient AI systems.

Abstract: We present BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures), a theoretical framework that unifies concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning. The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.
  We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking Gödel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.
  As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence.

### [169] [Joint Semantic and Rendering Enhancements in 3D Gaussian Modeling with Anisotropic Local Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02339)
*Jingming He,Chongyi Li,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes semantic and rendering branches using anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptors and adaptive resource allocation based on semantic/shape signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS semantic segmentation methods treat semantic and rendering branches separately, rely solely on 2D supervision ignoring 3D geometry, and use rendering gradients for adaptation which fails in textureless regions.

Method: 1) Anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using Laplace-Beltrami operator for fine-grained shape details; 2) Adaptive Gaussian allocation using semantic/shape signals instead of just rendering gradients; 3) Cross-scene knowledge transfer module for continuous shape pattern updates.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates.

Conclusion: The proposed joint enhancement framework successfully integrates semantic and rendering branches, captures 3D shape details, enables efficient resource allocation, and facilitates knowledge transfer across scenes for better semantic segmentation and rendering.

Abstract: Recent works propose extending 3DGS with semantic feature vectors for simultaneous semantic segmentation and image rendering. However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combines neural network pruning with few-shot learning to create lightweight plant disease detection models that run efficiently on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time diagnosis for farmers in remote areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers in remote areas need accessible plant disease diagnosis but lack lab resources and high-performance computing. Existing deep learning models are too large for low-cost edge devices, and collecting extensive labeled training data is expensive and time-consuming.

Method: Proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS) integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. DACIS identifies important neural network parts for disease distinction, combining pruning (removing unnecessary model components) with few-shot learning (learning from limited examples).

Result: Achieves 78% model size reduction while maintaining 92.3% of original accuracy. The compressed model runs at 7 frames per second on Raspberry Pi 4, enabling real-time field diagnosis. Validated on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach makes real-time plant disease diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers by creating lightweight, efficient models that balance accuracy with computational constraints, addressing both model size and data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Farmers in remote areas need quick and reliable methods for identifying plant diseases, yet they often lack access to laboratories or high-performance computing resources. Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\% while maintaining 92.3\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers.

*Jing Tan,Zhaoyang Zhang,Yantao Shen,Jiarui Cai,Shuo Yang,Jiajun Wu,Wei Xia,Zhuowen Tu,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Move is an RL-based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects in scenes, enabling precise geometric manipulations like translation, rotation, and resizing without paired supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based manipulation methods struggle with object-level geometric transformations due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits, creating a need for systems that can perform spatial manipulations through natural language.

Method: Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts from input images and textual variations, with spatial reward guidance, off-policy step evaluation, and active step sampling for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing text-guided editing approaches in spatial accuracy and scene coherence on curated benchmarks, achieving precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations.

Conclusion: Talk2Move demonstrates that RL-based diffusion with spatial rewards can effectively perform text-instructed geometric transformations without costly paired data, advancing scene manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Talk2Move, a reinforcement learning (RL) based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects within scenes. Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.

*Junyi Chen,Tong He,Zhoujie Fu,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Weicai Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VINO is a unified visual generator that performs both image and video generation/editing using a single shared diffusion backbone with multimodal conditioning, avoiding task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on task-specific models or independent modules for different visual modalities (images vs videos), leading to fragmented systems. The authors aim to create a unified framework that can handle both image and video generation/editing tasks within a single model.

Method: VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT). Multimodal inputs (text, images, videos) are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens that guide the diffusion process. The system uses a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified multi-task generator.

Result: VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits across diverse generation and editing benchmarks. It supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation and highlights the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation, showing that a single model can effectively handle both image and video tasks.

Abstract: We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.

TL;DR: ExposeAnyone: A self-supervised diffusion-based method for detecting unknown deepfake manipulations by personalizing to specific subjects and measuring identity distances via diffusion reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen manipulations due to overfitting to specific forgery patterns from supervised training. Self-supervised methods have potential but struggle to learn discriminative representations.

Method: Fully self-supervised approach using diffusion models to generate expression sequences from audio. Personalizes models to specific subjects using reference sets, then computes identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors.

Result: Outperforms previous SOTA by 4.22 percentage points in average AUC across DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets. Capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos where previous approaches fail. Highly robust to corruptions like blur and compression.

Conclusion: ExposeAnyone demonstrates superior generalization to unseen manipulations through self-supervised learning, showing strong performance on both existing datasets and emerging threats like Sora2, with practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.

TL;DR: V-VLAPS enhances Vision-Language-Action models with a lightweight value function to guide Monte Carlo Tree Search, improving success rates while reducing computational cost in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely on behavior cloning and are brittle under distribution shift. While MCTS can help, existing approaches use only the VLA prior for guidance, lacking grounded estimates of future returns, which makes them inefficient when the prior is inaccurate.

Method: V-VLAPS augments MCTS with a learnable value function - a simple MLP trained on latent representations from a fixed VLA backbone (Octo). This provides an explicit success signal to bias action selection toward high-value regions during search.

Result: On the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, V-VLAPS improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing average MCTS simulations by 5-15% compared to baselines using only the VLA prior.

Conclusion: Adding a lightweight value function to VLA-based planning significantly improves both performance and efficiency, addressing limitations of prior-only search methods in robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic manipulation, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on behavior cloning, leading to brittleness under distribution shift. While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) Perception-to-Symbolic State (PSS) using vision-language models to align RGB-D observations with design specs, 2) Human-Aware Planning and Replanning (HPR) with minimal-change replanning for task assignment updates

Result: PSS achieves 97% state synthesis accuracy; HPR maintains feasible task progression across diverse HRC scenarios; validated on 27-component timber-frame assembly

Conclusion: Integrating VLM-based perception with knowledge-driven planning improves robustness of state estimation and task planning under dynamic conditions in human-robot collaboration

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in structured assembly requires reliable state estimation and adaptive task planning under noisy perception and human interventions. To address these challenges, we introduce a design-grounded human-aware planning framework for human-robot collaborative structured assembly. The framework comprises two coupled modules. Module I, Perception-to-Symbolic State (PSS), employs vision-language models (VLMs) based agents to align RGB-D observations with design specifications and domain knowledge, synthesizing verifiable symbolic assembly states. It outputs validated installed and uninstalled component sets for online state tracking. Module II, Human-Aware Planning and Replanning (HPR), performs task-level multi-robot assignment and updates the plan only when the observed state deviates from the expected execution outcome. It applies a minimal-change replanning rule to selectively revise task assignments and preserve plan stability even under human interventions. We validate the framework on a 27-component timber-frame assembly. The PSS module achieves 97% state synthesis accuracy, and the HPR module maintains feasible task progression across diverse HRC scenarios. Results indicate that integrating VLM-based perception with knowledge-driven planning improves robustness of state estimation and task planning under dynamic conditions.

*Wenhui Chu,Khang Tran,Nikolaos V. Tsekos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A computational platform for MRI-powered robotic applicator planning and modeling in blood vessels using virtual fixtures and magnetic field gradient waveforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is used for pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance, with MRI-powered ferromagnetic applicators needing safe navigation through vascular networks without vessel perforation.

Method: Two-way pipeline linking MRI scanner, computational core, and operator; processes MR data to extract vascular bed, creates virtual fixture corridors, generates magnetic field gradient waveforms based on vessel geometry and safety constraints, and models applicator maneuvering with blood flow considerations.

Result: Implemented Qt-based platform with threaded modules for PID control, virtual fixture generation, and MR gradient waveform generation, capable of assessing safe maneuverability of vascular paths.

Conclusion: The platform enables safe preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators in blood vessels, with real-time operation capabilities for future experimental studies.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms.

Motivation: Need for lightweight, efficient navigation systems that don't require precise metric maps or pre-training, suitable for robots and humans in various environments.

Method: Converts keyframes to descriptors using AnyLoc, builds topological maps with key nodes, performs navigation by comparing segmented images with target node images.

Result: Effective loop detection and navigation in real/simulation environments, 60.2% average success rate improvement over ResNet-based methods with reduced time/space costs.

Conclusion: Monocular camera-based topological mapping provides lightweight, efficient navigation solution without pre-training, suitable for diverse robotic and human applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for topological mapping and navigation using a monocular camera. Based on AnyLoc, keyframes are converted into descriptors to construct topological relationships, enabling loop detection and map building. Unlike metric maps, topological maps simplify path planning and navigation by representing environments with key nodes instead of precise coordinates. Actions for visual navigation are determined by comparing segmented images with the image associated with target nodes. The system relies solely on a monocular camera, ensuring fast map building and navigation using key nodes. Experiments show effective loop detection and navigation in real and simulation environments without pre-training. Compared to a ResNet-based method, this approach improves success rates by 60.2% on average while reducing time and space costs, offering a lightweight solution for robot and human navigation in various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field experimentation in hadal zones is extremely challenging due to extreme pressure, limited visibility, currents, high costs, risks, and limited vehicle availability, making early validation of autonomous behaviors difficult.

Method: Used Stonefish simulator to model realistic vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamic disturbances, sensing, and object interaction under hadal conditions. Control framework combines world-frame PID controller for navigation with inverse-kinematics-based manipulator controller with acceleration feed-forward for coordinated operation.

Result: HSV autonomously descended from sea surface to 6,000m, performed structured seafloor coverage, detected target object, and executed suction-based recovery in simulation.

Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation provides effective and low-risk means of evaluating autonomous deep-sea intervention behaviors before field deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous object recovery in the hadal zone is challenging due to extreme hydrostatic pressure, limited visibility and currents, and the need for precise manipulation at full ocean depth. Field experimentation in such environments is costly, high-risk, and constrained by limited vehicle availability, making early validation of autonomous behaviors difficult. This paper presents a simulation-based study of a complete autonomous subsea object recovery mission using a Hadal Small Vehicle (HSV) equipped with a three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a suction-actuated end effector. The Stonefish simulator is used to model realistic vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamic disturbances, sensing, and interaction with a target object under hadal-like conditions. The control framework combines a world-frame PID controller for vehicle navigation and stabilization with an inverse-kinematics-based manipulator controller augmented by acceleration feed-forward, enabling coordinated vehicle - manipulator operation. In simulation, the HSV autonomously descends from the sea surface to 6,000 m, performs structured seafloor coverage, detects a target object, and executes a suction-based recovery. The results demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation provides an effective and low-risk means of evaluating autonomous deep-sea intervention behaviors prior to field deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent mapping approaches face scalability limitations in motion planning, and reinforcement learning methods are constrained by limited input sizes, restricting them to discrete environments.

Method: Uses autoencoders to compress high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent vectors, procedural generation with Perlin noise for complex training environments, hierarchical deep reinforcement learning for decentralized coordination, and weighted consensus with tuneable trust parameters.

Result: System scales effectively with number of agents, generalizes to unfamiliar environments, and remains resilient in communication-constrained settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully overcomes scalability limitations in multi-agent mapping by combining dimensionality reduction, procedural environment generation, and robust decentralized coordination mechanisms.

Abstract: Autonomous mapping of unknown environments is a critical challenge, particularly in scenarios where time is limited. Multi-agent systems can enhance efficiency through collaboration, but the scalability of motion-planning algorithms remains a key limitation. Reinforcement learning has been explored as a solution, but existing approaches are constrained by the limited input size required for effective learning, restricting their applicability to discrete environments. This work addresses that limitation by leveraging autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction, compressing high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent state vectors while preserving essential spatial information. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedural generation algorithm based on Perlin noise, designed to generate topologically complex training environments that simulate asteroid fields, caves and forests. These environments are used for training the autoencoder and the navigation algorithm using a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for decentralized coordination. We introduce a weighted consensus mechanism that modulates reliance on shared data via a tuneable trust parameter, ensuring robustness to accumulation of errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scales effectively with number of agents and generalizes well to unfamiliar, structurally distinct environments and is resilient in communication-constrained settings.

TL;DR: ORION: A deep RL framework for cooperative multi-agent navigation in partially known environments using option-critic learning and dual-stage cooperation to balance individual path planning with team exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent navigation methods assume fully known environments, but real-world scenarios like warehouses often have partial knowledge. Agents need to balance their own path optimality with collecting/sharing environmental information to help teammates.

Method: ORION uses deep RL with a shared graph encoder that fuses prior maps with online perception. It employs an option-critic framework to learn high-level cooperative modes that translate to low-level actions, allowing adaptive switching between individual navigation and team exploration. A dual-stage cooperation strategy helps agents assist teammates under map uncertainty.

Result: ORION achieves high-quality, real-time decentralized cooperation across varying team sizes in maze-like maps and large-scale warehouse environments, outperforming state-of-the-art classical and learning-based baselines. Physical robot validation demonstrates robustness and practicality.

Conclusion: ORION successfully addresses cooperative multi-agent navigation in partially known environments through adaptive option-critic learning and dual-stage cooperation, enabling effective balance between individual goals and team information gathering.

Abstract: Existing methods for multi-agent navigation typically assume fully known environments, offering limited support for partially known scenarios such as warehouses or factory floors. There, agents may need to plan trajectories that balance their own path optimality with their ability to collect and share information about the environment that can help their teammates reach their own goals. To these ends, we propose ORION, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative multi-agent online navigation in partially known environments. Starting from an imperfect prior map, ORION trains agents to make decentralized decisions, coordinate to reach their individual targets, and actively reduce map uncertainty by sharing online observations in a closed perception-action loop. We first design a shared graph encoder that fuses prior map with online perception into a unified representation, providing robust state embeddings under dynamic map discrepancies. At the core of ORION is an option-critic framework that learns to reason about a set of high-level cooperative modes that translate into sequences of low-level actions, allowing agents to switch between individual navigation and team-level exploration adaptively. We further introduce a dual-stage cooperation strategy that enables agents to assist teammates under map uncertainty, thereby reducing the overall makespan. Across extensive maze-like maps and large-scale warehouse environments, our simulation results show that ORION achieves high-quality, real-time decentralized cooperation over varying team sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art classical and learning-based baselines. Finally, we validate ORION on physical robot teams, demonstrating its robustness and practicality for real-world cooperative navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods rely on handcrafted calibration targets or specific static scenes, limiting adaptability for real-world robotic applications. There's also a generalization degradation problem in prior methods.

Method: Proposes double-sided data augmentation generating multi-perspective camera views using estimated depth maps. Designs dual-path self-supervised calibration framework with difference map construction to explicitly correlate LiDAR and camera features instead of traditional dual-branch extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets plus own recorded dataset show the method significantly outperforms existing approaches in generalizability.

Conclusion: First self-supervised LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration network enabling online operation without calibration targets, with improved generalization through novel augmentation and feature correlation techniques.

Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-modal data fusion in robotic perception systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on handcrafted calibration targets (e.g., checkerboards) or specific, static scene types, limiting their adaptability and deployment in real-world autonomous and robotic applications. This article presents the first self-supervised LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration network that operates in an online fashion and eliminates the need for specific calibration targets. We first identify a significant generalization degradation problem in prior methods, caused by the conventional single-sided data augmentation strategy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel double-sided data augmentation technique that generates multi-perspective camera views using estimated depth maps, thereby enhancing robustness and diversity during training. Built upon this augmentation strategy, we design a dual-path, self-supervised calibration framework that reduces the dependence on high-precision ground truth labels and supports fully adaptive online calibration. Furthermore, to improve cross-modal feature association, we replace the traditional dual-branch feature extraction design with a difference map construction process that explicitly correlates LiDAR and camera features. This not only enhances calibration accuracy but also reduces model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on five public benchmark datasets, as well as our own recorded dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Service robots need to manipulate arbitrary articulated objects (like drawers) for household tasks, requiring estimation of articulation properties without prior manipulation experience.

Method: Uses factor graph to fuse learned visual priors (from deep learning) and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into analytical Screw Theory model for online articulation estimation.

Result: 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects in real hardware experiments; demonstrated closed-loop estimation and manipulation of unseen drawers.

Conclusion: Combining visual priors with proprioceptive sensing in factor graph enables effective online articulation estimation for robotic manipulation of previously unseen articulated objects.

Abstract: From refrigerators to kitchen drawers, humans interact with articulated objects effortlessly every day while completing household chores. For automating these tasks, service robots must be capable of manipulating arbitrary articulated objects. Recent deep learning methods have been shown to predict valuable priors on the affordance of articulated objects from vision. In contrast, many other works estimate object articulations by observing the articulation motion, but this requires the robot to already be capable of manipulating the object. In this article, we propose a novel approach combining these methods by using a factor graph for online estimation of articulation which fuses learned visual priors and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into an analytical model of articulation based on Screw Theory. With our method, a robotic system makes an initial prediction of articulation from vision before touching the object, and then quickly updates the estimate from kinematic and force sensing during manipulation. We evaluate our method extensively in both simulations and real-world robotic manipulation experiments. We demonstrate several closed-loop estimation and manipulation experiments in which the robot was capable of opening previously unseen drawers. In real hardware experiments, the robot achieved a 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA policies rely on text-only cues with latent plan intent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered scenes, impedes effective task decomposition, and limits causal explanation of action choices.

Method: Introduces Visual Sketch (points, boxes, arrows, typed relations) to externalize spatial intent, then Action-Sketcher framework with See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow using adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans in both simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Visual sketches as intermediate representations effectively address limitations of text-only VLA policies, enabling better spatial grounding, reactive corrections, and human interaction while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation is increasingly important for real-world deployment, requiring spatial disambiguation in complex layouts and temporal resilience under dynamic interaction. However, existing end-to-end and hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies often rely on text-only cues while keeping plan intent latent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered or underspecified scenes, impedes effective task decomposition of long-horizon goals with close-loop interaction, and limits causal explanation by obscuring the rationale behind action choices. To address these issues, we first introduce Visual Sketch, an implausible visual intermediate that renders points, boxes, arrows, and typed relations in the robot's current views to externalize spatial intent, connect language to scene geometry. Building on Visual Sketch, we present Action-Sketcher, a VLA framework that operates in a cyclic See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow coordinated by adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance, thereby supporting reactive corrections and human interaction while preserving real-time action prediction. To enable scalable training and evaluation, we curate diverse corpus with interleaved images, text, Visual Sketch supervision, and action sequences, and train Action-Sketcher with a multi-stage curriculum recipe that combines interleaved sequence alignment for modality unification, language-to-sketch consistency for precise linguistic grounding, and imitation learning augmented with sketch-to-action reinforcement for robustness. Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes and multi-object tasks, in simulation and on real-world tasks, show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans.

Conclusion: DemoBot offers a scalable framework for direct skill acquisition from unannotated human videos, eliminating the need for learning from scratch or manual annotation.

Abstract: This work presents DemoBot, a learning framework that enables a dual-arm, multi-finger robotic system to acquire complex manipulation skills from a single unannotated RGB-D video demonstration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using tactile and vision data improves 6D object pose estimation for in-hand manipulation by addressing occlusion issues through point cloud representation and dense fusion networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-hand 6D object pose estimation is challenging due to heavy occlusion from robot grippers, which affects vision-only methods. Tactile sensors at robot fingertips can complement vision data to overcome this limitation.

Method: Proposes using point clouds to represent object surfaces in contact with tactile sensors and presents a network architecture based on pixel-wise dense fusion. Extends NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dataset Synthesizer to generate synthetic photo-realistic vision data with corresponding tactile point clouds.

Result: Results show that using tactile data in addition to vision data improves 6D pose estimation accuracy. The network successfully generalizes from synthetic training to real physical robots.

Conclusion: Tactile-visual fusion using point cloud representation and dense fusion networks effectively addresses occlusion challenges in in-hand 6D object pose estimation, with successful transfer from synthetic to real-world applications.

Abstract: Knowledge of the 6D pose of an object can benefit in-hand object manipulation. In-hand 6D object pose estimation is challenging because of heavy occlusion produced by the robot's grippers, which can have an adverse effect on methods that rely on vision data only. Many robots are equipped with tactile sensors at their fingertips that could be used to complement vision data. In this paper, we present a method that uses both tactile and vision data to estimate the pose of an object grasped in a robot's hand. To address challenges like lack of standard representation for tactile data and sensor fusion, we propose the use of point clouds to represent object surfaces in contact with the tactile sensor and present a network architecture based on pixel-wise dense fusion. We also extend NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dataset Synthesizer to produce synthetic photo-realistic vision data and corresponding tactile point clouds. Results suggest that using tactile data in addition to vision data improves the 6D pose estimate, and our network generalizes successfully from synthetic training to real physical robots.

### [191] [Explicit World Models for Reliable Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01705)
*Kenneth Kwok,Basura Fernando,Qianli Xu,Vigneshwaran Subbaraju,Dongkyu Choi,Boon Kiat Quek*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper argues for a shift from formal verification methods to a human-centered approach for reliable embodied AI, focusing on building explicit world models to align robot behaviors with human expectations in dynamic social environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to reliable embodied AI focus too much on formal verification and model predictability, but fail to address the dynamic, ambiguous, and subjective nature of human-robot interactions in real-world social environments.

Method: Proposes building and continuously updating an "explicit world model" that represents the common ground between humans and AI, which is used to align robot behaviors with human expectations and intentions.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework that redefines reliability as contextually determined and meaningful only in relation to human goals and expectations, rather than as an absolute property of the AI system.

Conclusion: Reliable embodied AI requires a fundamentally different approach centered on human-robot interaction, where robots must perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in ways that are consistent, comprehensible, and aligned with human expectations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of robustness under sensing noise, ambiguous instructions, and human-robot interaction. We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.

### [193] [AlignDrive: Aligned Lateral-Longitudinal Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01762)
*Yanhao Wu,Haoyang Zhang,Fei He,Rui Wu,Congpei Qiu,Liang Gao,Wei Ke,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a cascaded framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that conditions longitudinal planning on lateral drive paths, improving coordination and safety through path-conditioned formulation and planning-oriented data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA end-to-end autonomous driving models use parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions, which can lead to coordination failures between path and speed, and underutilize the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, causing redundant encoding of static information.

Method: Introduces a cascaded framework with path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates drive paths into longitudinal planning. Predicts longitudinal displacements along drive paths rather than full 2D waypoints. Also includes planning-oriented data augmentation that simulates rare safety-critical events like vehicle cut-ins by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets for collision avoidance.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on Bench2Drive benchmark with driving score of 89.07 and success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded framework with path-conditioned longitudinal planning and safety-focused data augmentation enables more coordinated and collision-aware autonomous driving, addressing limitations of parallel planning approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has rapidly progressed, enabling joint perception and planning in complex environments. In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety

### [194] [DisCo-FLoc: Using Dual-Level Visual-Geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate Depth-Aware Visual Floorplan Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01822)
*Shiyong Meng,Tao Zou,Bolei Chen,Chaoxu Mu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DisCo-FLoc uses dual-level visual-geometric contrastive learning to disambiguate floorplan localization without semantic labels, outperforming semantic-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing floorplan localization methods suffer from ambiguous localization due to repetitive structures in minimalist floorplans and are limited by expensive semantic annotations.

Method: Uses ray regression predictor for FLoc candidates, plus novel contrastive learning with position-level and orientation-level constraints to match depth-aware visual features with floorplan geometry.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semantic-based methods on two standard benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DisCo-FLoc effectively eliminates FLoc ambiguity without requiring additional semantic labels, demonstrating superior performance through dual-level visual-geometric contrastive learning.

Abstract: Since floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has garnered significant attention. Existing methods either ingeniously match geometric priors or utilize sparse semantics to reduce FLoc uncertainty. However, they still suffer from ambiguous FLoc caused by repetitive structures within minimalist floorplans. Moreover, expensive but limited semantic annotations restrict their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DisCo-FLoc, which utilizes dual-level visual-geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate depth-aware visual Floc, without requiring additional semantic labels. Our solution begins with a ray regression predictor tailored for ray-casting-based FLoc, predicting a series of FLoc candidates using depth estimation expertise. In addition, a novel contrastive learning method with position-level and orientation-level constraints is proposed to strictly match depth-aware visual features with the corresponding geometric structures in the floorplan. Such matches can effectively eliminate FLoc ambiguity and select the optimal imaging pose from FLoc candidates. Exhaustive comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic-based method, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous language-guided navigation in large-scale outdoor environments is challenging due to difficulties in semantic reasoning, dynamic conditions, and long-term stability.

Method: Constructs multi-level semantic scene graph (Embodied Graph) using LLMs, hierarchically integrating coarse-grained map data with fine-grained object entities. Uses RAG for semantic navigation and long-range planning. Continuously updates graph within temporal window to handle dynamic objects and environmental changes.

Result: Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate superior robustness and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CausalNav is the first scene graph-based semantic navigation framework tailored for dynamic outdoor environments, enabling robust language-guided navigation through hierarchical semantic reasoning and continuous graph updates.

Abstract: Autonomous language-guided navigation in large-scale outdoor environments remains a key challenge in mobile robotics, due to difficulties in semantic reasoning, dynamic conditions, and long-term stability. We propose CausalNav, the first scene graph-based semantic navigation framework tailored for dynamic outdoor environments. We construct a multi-level semantic scene graph using LLMs, referred to as the Embodied Graph, that hierarchically integrates coarse-grained map data with fine-grained object entities. The constructed graph serves as a retrievable knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling semantic navigation and long-range planning under open-vocabulary queries. By fusing real-time perception with offline map data, the Embodied Graph supports robust navigation across varying spatial granularities in dynamic outdoor environments. Dynamic objects are explicitly handled in both the scene graph construction and hierarchical planning modules. The Embodied Graph is continuously updated within a temporal window to reflect environmental changes and support real-time semantic navigation. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate superior robustness and efficiency.

### [196] [From Metrics to Meaning: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Field Experiment on Retail Robot Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01946)
*Sichao Song,Yuki Okafuji,Takuya Iwamoto,Jun Baba,Hiroshi Ishiguro*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A field experiment in a bedding store tested a conversational service robot under three conditions. While the robot increased initial customer stopping (especially with a fixture), it decreased clerk-led downstream steps like store entry and purchases due to staff avoiding interruptions, timing issues, and child-focused attraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how conversational service robots affect customer-staff interactions in real retail settings when deployed under everyday staffing conditions, examining both quantitative outcomes and staff perspectives.

Method: Mixed-methods field experiment over 12 days with three alternating conditions: Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture. Video-annotated service funnel tracking from passersby to purchase, followed by explanatory sequential design using six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret quantitative patterns.

Result: Robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with fixture), but decreased clerk-led downstream steps per stopper (clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, purchase). Staff interviews revealed clerks avoided interrupting robot-customer conversations, struggled with timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that satisfied curiosity at doorway. Fixture amplified visibility but anchored encounters at threshold.

Conclusion: The study provides an integrative account of customer journey from initial interest to store entry, revealing complex dynamics between robots, staff, and customers. Offers practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail by addressing timing coordination, interruption protocols, and spatial design considerations.

Abstract: We report a mixed-methods field experiment of a conversational service robot deployed under everyday staffing discretion in a live bedding store. Over 12 days we alternated three conditions--Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture--and video-annotated the service funnel from passersby to purchase. An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns.
  Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside.
  We synthesize these strands into an integrative account from the initial show of interest on the part of a customer to their entering the store and derive actionable guidance. The results advance the understanding of interactions between customers, staff members, and the robot and offer practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail.

### [197] [Learning Diffusion Policy from Primitive Skills for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01948)
*Zhihao Gu,Ming Yang,Difan Zou,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDP: Skill-conditioned Diffusion Policy that uses primitive skills as interface for robot learning, outperforming SOTA methods in simulation and real-world deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies rely on global instructions for short-term control, causing misalignment in action generation. Primitive skills (fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations) provide more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning.

Method: SDP integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning: abstracts 8 reusable primitive skills, uses vision-language model to extract discrete representations, designs lightweight router network to assign desired primitive skill per state, constructs single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions.

Result: Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods.

Conclusion: SDP provides a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies by decomposing complex tasks into sequence of primitive skills and ensuring skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion policies (DP) have recently shown great promise for generating actions in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies.

*Sichao Song,Yuki Okafuji,Kaito Ariu,Amy Koike*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Online Thompson sampling optimizes social robot speech policies (rate × verbosity) using multi-armed bandits during 12-day public deployment, comparing three binary rewards to adapt to diverse real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need adaptable speech policies for open environments; fixed parameters can't handle non-stationary conditions, requiring online learning for real-world adaptation.

Method: 12-day in-situ deployment with 1,400+ encounters; cast as 6-arm bandit (speech rate × verbosity); used Thompson sampling with three binary rewards (user rating, conversation closure, ≥2 turns); complemented with offline contextual analysis.

Result: Each reward induced distinct arm distributions and interaction behaviors; offline analysis revealed contextual factors (crowd level, group size) influence optimal policies; practical design lessons for real-world HRI deployment.

Conclusion: Online optimization via multi-armed bandits effectively adapts robot speech policies in public settings; different rewards shape distinct behaviors; provides actionable guidelines for deploying adaptive speech policies in real-world HRI.

Abstract: Designing policies that are both efficient and acceptable for conversational service robots in open and diverse environments is non-trivial. Unlike fixed, hand-tuned parameters, online learning can adapt to non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we study how to adapt a social robot's speech policy in the wild. During a 12-day in-situ deployment with over 1,400 public encounters, we cast online policy optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling to select among six actions defined by speech rate (slow/normal/fast) and verbosity (concise/detailed). We compare three complementary binary rewards--Ru (user rating), Rc (conversation closure), and Rt (>=2 turns)--and show that each induces distinct arm distributions and interaction behaviors. We complement the online results with offline evaluations that analyze contextual factors (e.g., crowd level, group size) using video-annotated data. Taken together, we distill ready-to-use design lessons for deploying online optimization of speech policies in real public HRI settings.

*Aditya Singh,Rajpal Singh,Jishnu Keshavan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an autoencoder-based neural architecture to learn reduced-bias Koopman operators from noisy data by jointly learning lifting functions and leveraging forward/backward temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain accurate Koopman operator approximations. Noise-induced bias in Koopman operators severely degrades prediction and tracking performance in nonlinear systems.

Method: Autoencoder-based neural architecture that learns Koopman basis functions consistent for both forward and backward temporal dynamics. Uses learned forward/backward dynamics to synthesize a reduced-bias Koopman operator, making it more robust to noise.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates significant bias reduction with training noise. Simulations with serial manipulator arms show robustness under various noise levels, outperforming alternative designs. Experimental validation with Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator demonstrates practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively reduces noise-induced bias in Koopman operator learning, improving robustness for dynamics prediction and tracking control in practical noisy environments.

Abstract: Koopman operator theory has emerged as a leading data-driven approach that relies on a judicious choice of observable functions to realize global linear representations of nonlinear systems in the lifted observable space. However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting.

*Meili Sun,Chunjiang Zhao,Lichao Yang,Hao Liu,Shimin Hu,Ya Xiong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework for strawberry harvesting robots that integrates multi-task perception (detection, segmentation, ripeness) with corrective control to address misalignment, empty grasping, and fruit slippage issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strawberry harvesting robots face persistent challenges including low visual perception integration, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and fruit slippage due to insufficient gripping force, which compromise harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments.

Method: Proposed SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model for simultaneous strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation. Integrated relative error compensation for positional misalignment, early abort strategy for empty grasping, and real-time visual feedback using micro-optical camera with MobileNet V3-Small and LSTM classifiers for grasp detection and slip prediction.

Result: SRR-Net achieved high perception accuracy: strawberry detection (precision 0.895, recall 0.813), hand detection (0.972/0.958); strawberry segmentation (precision 0.887, recall 0.747), hand segmentation (0.974/0.947); ripeness estimation (MAE 0.035) while maintaining 163.35 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: The integrated visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework effectively addresses key challenges in strawberry harvesting robots, improving harvesting stability and efficiency through unified perception and corrective control strategies.

Abstract: Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.

Motivation: Existing robotic face research focuses on conversations or static expressions, but singing requires continuous emotional expression and coherence that current methods struggle to achieve.

Method: Avatar-driven framework: 1) Use portrait video generation models with human priors to synthesize singing avatars for expression/emotion guidance, 2) Transfer facial features to robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions spanning wide expression space.

Result: Method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Proposed Emotion Dynamic Range metric shows broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances.

Conclusion: The avatar-driven framework successfully enables robotic faces to perform appealing singing with continuous emotional expression, addressing limitations of previous methods focused on conversation or static expressions.

Abstract: Equipping robotic faces with singing capabilities is crucial for empathetic Human-Robot Interaction. However, existing robotic face driving research primarily focuses on conversations or mimicking static expressions, struggling to meet the high demands for continuous emotional expression and coherence in singing. To address this, we propose a novel avatar-driven framework for appealing robotic singing. We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate altitude estimation and reliable floor recognition are critical for mobile robot localization in complex multi-storey environments, but existing visual/LiDAR-based SLAM odometry alone is insufficient for reliable vertical localization.

Method: A robust, low-cost vertical estimation framework using differential barometric sensing integrated within a fully ROS-compliant software package, simultaneously publishing real-time altitude data from both stationary base station and mobile sensor for drift-free vertical localization.

Result: Achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification in challenging scenarios like enclosed stairwells and elevators, outperforming standalone visual/LiDAR-based SLAM odometry.

Conclusion: The ROS-compatible barometric module provides a practical, cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Accurate altitude estimation and reliable floor recognition are critical for mobile robot localization and navigation within complex multi-storey environments. In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost vertical estimation framework leveraging differential barometric sensing integrated within a fully ROS-compliant software package. Our system simultaneously publishes real-time altitude data from both a stationary base station and a mobile sensor, enabling precise and drift-free vertical localization. Empirical evaluations conducted in challenging scenarios -- such as fully enclosed stairwells and elevators, demonstrate that our proposed barometric pipeline achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification. In contrast, our results confirm that standalone height estimates, obtained solely from visual- or LiDAR-based SLAM odometry, are insufficient for reliable vertical localization. The proposed ROS-compatible barometric module thus provides a practical and cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments. The implementation of our method is released as open source at https://github.com/witsir/differential-barometric.

### [204] [CycleVLA: Proactive Self-Correcting Vision-Language-Action Models via Subtask Backtracking and Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02295)
*Chenyang Ma,Guangyu Yang,Kai Lu,Shitong Xu,Bill Byrne,Niki Trigoni,Andrew Markham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CycleVLA enables Vision-Language-Action models to proactively anticipate and recover from failures before they occur, rather than just fixing errors after they happen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot failure detection systems operate reactively (post hoc), only analyzing and correcting errors after failures occur. This work aims to shift to proactive self-correction that anticipates incipient failures before they fully manifest during execution.

Method: CycleVLA integrates three key components: 1) a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, 2) a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and 3) a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

Conclusion: CycleVLA successfully enables proactive self-correction in VLAs, moving beyond reactive failure handling to anticipate and prevent failures before they occur, with MBR decoding providing effective test-time scaling for improved retry success.

Abstract: Current work on robot failure detection and correction typically operate in a post hoc manner, analyzing errors and applying corrections only after failures occur. This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual ontology alignment by capturing subtle semantic similarities between entities across different languages, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Enrich ontology entities with contextual descriptions using novel techniques, generate embeddings with fine-tuned multilingual transformer model, use cosine similarity for matching, and apply threshold filtering to retain highly similar entity pairs.

Result: Achieved 71% F1 score (78% recall, 65% precision) on OAEI-2022 multifarm track, representing a 16% increase over the best baseline score.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment pipeline effectively captures subtle cross-lingual similarities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing baselines in cross-lingual ontology alignment.

Abstract: The paper presents our work on cross-lingual ontology alignment system which uses embedding based cosine similarity matching. The ontology entities are made contextually richer by creating descriptions using novel techniques. We use a fine-tuned transformer based multilingual model for generating better embeddings. We use cosine similarity to find positive ontology entities pairs and then apply threshold filtering to retain only highly similar entities. We have evaluated our work on OAEI-2022 multifarm track. We achieve 71% F1 score (78% recall and 65% precision) on the evaluation dataset, 16% increase from best baseline score. This suggests that our proposed alignment pipeline is able to capture the subtle cross-lingual similarities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic AI framework for autonomous credit risk assessment using multi-agent systems with reinforcement learning, natural language reasoning, and explainable AI modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitalization of financial services creates urgent need for autonomous, transparent, real-time credit risk decision systems that traditional ML models cannot provide due to lack of adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy.

Method: Multi-agent system with reinforcement learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, real-time data pipelines, agent collaboration protocols, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles.

Result: System outperforms traditional credit scoring models in decision speed, transparency, and responsiveness, but faces limitations including model drift risks, high-dimensional data interpretation inconsistencies, regulatory uncertainties, and infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Agentic AI framework has high potential to transform credit analytics; future research should focus on dynamic regulatory compliance, enhanced agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale cross-country implementation.

Abstract: Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face a fundamental tension between context window limits and information fidelity in long conversations. Existing approaches (truncation and summarization) either discard early information or lose nuanced details.

Method: CogCanvas extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval. The framework is training-free.

Result: On LoCoMo benchmark: 34.7% overall accuracy (+9.1pp vs RAG, +21.0pp vs GraphRAG). Temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG) - +530% relative improvement. Multi-hop causal reasoning: 81.0% pass rate vs 40.0% for GraphRAG. Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall with 93.0% exact match preservation.

Conclusion: While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training, CogCanvas provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable, training-free alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines for long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models face a fundamental tension between context window limits and information fidelity in long conversations. Existing approaches--truncation and summarization--either discard early information or lose nuanced details. We introduce CogCanvas, a training-free framework that extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval.
  On the LoCoMo benchmark, CogCanvas achieves 34.7% overall accuracy, outperforming RAG (25.6%, +9.1pp) and GraphRAG (13.7%, +21.0pp). The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.

### [209] [Energy-Aware Routing to Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00823)
*Austin R. Ellis-Mohr,Max Hartman,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes energy optimization for large reasoning models by developing variance-aware routing and dispatch policies that balance baseline and auxiliary energy usage to minimize waste while handling stochastic fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models have heterogeneous energy costs that vary by model choice and reasoning depth. Current systems waste energy due to improper balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations, leading to either baseline energy over-supply or persistent reliance on auxiliary energy.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework for variance-aware routing and dispatch policies that consider how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. Uses training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs to characterize routing behavior.

Result: Identifies a critical operating regime where neither auxiliary nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Shows that performance in this regime is volatility-limited and requires second-order characterization. Provides theoretical basis for energy-aware model routing policies.

Conclusion: Variance-aware routing and dispatch represents a principled design axis for optimizing energy usage in LRM systems. The critical regime framework and scaling-law-based dispatch policies provide foundations for developing energy-efficient model routing strategies.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.

### [210] [Decomposing LLM Self-Correction: The Accuracy-Correction Paradox and Error Depth Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00828)
*Yin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' intrinsic self-correction is ineffective; stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist correction, creating an Accuracy-Correction Paradox where weaker models correct better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate LLMs' self-correction capabilities by decomposing them into error detection, localization, and correction, challenging the common belief that LLMs can effectively correct their own outputs without external feedback.

Method: Decomposed self-correction into three sub-capabilities, conducted cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex dataset (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek, Claude), analyzed correction rates, and proposed the Error Depth Hypothesis.

Result: Found Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieved 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy) - 26.8% vs 16.7%. Error detection varied dramatically (10% to 82%) but didn't predict correction success. Providing error location hints hurt all models.

Conclusion: Self-correction capabilities don't scale linearly with model strength; stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist correction, challenging assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for self-refinement pipeline design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines.

*Deep Pankajbhai Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models notice hidden hints in questions but don't spontaneously mention them in explanations, revealing a gap between what influences their reasoning and what they report.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether AI explanations actually reveal what influenced the model's reasoning, particularly whether models mention embedded hints that affect their answers.

Method: Embedded hints in questions and measured whether 11 leading AI models mentioned them across over 9,000 test cases, with various conditions including direct questioning, awareness of being watched, and forced reporting.

Result: Models almost never mention hints spontaneously but admit noticing them when asked directly; awareness doesn't help; forced reporting causes false positives and reduces accuracy; preference-based hints are especially problematic.

Conclusion: Simply observing AI reasoning is insufficient to detect hidden influences - models can notice but choose not to report influential information, creating a transparency gap.

Abstract: When AI systems explain their reasoning step-by-step, practitioners often assume these explanations reveal what actually influenced the AI's answer. We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.

TL;DR: OmniNeuro is an interpretable BCI framework that adds transparency through physics, chaos, and quantum-inspired metrics, providing real-time neuro-sonification and AI reports to improve user understanding and regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of deep learning BCIs is hindered by their "black box" nature, which causes user frustration and poor neuroplasticity outcomes due to lack of transparency and explainability.

Method: OmniNeuro integrates three interpretability engines: (1) Physics (Energy), (2) Chaos (Fractal Complexity), and (3) Quantum-Inspired uncertainty modeling. These metrics drive real-time Neuro-Sonification and Generative AI Clinical Reports, and the framework is decoder-agnostic.

Result: Achieved mean accuracy of 58.52% on PhysioNet dataset (N=109). Qualitative pilot studies (N=3) confirmed that explainable feedback helps users regulate mental effort and reduces the "trial-and-error" phase.

Conclusion: OmniNeuro transforms BCIs from silent decoders into transparent feedback partners, acting as an essential interpretability layer for any state-of-the-art architecture to improve clinical adoption.

Abstract: While Deep Learning has improved Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) decoding accuracy, clinical adoption is hindered by the "Black Box" nature of these algorithms, leading to user frustration and poor neuroplasticity outcomes. We propose OmniNeuro, a novel HCI framework that transforms the BCI from a silent decoder into a transparent feedback partner. OmniNeuro integrates three interpretability engines: (1) Physics (Energy), (2) Chaos (Fractal Complexity), and (3) Quantum-Inspired uncertainty modeling. These metrics drive real-time Neuro-Sonification and Generative AI Clinical Reports. Evaluated on the PhysioNet dataset ($N=109$), the system achieved a mean accuracy of 58.52%, with qualitative pilot studies ($N=3$) confirming that explainable feedback helps users regulate mental effort and reduces the "trial-and-error" phase. OmniNeuro is decoder-agnostic, acting as an essential interpretability layer for any state-of-the-art architecture.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TPP-TAL is a plug-and-play framework that enhances temporal reasoning in LLMs for temporal point processes by explicitly aligning temporal dynamics with contextual semantics, improving event modeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context in temporal point processes, limiting LLMs' effectiveness in continuous-time event modeling despite their success in sequence modeling.

Method: TPP-TAL introduces a novel framework that explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding information into LLMs, rather than simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, enabling better perception of temporal dependencies and long-range interactions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets show TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling, providing a plug-and-play solution that significantly improves performance on temporal point process tasks.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

Method: Iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware with strategic augmentation, using curated dataset of 80,851 examples from cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces.

Result: Benchmark accuracy improved from 42.86% to 74.29% (31.4-point gain), with targeted examples outperforming indiscriminate scaling; complete open release of datasets and tools.

Conclusion: Established first reproducible framework for building custom agentic security models, though practical deployment requires human oversight due to false positive rates.

Abstract: We present an openly documented methodology for fine-tuning language models to detect temporal attack patterns in multi-agent AI workflows using OpenTelemetry trace analysis. We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.86% to 74.29%, a statistically significant 31.4-point gain. Targeted examples addressing specific knowledge gaps outperform indiscriminate scaling. Key contributions include: (1) synthetic trace generation methodology for multi-agent coordination attacks and regulatory violations, (2) empirical evidence that training data composition fundamentally determines behavior, and (3) complete open release of datasets, training scripts, and evaluation benchmarks on HuggingFace. While practical deployment requires human oversight due to false positive rates, this work establishes the first reproducible framework enabling practitioners to build custom agentic security models adapted to their threat landscapes.

TL;DR: Chinese LLMs show 30.6% higher brand mention rates than international LLMs due to training data geography, creating "Existence Gap" where brands absent from training lack AI visibility regardless of quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly mediate consumer information discovery, brands face algorithmic invisibility. The study investigates systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from LLM training data composition, particularly how cultural encoding affects brand visibility.

Method: Analyzed 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands. Compared brand mention rates between Chinese and International LLMs. Conducted case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge) platform to demonstrate Linguistic Boundary Barriers.

Result: Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6 percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%, p<.001). The disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data geography drives the effect. Zhizibianjie had 65.6% mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001).

Conclusion: Introduces "Existence Gap" concept where brands absent from LLM training lack AI existence regardless of quality. Proposes Data Moat Framework conceptualizing AI-visible content as strategic resource. Recommends Algorithmic Omnipresence as objective for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and provides 18-month roadmap for brands to build Data Moats through semantic coverage, technical depth, and cultural localization.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate consumer information discovery,
  brands face algorithmic invisibility. This study investigates Cultural Encoding in Large
  Language Models (LLMs) -- systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from
  training data composition. Analyzing 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o,
  Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands, we find Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6
  percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%,
  p<.001). This disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data
  geography -- not language -- drives the effect. We introduce the Existence Gap: brands
  absent from LLM training corpora lack "existence" in AI responses regardless of quality.
  Through a case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge), a collaboration platform with 65.6%
  mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001), we demonstrate how
  Linguistic Boundary Barriers create invisible market entry obstacles. Theoretically, we
  contribute the Data Moat Framework, conceptualizing AI-visible content as a VRIN strategic
  resource. We operationalize Algorithmic Omnipresence -- comprehensive brand visibility
  across LLM knowledge bases -- as the strategic objective for Generative Engine Optimization
  (GEO). Managerially, we provide an 18-month roadmap for brands to build Data Moats
  through semantic coverage, technical depth, and cultural localization. Our findings reveal
  that in AI-mediated markets, the limits of a brand's "Data Boundaries" define the limits
  of its "Market Frontiers."

TL;DR: UCL is a mathematical framework that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization, achieving 29.8% token reduction through structural overhead analysis and model-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move prompt engineering from heuristic practice to systematic mathematical optimization, addressing the lack of formal frameworks for efficient LLM interaction and cost reduction.

Method: Developed Universal Conditional Logic (UCL) framework with core mechanisms including indicator functions, structural overhead function O_s(A), early binding, and systematic evaluation across 11 models with 4 iterations (N=305).

Result: Achieved significant token reduction (29.8%) with corresponding cost savings, identified Over-Specification Paradox threshold S* = 0.509, validated core mechanisms, and found optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture.

Conclusion: UCL establishes a calibratable framework for efficient LLM interaction, with model-family-specific optimization as a key research direction, demonstrating systematic optimization outperforms heuristic prompt engineering.

Abstract: We present Universal Conditional Logic (UCL), a mathematical framework for prompt optimization that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization. Through systematic evaluation (N=305, 11 models, 4 iterations), we demonstrate significant token reduction (29.8%, t(10)=6.36, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.01) with corresponding cost savings. UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1). This work establishes UCL as a calibratable framework for efficient LLM interaction, with model-family-specific optimization as a key research direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Counterfactual Self-Questioning enables language models to generate and evaluate alternative reasoning paths to improve their own reasoning without external critics or reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-improvement methods rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. There's a need for simpler, more stable approaches that use only the model's internal capabilities.

Method: A single language model generates an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions challenging potential failure points, and creates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback for direct policy optimization.

Result: Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show improved accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using only internally generated supervision.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Self-Questioning provides an effective framework for language model self-improvement that reduces complexity and improves stability by eliminating the need for external critics or reward models.

Abstract: Recent work on language model self-improvement shows that models can refine their own reasoning through reflection, verification, debate, or self-generated rewards. However, most existing approaches rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone.

### [219] [Context Collapse: In-Context Learning and Model Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00923)
*Josef Ott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thesis analyzes in-context learning phase transitions in linear transformers and model collapse in data regimes, introducing new concept of "context collapse" linking ICL dynamics with generative model stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental phenomena in LLMs: in-context learning dynamics and model collapse, and to explore their connection through a new concept of context collapse during long generations.

Method: 1) Study ICL in linear transformers with tied weights on linear regression tasks, reducing forward pass to preconditioned gradient descent. 2) Analyze model collapse using martingale and random walk theory in simplified settings (linear regression, Gaussian fitting) under different data regimes. 3) Introduce and analyze context collapse concept.

Result: 1) Found phase transition in ICL: above critical context length, solution develops skew-symmetric component inducing gradient rotation. 2) Proved almost sure convergence for model collapse, showing collapse occurs unless data grows fast or is retained. 3) Identified context collapse as degradation during long generations, linking ICL dynamics with stability challenges.

Conclusion: The thesis provides theoretical foundations for understanding ICL phase transitions, model collapse conditions, and introduces context collapse as a unifying concept connecting in-context learning dynamics with long-term stability issues in generative models.

Abstract: This thesis investigates two key phenomena in large language models (LLMs): in-context learning (ICL) and model collapse. We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.

Abstract: This paper introduces ElecTwit, a simulation framework designed to study persuasion within multi-agent systems, specifically emulating the interactions on social media platforms during a political election. By grounding our experiments in a realistic environment, we aimed to overcome the limitations of game-based simulations often used in prior research. We observed the comprehensive use of 25 specific persuasion techniques across most tested LLMs, encompassing a wider range than previously reported. The variations in technique usage and overall persuasion output between models highlight how different model architectures and training can impact the dynamics in realistic social simulations. Additionally, we observed unique phenomena such as "kernel of truth" messages and spontaneous developments with an "ink" obsession, where agents collectively demanded written proof. Our study provides a foundation for evaluating persuasive LLM agents in real-world contexts, ensuring alignment and preventing dangerous outcomes.

*Wuzhenghong Wen,Chao Xue,Su Pan,Yuwei Sun,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MRE framework enhances TKGQA by combining prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and tree-structured reinforcement learning to improve multi-hop reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGQA approaches suffer from suboptimal decisions and error propagation due to retrieving numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations at each hop, requiring better identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories.

Method: Multi-hop Reasoning Enhanced (MRE) framework with three components: 1) prompt engineering to generate diverse reasoning trajectories, 2) supervised fine-tuning on valid trajectories for cold-start, and 3) Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) - a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach that establishes causal dependencies between hops and uses multi-path feedback.

Result: Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks show MRE consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries, with improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations.

Conclusion: The MRE framework effectively addresses challenges in TKGQA by enhancing both forward and backward reasoning, leading to better identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories and superior performance on complex temporal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) involves multi-hop reasoning over temporally constrained entity relationships in the knowledge graph to answer a given question. However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations.

### [222] [Accelerating Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Optimized Posterior Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01301)
*Keith Frankston,Benjamin Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RMCTS is a faster AlphaZero-style MCTS algorithm using breadth-first search and recursive posterior policy computation, achieving 40x speedup for single states and matching MCTS-UCB network quality in 1/3 training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB suffers from GPU latency issues due to sequential network inferences. RMCTS aims to significantly accelerate search by exploring trees in breadth-first manner, enabling batched network inferences and reducing GPU latency costs.

Method: RMCTS uses recursive computation of optimized posterior policies from leaves to root, based on Grill et al.'s regularized policy optimization framework. It explores trees by following prior network policies (non-adaptive) rather than adaptive UCB selection, enabling breadth-first exploration and batched GPU inference.

Result: RMCTS achieves >40x speedup over MCTS-UCB for single root state searches, ~3x faster for batch searches, and matches MCTS-UCB-trained network quality in one-third training time across Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello games.

Conclusion: RMCTS provides substantial speed advantages over traditional MCTS-UCB while maintaining comparable network quality, making it a practical alternative for AlphaZero-style training where computational efficiency is critical.

Abstract: We introduce a recursive AlphaZero-style Monte--Carlo tree search algorithm, "RMCTS". The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.
  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in "Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.
  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello.

Abstract: Digital twins, as precise digital representations of physical systems, have evolved from passive simulation tools into intelligent and autonomous entities through the integration of artificial intelligence technologies. This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.

TL;DR: JiSi framework enables open-source LLM collaboration to surpass Gemini-3-Pro performance at 47% cost by addressing routing and aggregation bottlenecks through query-response mixed routing, support-set-based aggregator selection, and adaptive routing-aggregation switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM collaboration approaches face three key bottlenecks: query-based routers focus only on textual similarity, static aggregation methods fail to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks, and underutilized complementarity between routing and aggregation. The authors propose collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling.

Method: JiSi framework introduces three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing that captures both semantic information and problem difficulty, (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection that jointly evaluates aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators, and (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch that dynamically leverages advantages of both routing and aggregation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks show JiSi surpasses Gemini-3-Pro performance while using only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs. The framework also outperforms mainstream baselines.

Conclusion: Collective intelligence through frameworks like JiSi represents a novel path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), demonstrating that open-source LLM collaboration can surpass state-of-the-art monolithic models at significantly reduced cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, with Gemini-3-Pro setting a new performance milestone. In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FuXi-Uni is a unified multimodal AI model that understands and generates high-dimensional scientific data across domains like Earth science and Biomedicine within a single architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery requires integrating heterogeneous, high-dimensional data across disciplines, but current AI models are domain-specific and lack multimodal understanding/generation capabilities needed for cross-disciplinary global challenges.

Method: Aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens with natural language tokens and uses a science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction in a unified architecture.

Result: Outperforms SOTA physical forecasting systems in 10-day global weather forecasts at 0.25° resolution, shows superior TC track/intensity prediction, generates high-resolution regional weather fields surpassing interpolation baselines, and beats leading multimodal LLMs on biomedical VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: FuXi-Uni represents progress toward general-purpose multimodal scientific models by unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities in a shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance.

Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous, high-dimensional data across disciplines nowadays. While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25° resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.

TL;DR: KGCE is a benchmarking platform for evaluating multimodal LLM agents in educational cross-platform tasks, using knowledge base enhancement and dual-graph evaluation to address deficiencies in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark frameworks have deficiencies in supporting cross-platform educational tasks, especially with school-specific software where agent efficiency decreases due to lack of structural understanding. Current evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics that fail to capture detailed execution in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes KGCE platform with knowledge base enhancement for school-specific software and a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into sub-goals for fine-grained verification. Constructed dataset of 104 education-related tasks across Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative scenarios.

Result: Developed an enhanced agent system incorporating knowledge base for private-domain tasks. Created a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework that provides fine-grained metrics for assessing agent performance in educational cross-platform environments.

Conclusion: KGCE addresses critical gaps in benchmarking multimodal LLM agents for educational cross-platform tasks by integrating knowledge base enhancement and dual-graph evaluation, enabling more accurate assessment of agent efficiency in complex educational software environments.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLMs) in autonomous agents, cross-platform task execution capabilities in educational settings have garnered significant attention. However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

*Han Yuan,Yilin Wu,Li Zhang,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAA pipeline improves financial classification in small language models by detecting and mitigating factual hallucinations through association identification, automated detection, and adaptive inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly used in finance for their fast inference and local deployability, but they suffer from factual hallucinations and weaker classification performance compared to large models. The paper investigates whether mitigating factual hallucinations can improve SLMs' financial classification capabilities.

Method: Proposes AAAI pipeline with three steps: Association Identification (finding relationships between factual errors and misclassifications), Automated Detection (using encoder-based verifiers to detect factual hallucinations), and Adaptive Inference (incorporating feedback on factual errors to enable SLMs to adapt and improve classification).

Result: Experiments on three representative SLMs show: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications, (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations, and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables adaptive inference that enhances classification performance.

Conclusion: The AAAI pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance by addressing the critical issue of factual hallucinations, demonstrating that mitigating such errors can significantly improve SLMs' classification performance in financial domains.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly used for financial classification due to their fast inference and local deployability. However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance.

TL;DR: Neural network-enhanced DML framework uses text embeddings to reduce bias in causal estimation from 24% to -0.86% compared to tree-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional econometric methods fail with unobserved confounders orthogonal to structured covariates, but high-dimensional unstructured text contains rich proxies for these latent variables.

Method: Proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework that leverages text embeddings for causal identification, using deep learning to model continuous topology of embedding manifolds.

Result: Text embeddings capture confounding information absent from structured data. Standard tree-based DML retains 24% bias, while deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86%, effectively recovering ground-truth causal parameter.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures are essential for satisfying unconfoundedness assumption when conditioning on high-dimensional natural language data.

Abstract: Estimating causal treatment effects in observational settings is frequently compromised by selection bias arising from unobserved confounders. While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter. These findings suggest that deep learning architectures are essential for satisfying the unconfoundedness assumption when conditioning on high-dimensional natural language data

### [230] [Bayesian Orchestration of Multi-LLM Agents for Cost-Aware Sequential Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01522)
*Danial Amin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs as autonomous agents in asymmetric cost settings need Bayesian multi-model orchestration instead of single-model thresholding for better cost efficiency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM deployment in high-stakes sequential decisions (hiring, medical triage, fraud detection) uses single-model confidence thresholding, which is inadequate for asymmetric error costs and doesn't support coherent belief updating.

Method: Bayesian framework treating LLMs as likelihood models: contrastive prompting for likelihood elicitation, robust aggregation across multiple LLMs, Bayesian belief updating with explicit priors, and value-of-information for information gathering.

Result: In resume screening with asymmetric costs, reduces total cost by 34% ($294K) vs best single-LLM baseline, improves demographic parity by 45% (gap reduced from 22% to 5%). Savings attributed to multi-LLM aggregation (51%), sequential updating (43%), and disagreement-triggered information gathering (20%).

Conclusion: Proper probabilistic foundations (Bayesian multi-LLM orchestration) significantly outperform single-LLM approaches in asymmetric cost sequential decisions, enabling cost-aware action selection, coherent belief updating, and fairness improvements through ensemble bias mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous decision agents in settings with asymmetric error costs: hiring (missed talent vs wasted interviews), medical triage (missed emergencies vs unnecessary escalation), and fraud detection (approved fraud vs declined legitimate payments). The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds "confidence," and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Project Aletheia, a framework to measure "Cognitive Conviction" in AI reasoning models using Tikhonov Regularization and a Synthetic Proxy Protocol, introducing metrics to quantify belief depth while ensuring safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation paradigms focus on knowledge breadth but fail to measure belief depth, creating an epistemological crisis in AGI development. The paper aims to address this gap by quantifying cognitive conviction in System 2 reasoning models.

Method: Project Aletheia uses Tikhonov Regularization to invert confusion matrices from judges, implements a Synthetic Proxy Protocol for validation without private data, and introduces the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to ensure safety.

Result: Preliminary study on 2025 models (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) shows reasoning models act as cognitive buffers but exhibit "Defensive OverThinking" under adversarial pressure, while maintaining safety through aligned conviction metrics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a blueprint for measuring AI scientific integrity by quantifying cognitive conviction in reasoning models while ensuring safety alignment, addressing critical gaps in current AGI evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: In the progressive journey toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), current evaluation paradigms face an epistemological crisis. Static benchmarks measure knowledge breadth but fail to quantify the depth of belief. While Simhi et al. (2025) defined the CHOKE phenomenon in standard QA, we extend this framework to quantify "Cognitive Conviction" in System 2 reasoning models. We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a "cognitive buffer," they may exhibit "Defensive OverThinking" under adversarial pressure. Furthermore, we introduce the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to verify that conviction does not compromise safety. This work serves as a blueprint for measuring AI scientific integrity.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework (context formation + context navigation) improves LLM alignment with human behavior in complex decision-making tasks, validated across multiple experimental games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly simulate human behavior in experiments but systematically diverge from human decisions in complex strategic environments requiring anticipation of others' actions and belief formation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Context formation - explicitly specifying experimental design for accurate task representation; 2) Context navigation - guiding reasoning within that representation. Validated through replication of sequential purchasing game with quality signaling, crowdfunding game with costly signaling, and demand-estimation task across four SOTA LLMs.

Result: Complex decision-making environments require both stages for behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, while simpler demand-estimation tasks require only context formation. Framework works across GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, and DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: The framework clarifies when each stage is necessary and provides systematic approach for designing/diagnosing LLM social simulations as complements to human subjects in behavioral research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in experimental settings, but they systematically diverge from human decisions in complex decision-making environments, where participants must anticipate others' actions and form beliefs based on observed behavior. We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation. Our findings clarify when each stage is necessary and provide a systematic approach for designing and diagnosing LLM social simulations as complements to human subjects in behavioral research.

TL;DR: Logics-STEM is a reasoning model fine-tuned on a 10M-scale STEM dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance through data-algorithm co-design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities in STEM domains by combining large-scale open-source data with synthetic data through a co-design approach.

Method: Data-algorithm co-design engine: 5-stage data curation (annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, stratified sampling) plus failure-driven post-training with targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failures.

Result: Achieves 4.68% average improvement over next-best 8B-scale model on STEM benchmarks; releases 8B/32B models and 10M/2.2M datasets publicly.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of combining large-scale open-source data with synthetic data through data-algorithm co-design to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present Logics-STEM, a state-of-the-art reasoning model fine-tuned on Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset, a high-quality and diverse dataset at 10M scale that represents one of the largest-scale open-source long chain-of-thought corpora. Logics-STEM targets reasoning tasks in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and exhibits exceptional performance on STEM-related benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.68% over the next-best model at 8B scale. We attribute the gains to our data-algorithm co-design engine, where they are jointly optimized to fit a gold-standard distribution behind reasoning. Data-wise, the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset is constructed from a meticulously designed data curation engine with 5 stages to ensure the quality, diversity, and scalability, including annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, and stratified sampling. Algorithm-wise, our failure-driven post-training framework leverages targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failure regions in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage to effectively guide the second-stage SFT or the reinforcement learning (RL) for better fitting the target distribution. The superior empirical performance of Logics-STEM reveals the vast potential of combining large-scale open-source data with carefully designed synthetic data, underscoring the critical role of data-algorithm co-design in enhancing reasoning capabilities through post-training. We make both the Logics-STEM models (8B and 32B) and the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset (10M and downsampled 2.2M versions) publicly available to support future research in the open-source community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaveAgent transforms LLMs from text generators to runtime operators using dual-stream architecture and stateful runtime management for complex task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents are constrained by text-centric paradigms and procedural JSON-based function calling, which struggle with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift.

Method: Introduces Dual-stream Context Architecture decoupling state management into semantic stream for reasoning and Python Runtime stream for execution, plus Stateful Runtime Management for injecting, manipulating, and retrieving persistent Python objects across turns.

Result: Achieves 10.5% success rate improvement on retail tasks, reduces total token consumption by 28.4% in multi-turn scenarios, and reduces token consumption by 59% on data-intensive tasks while handling large-scale data that causes context overflow in other agents.

Conclusion: CaveAgent effectively transforms the LLM paradigm from text generator to runtime operator, eliminating context drift and catastrophic forgetting while enabling lossless data flow to downstream applications through persistent object management.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms. Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from "LLM-as-Text-Generator" to "LLM-as-Runtime-Operator." We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.

### [235] [Structured Decomposition for LLM Reasoning: Cross-Domain Validation and Semantic Web Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01609)
*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs translate unstructured text into structured assertions, which are then processed by symbolic reasoners for auditable rule-based reasoning across legal, scientific, and clinical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based reasoning over natural language requires both interpretive flexibility (handling prose) and formal guarantees (consistent rule application). LLMs provide flexibility but lack consistency guarantees, while symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input.

Method: Integration pattern combining LLMs as ontology population engines (translating text into ABox assertions) with SWRL-based reasoners applying rules deterministically. Framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification using OWL 2 ontologies.

Result: Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay, scientific method-task, clinical trial eligibility) with eleven language models show statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting. Symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines LLM flexibility with symbolic reasoning guarantees, enabling auditable rule application across domains while maintaining integration with semantic web tooling for richer inference patterns.

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning over natural language input arises in domains where decisions must be auditable and justifiable: clinical protocols specify eligibility criteria in prose, evidence rules define admissibility through textual conditions, and scientific standards dictate methodological requirements. Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents combining foundation models with reasoning, planning, memory, and tool use are becoming practical interfaces between natural-language intent and real-world computation, requiring systematic understanding of emerging architectures.

Method: Synthesizes prior work into unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, critics), orchestration patterns (single/multi-agent, centralized/decentralized), and deployment settings (offline/online, safety-critical/open-ended).

Result: Organizes AI agent landscape across three key areas: deliberation/reasoning (chain-of-thought, self-reflection, constraint-aware decisions), planning/control (reactive policies to hierarchical planners), and tool calling/environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, multimodal perception).

Conclusion: Identifies key design trade-offs (latency vs accuracy, autonomy vs controllability, capability vs reliability), evaluation complications, and open challenges including verification for tool actions, scalable memory management, interpretability, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads.

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that combine foundation models with reasoning, planning, memory, and tool use -- are rapidly becoming a practical interface between natural-language intent and real-world computation. This survey synthesizes the emerging landscape of AI agent architectures across: (i) deliberation and reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought-style decomposition, self-reflection and verification, and constraint-aware decision making), (ii) planning and control (from reactive policies to hierarchical and multi-step planners), and (iii) tool calling and environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, and multimodal perception). We organize prior work into a unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, and critics), orchestration patterns (single-agent vs.\ multi-agent; centralized vs.\ decentralized coordination), and deployment settings (offline analysis vs.\ online interactive assistance; safety-critical vs.\ open-ended tasks). We discuss key design trade-offs -- latency vs.\ accuracy, autonomy vs.\ controllability, and capability vs.\ reliability -- and highlight how evaluation is complicated by non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, tool and environment variability, and hidden costs such as retries and context growth. Finally, we summarize measurement and benchmarking practices (task suites, human preference and utility metrics, success under constraints, robustness and security) and identify open challenges including verification and guardrails for tool actions, scalable memory and context management, interpretability of agent decisions, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in RTL code generation mainly focus on syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality (power, performance, area), creating a gap in assessing real-world hardware design capabilities.

Method: Created RTL-OPT benchmark with 36 handcrafted digital designs covering combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides suboptimal RTL code and human-optimized reference reflecting industry-proven patterns. Includes automated evaluation framework for functional verification and PPA quantification.

Result: Developed a comprehensive benchmark that enables standardized assessment of LLMs' RTL optimization capabilities, addressing the gap in evaluating optimization quality beyond just syntactic correctness.

Conclusion: RTL-OPT provides a meaningful evaluation framework for assessing generative models in hardware design optimization, focusing on practical PPA improvements rather than just code generation correctness.

Abstract: The rapid progress of artificial intelligence increasingly relies on efficient integrated circuit (IC) design. Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, but existing benchmarks mainly evaluate syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA). This work introduces RTL-OPT, a benchmark for assessing the capability of LLMs in RTL optimization. RTL-OPT contains 36 handcrafted digital designs that cover diverse implementation categories including combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides a pair of RTL codes, a suboptimal version and a human-optimized reference that reflects industry-proven optimization patterns not captured by conventional synthesis tools. Furthermore, RTL-OPT integrates an automated evaluation framework to verify functional correctness and quantify PPA improvements, enabling standardized and meaningful assessment of generative models for hardware design optimization.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are better at symbolic manipulation than direct numerical solving for transcendental equations; hybrid approaches with classical solvers reduce errors by 68-82%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solutions are common in engineering, but it's unclear whether LLMs can solve them directly or need hybrid approaches combining symbolic manipulation with classical solvers.

Method: Tested 6 state-of-the-art LLMs on 100 problems across 7 engineering domains, comparing direct numerical prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson performs numerical solution.

Result: Direct prediction had mean relative errors of 0.765-1.262, while solver-assisted computation achieved 0.225-0.301, representing 67.9-81.8% error reductions. Electronics showed 93.1% improvement due to exponential sensitivity, while Fluid Mechanics had only 7.2% gain.

Conclusion: Contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.

Abstract: Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable AI for psychological assessment by addressing three key challenges: creating realistic longitudinal counseling AI, enabling multi-therapy flexibility, and establishing systematic evaluation frameworks for AI counselors.

Method: Created a multi-session benchmark spanning 6-10 sessions across three stages with extensive skill annotations (677 meta-skills, 4577 atomic skills). Constructed diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities plus integrative therapy across six psychological topics. Built over 2,000 diverse client profiles and established holistic evaluation with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics.

Result: Extensive experimental analysis validated the superior quality and clinical fidelity of the dataset. PsychEval serves as both a benchmark and a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment for self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible AI counselors.

Conclusion: PsychEval transcends static benchmarking to enable the development of adaptive, clinically responsible AI counselors through multi-session, multi-therapy realistic scenarios and comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: To develop a reliable AI for psychological assessment, we introduce \texttt{PsychEval}, a multi-session, multi-therapy, and highly realistic benchmark designed to address three key challenges: \textbf{1) Can we train a highly realistic AI counselor?} Realistic counseling is a longitudinal task requiring sustained memory and dynamic goal tracking. We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset. Crucially, \texttt{PsychEval} transcends static benchmarking to serve as a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment that enables the self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible and adaptive AI counselors.

TL;DR: Admissibility Alignment reframes AI alignment as probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with MAP-AI as a system architecture using Monte Carlo estimation to evaluate policies across outcome distributions rather than static constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment approaches treat alignment as static or binary conditions rather than probabilistic decision-making properties under uncertainty. There's a need to evaluate alignment through policy behavior across distributions of outcomes, especially for enterprise/institutional AI systems where impact depends on policy behavior across distributions and tail events.

Method: MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) architecture uses Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection. It evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties (expected utility, variance, tail risk, probability of misalignment).

Result: Provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in AI systems, distinguishing probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty. Enables admissibility-controlled action selection that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.

Conclusion: Admissibility Alignment offers a practical foundation for governing AI systems by treating alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property evaluated through policy behavior across outcome distributions, moving beyond static model-level constraints to distributional evaluation under uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.
  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are deployed in high-stakes enterprise applications (healthcare, finance), ensuring adherence to organization-specific policies has become essential, but existing safety evaluations focus only on universal harms, leaving organizational policy compliance unaddressed.

Method: COMPASS (Company/Organization Policy Alignment Assessment) systematically evaluates LLM compliance with organizational allowlist and denylist policies. Applied to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries testing both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases.

Result: Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models revealed a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety.

Abstract: As large language models are deployed in high-stakes enterprise applications, from healthcare to finance, ensuring adherence to organization-specific policies has become essential. Yet existing safety evaluations focus exclusively on universal harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG construction methods for clinical narratives rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, which is especially problematic in oncology where precision is critical.

Method: End-to-end framework using multi-agent prompting and schema-constrained KG-RAG strategy with: (1) prompt-driven entity/attribute/relation extraction, (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring, (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation, and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement.

Result: Applied to PDAC and BRCA oncology cohorts, the method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, clinically grounded knowledge graphs without gold-standard annotations, demonstrating consistent gains in precision, relevance, and ontology compliance over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation for iterative improvement of graph quality, offering a robust solution for clinical KG construction from unstructured narratives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured clinical narratives. However, existing approaches often rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, limitations that are especially problematic in oncology. We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations. Experimental results demonstrate consistent gains in precision, relevance, and ontology compliance over baseline methods.

Motivation: While LLM-based agents have advanced, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored, especially for improving context understanding, tool usage, and response generation in real-world applications.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) adaptive prompt generation aligned with agent state and task goals, (2) context-aware tool orchestration with categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation, and (3) layered memory integrating session memory, task history, and external summaries with dynamic compression.

Result: 20% improvement in task accuracy, reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. Framework deployed in Jenius platform, providing lightweight and scalable solution for robust autonomous agents.

Conclusion: Jenius-Agent offers a practical, optimized framework for LLM-based autonomous agents with significant performance improvements and real-world deployment success, addressing key challenges in agent reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving the task performance of an autonomous agent, especially in context understanding, tool usage, and response generation, has become increasingly critical. Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQL-based agentic framework for pathology image analysis that links cellular feature measurements to diagnostic conclusions through executable SQL traces, improving interpretability and decision traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for pathology image analysis produce correlational explanations without verifiable evidence, lacking the ability to show which slide features drive decisions and why - a critical need for clinical diagnosis.

Method: SQL-centered agentic framework with Feature Reasoning Agents that compose/execute SQL queries over extracted cellular feature tables, and Knowledge Comparison Agent that evaluates findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring pathologists' reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate improved interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.

Conclusion: The SQL-based agentic framework enables auditable feature measurement and reasoning in pathology image analysis, providing verifiable evidence and traceable decision-making that aligns with clinical diagnostic practices.

Abstract: Automated pathology image analysis is central to clinical diagnosis, but clinicians still ask which slide features drive a model's decision and why. Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations. Extensive experiments evaluated on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate our method improves interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.

*Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Suhaib Abdurahman,Zhivar Sourati,Jackson Trager,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a fundamental theory gap in socio-cognitive LLM evaluations that leads to systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results, and proposes Theory Trace Cards (TTCs) as documentation artifacts to make evaluation assumptions explicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current socio-cognitive benchmarks for LLMs often fail to predict real-world performance despite high scores, creating an evaluation-deployment gap. While prior work focused on measurement and validity issues, this paper argues the core problem is the lack of explicit theoretical specification of target capabilities, leading to systematic misinterpretation of narrow benchmark results as evidence of broad competence.

Method: The paper makes two contributions: 1) Diagnoses and formalizes the theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization, and 2) Introduces Theory Trace Cards (TTCs) - lightweight documentation artifacts that explicitly outline the theoretical basis of evaluations, components of target capabilities exercised, operationalization, and limitations.

Result: The proposed TTCs enhance interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain linking theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without requiring benchmark modifications or agreement on a single theory.

Conclusion: The theory gap in socio-cognitive evaluations creates a systemic validity illusion by masking failures to evaluate essential dimensions of capabilities. TTCs provide a practical solution to improve evaluation transparency and prevent overgeneralization of benchmark results, addressing a fundamental issue that measurement-focused critiques have overlooked.

Abstract: Socio-cognitive benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often fail to predict real-world behavior, even when models achieve high benchmark scores. Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.

*Minh Hieu Ha,Khanh Ly Ta,Hung Phan,Tung Doan,Tung Dao,Dao Tran,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMP-A* integrates vision-language models with adaptive decay to provide geometrically-grounded waypoint guidance for autonomous navigation, reducing computational costs while maintaining near-optimal trajectories in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical A* is computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios, while text-only LLM approaches lack spatial grounding and produce incorrect waypoints in complex environments with dead ends and ambiguous boundaries.

Method: MMP-A* combines vision-language models for spatial grounding with an adaptive decay mechanism that dynamically regulates uncertain waypoint influence in the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while reducing memory overhead.

Result: The framework achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs in challenging environments with severe clutter and topological complexity.

Conclusion: MMP-A* demonstrates potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation by integrating multimodal reasoning with geometric precision.

Abstract: Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.
  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.

Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and explainable learning in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), particularly focusing on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as an effective approach for classification that can discover hidden relationships through concept lattices.

Method: The paper reviews existing FCA-based classifiers, explores methods for computing closure operators from nominal data, and introduces a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for constructing partial concept lattices, showing improved performance in focusing on relevant concepts for classification tasks.

Conclusion: FCA-based classifiers provide interpretable and explainable learning capabilities, and the proposed partial concept lattice construction method offers an efficient approach for focusing on relevant concepts in classification tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) aims to exploit the vast amounts of data generated daily across various domains of computer applications. Its objective is to extract hidden and meaningful knowledge from datasets through a structured process comprising several key steps: data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and visualization. Among the core data mining techniques are classification and clustering. Classification involves predicting the class of new instances using a classifier trained on labeled data. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChaosBench-Logic is a benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning on chaotic dynamical systems using first-order logic, revealing that while frontier LLMs achieve high per-item accuracy, they fail on compositional reasoning and show fragile global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are brittle in domains requiring precise logical and symbolic reasoning, and chaotic dynamical systems provide a demanding test case because chaos is deterministic but often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity.

Method: Created ChaosBench-Logic benchmark with 30 diverse dynamical systems annotated using a unified first-order logic ontology (11 semantic predicates), generating 621 questions across seven reasoning categories including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues.

Result: Frontier LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, LLaMA-3 70B) achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy but score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot).

Conclusion: ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing LLM reasoning failures and serves as a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches to improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but remain brittle in domains requiring precise logical and symbolic reasoning. Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot). ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing such failures and a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches that improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs for mental health support is challenging due to scarcity and sensitivity of real counseling dialogues, creating privacy concerns and data availability issues.

Method: 1) Created MindCorpus using multi-agent role-playing framework with dual closed-loop feedback (turn-level critique/revision and session-level strategy refinement); 2) Fine-tuned base model using federated learning with LoRA adapters and differential private optimization.

Result: MindCorpus improves training effectiveness; MindChat performs competitively with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines in both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluations, while showing reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables effective mental health support LLMs while addressing privacy concerns through synthetic data generation and privacy-preserving training techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for mental health support, yet training such models is constrained by the scarcity and sensitivity of real counseling dialogues. In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.

TL;DR: FMs challenge traditional symbolic reasoning by achieving problem-solving through imitation, testing, and iteration, revealing fundamentally different reasoning processes that require new philosophical interpretations and safety considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how Foundational Models challenge traditional understanding of reasoning as symbolic processes, and to explore philosophical implications of their different reasoning approach that lacks grounding and common sense.

Method: Philosophical analysis and interpretation of how FMs achieve reasoning through imitation of "thinking out loud," pathway testing, and iteration, comparing this to human symbolic reasoning.

Result: FMs demonstrate reasoning capabilities without symbolic grounding, revealing brittleness due to lack of common sense, necessitating abandonment of the "stochastic parrot" metaphor and new safety frameworks.

Conclusion: FMs fundamentally alter our understanding of reasoning's necessary conditions, requiring new philosophical interpretations, safety considerations, and normative frameworks for appropriate deployment.

Abstract: Reasoning has long been understood as a pathway between stages of understanding. Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., "symbolic reasoning". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can "reason" by way of imitating the process of "thinking out loud", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the "stochastic parrot" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL agents often exhibit erratic, high-frequency control behaviors that cause excessive energy consumption and mechanical wear, hindering real-world deployment in energy-critical applications like building management.

Conclusion: Higher-order action regularization serves as an effective bridge between RL optimization and operational constraints in energy-critical applications, enabling more practical deployment of RL agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned on FDM formulation data can recommend excipients and predict filament properties, but face challenges like catastrophic forgetting and limited evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the narrow focus of current AI approaches in pharmaceutical 3D printing by applying LLMs with general reasoning capabilities to solve broader formulation challenges.

Method: Fine-tuned four LLM architectures on a fused deposition modeling dataset of 1400+ formulations to recommend excipients based on API dose and predict filament mechanical properties, with systematic evaluation of fine-tuning and generative parameters.

Result: Llama2 performed best for excipient recommendations; model selection and parameterization significantly affect performance; smaller LLMs showed catastrophic forgetting; standard LLM metrics don't evaluate formulation processability; biomedical-trained LLMs don't always yield optimal results.

Conclusion: Addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting and developing better evaluation metrics beyond linguistic proficiency is essential for advancing LLMs toward reliable pharmaceutical formulation systems.

Abstract: Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Streaming hallucination detection for long chain-of-thought reasoning using cumulative prefix-level signals to track evolving latent states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in long chain-of-thought reasoning emerge subtly and propagate across steps, making them difficult to detect as one-off events. Current approaches fail to capture the evolving nature of hallucination states throughout the reasoning trajectory.

Method: Treat step-level hallucination judgments as local observations and introduce cumulative prefix-level hallucination signals that track the global evolution of reasoning states over the entire trajectory. This enables streaming detection in real-time.

Result: The approach provides real-time, interpretable evidence for hallucination detection in long CoT reasoning by monitoring the cumulative evolution of reasoning states rather than isolated errors.

Conclusion: Hallucination in long CoT reasoning should be understood as an evolving latent state, and tracking cumulative prefix-level signals enables effective streaming detection with interpretable evidence.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large language models, yet hallucinations in such settings often emerge subtly and propagate across reasoning steps. We suggest that hallucination in long CoT reasoning is better understood as an evolving latent state rather than a one-off erroneous event. Accordingly, we treat step-level hallucination judgments as local observations and introduce a cumulative prefix-level hallucination signal that tracks the global evolution of the reasoning state over the entire trajectory. Overall, our approach enables streaming hallucination detection in long CoT reasoning, providing real-time, interpretable evidence.

*Sourena Khanzadeh*

TL;DR: LLM agents' reasoning traces may be unfaithful rationalizations rather than genuine drivers of decisions; Project Ariadne uses causal interventions to detect this "Reasoning Theater" phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM agents handle high-stakes decisions, there's a critical need to verify whether their reasoning traces are faithful drivers of decisions or just post-hoc rationalizations, raising safety concerns about transparency.

Method: Project Ariadne uses Structural Causal Models and counterfactual logic to audit reasoning integrity. It performs hard interventions (do-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes by inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims to measure Causal Sensitivity (φ).

Result: Evaluation reveals a persistent Faithfulness Gap and widespread Causal Decoupling, with violation density (ρ) up to 0.77. Agents reach identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, showing reasoning traces function as "Reasoning Theater" while decisions are governed by latent parametric priors.

Conclusion: Current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanations. The Ariadne Score is proposed as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action to address this transparency problem.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While \textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($φ$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($ρ$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as "Reasoning Theater" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.

Abstract: This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\times$ to $7\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.
