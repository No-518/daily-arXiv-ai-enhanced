*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline automates conversion of raw video into rich supervision data for world-model training, using AI models for dense multimodal pre-annotation and achieving 80% reduction in human review volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of multimodal datasets for robust world models is slow and expensive, creating a bottleneck in training data preparation.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (i) normalize 360-degree video formats into standard views, (ii) apply AI models for scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, and content detection, (iii) consolidate signals into structured output for human validation.

Result: Achieved efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per review hour), reduced human review volume by >80% through conservative auto-skipping, and generated high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets with increased label density and consistency.

Conclusion: The GAZE workflow provides a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data while maintaining throughput and governance, enabling efficient learning of cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction.

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-UNet with PVMC-Loss improves PET image denoising by incorporating physical data constraints, addressing Poisson noise from low-dose imaging while maintaining image fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PET denoising methods fail to handle Poisson noise from low-dose imaging, causing distortions and artifacts, limiting clinical use due to radiation exposure concerns.

Method: Proposed Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) with Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data constraints and is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient adaptation.

Result: Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet improves physical consistency and image fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PC-UNet effectively integrates physical information to handle Poisson noise in low-dose PET imaging, offering robust denoising with improved image quality.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker is a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time method that mitigates semantic leakage in text-to-image models by dynamically reweighting attention maps to reduce cross-entity interactions while preserving entity identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image models suffer from semantic leakage - unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities, and existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or require external inputs.

Method: DeLeaker intervenes directly on the model's attention maps during diffusion process, dynamically reweighting them to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening each entity's identity.

Result: DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even those with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. The paper also introduces SLIM dataset with 1,130 human-verified samples for systematic evaluation.

Conclusion: Attention control is valuable for mitigating semantic leakage and paves the way for more semantically precise Text-to-Image models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse is a data-driven system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware simulation scenes for training urban embodied AI agents, achieving superior performance in navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation environments for urban AI agents lack scalability and fail to capture real-world complexity, creating a need for more realistic and scalable training environments.

Method: UrbanVerse consists of UrbanVerse-100K (100k+ annotated urban 3D assets) and UrbanVerse-Gen (automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from videos and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets), running in IsaacSim.

Result: UrbanVerse preserves real-world semantics and layouts with human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. Navigation policies trained in UrbanVerse show strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in sim-to-real transfer, completing a 300m real-world mission with only two interventions.

Conclusion: UrbanVerse enables scalable, realistic training of urban embodied AI agents through data-driven simulation, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation performance and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D is a training-free framework for precise 3D object editing that integrates FlowEdit with TRELLIS and introduces region-aware merging strategies (Voxel/Slat-Merge) to preserve structural fidelity without requiring masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D editing methods are inefficient, inconsistent, often fail to preserve unedited regions, and rely on multi-view rendering followed by reconstruction which introduces artifacts and limits practicality.

Method: Integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS for localized edits guided by front-view renderings, and introduces region-aware merging strategies (Voxel/Slat-Merge) that adaptively preserve structural fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas.

Result: Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality compared with existing methods. The authors also created Nano3D-Edit-100k, the first large-scale 3D editing dataset with over 100,000 high-quality 3D editing pairs.

Conclusion: This work addresses long-standing challenges in both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the development of feed-forward 3D editing models.

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

TL;DR: ECHO is a framework for creating image generation benchmarks from real-world social media posts, revealing novel capabilities and improving model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lag behind rapid advances in image generation and fail to capture emerging real-world use cases, creating a gap between community perceptions and formal evaluation.

Method: Constructed a dataset of over 31,000 prompts curated from social media posts showcasing novel prompts and qualitative user judgments, specifically applied to GPT-4o Image Gen.

Result: ECHO discovered creative tasks absent from existing benchmarks, better distinguished state-of-the-art models from alternatives, and surfaced community feedback for designing quality metrics.

Conclusion: The ECHO framework enables more relevant and timely evaluation of image generation models by directly incorporating real-world evidence of model use.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a submodular framework to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of selecting relevant and diverse LoRA models from large databases, addressing challenges in navigating and utilizing the vast number of available adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With over 100K LoRA adapters available on platforms like Civit.ai, users struggle to navigate, select, and effectively utilize suitable adapters due to the sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization.

Method: The paper frames LoRA model selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposes a novel submodular framework to select the most relevant and diverse models from the database.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.

Conclusion: The submodular framework effectively addresses the challenge of selecting relevant and diverse LoRA models from large databases, enabling better utilization of available adapters for personalized content generation.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS is a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation that achieves Pareto-optimal downscaling for efficient edge deployment while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for instance-level perception have high computational costs that limit adoption on resource-constrained platforms, creating a need for efficient architectures that don't compromise performance.

Method: Proposes three key innovations: (i) bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) streamlined unified training strategy.

Result: Reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75% respectively while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations.

Conclusion: MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation across both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGS is a data-efficient framework that equips MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities using small seed datasets by decomposing questions into primitive factors and systematically recomposing them with new images to generate synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal large language models lack reasoning capabilities in domains with scarce annotated data, particularly artificial image domains like charts, documents, and webpages that are abundant but lack large-scale human annotations.

Method: Decompose seed questions into primitive perception and reasoning factors, then systematically recompose these factors with new images to generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs with subquestions and intermediate answers for reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards.

Result: COGS substantially improves performance on unseen chart reasoning questions, with largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions, and enables better transfer across multiple datasets through factor-level mixture training.

Conclusion: COGS induces generalizable reasoning capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting and extends beyond charts to other domains like webpages, providing a scalable approach for enhancing MLLM reasoning with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen is a unified framework for simulating diverse physical dynamics (rigid, articulated, and soft bodies) using a potential energy perspective, enabling geometry-agnostic representation and inference from motion observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop generalist embodied agents in realistic digital twin worlds by creating a unified system that can handle complex physical behaviors across different material types in scannable environments.

Method: Uses a potential energy perspective where stable systems have low potential energy. Extends elastodynamics with directional stiffness to capture various physical behaviors. Employs a specialized network for material properties and neural field for geometry-agnostic deformation representation.

Result: GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation paradigms and provides a versatile foundation for interactive virtual environments and robotic agent training in complex dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates multiple physical dynamics into a unified system, enabling realistic simulation of complex physical behaviors for digital twin applications and embodied AI training.

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: COLIPRI introduces report generation and vision-only pre-training to overcome data limitations in 3D medical vision-language encoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language encoders in medical imaging are limited by data availability, which restricts their capabilities for tasks like abnormality retrieval and prediction.

Method: Introduces additional inductive biases through report generation objective and pairs vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training to leverage both image-only and paired image-text datasets.

Result: COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report generation, classification probing, zero-shot classification, and remain competitive for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Injecting inductive biases through multi-modal pre-training strategies effectively addresses data limitations in 3D medical imaging and enables superior performance across various clinical tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT is a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge from text-only LLMs to MLLMs through gradient-space injection, avoiding resource-intensive training while improving multimodal reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lag behind text-only LLMs in reasoning ability, and existing methods like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning are resource-intensive. Model merging shows inconsistent results across different model families.

Method: DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning, preserving multimodal alignment while transferring reasoning knowledge.

Result: DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance on benchmarks like MathVista and MathVerse, outperforming naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, and matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at lower cost.

Conclusion: DRIFT provides an efficient and effective approach to enhance MLLM reasoning capabilities without the computational overhead of traditional methods, offering a practical solution for reasoning transfer in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

### [13] [A solution to generalized learning from small training sets found in everyday infant experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15060)
*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Infants' visual input has a 'lumpy' similarity structure with clusters of similar images and rare variable ones, which helps them generalize object categories from limited experiences. This structure improves machine learning generalization from small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how infants can generalize basic object categories from limited visual experiences, despite typically requiring large datasets for robust learning in machine learning.

Method: Analyzed egocentric images from 14 infants (7-11 months old) to examine visual input structure, and conducted computational experiments mimicking this structure in machine learning.

Result: Infant visual input shows lumpy similarity structure with image clusters and rare variable images across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments confirmed this structure improves generalization from small datasets.

Conclusion: The natural lumpiness of infant visual experience supports early category learning and generalization, offering principles for efficient learning across different problems and learners.

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

### [14] [SaLon3R: Structure-aware Long-term Generalizable 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15072)
*Jiaxin Guo,Tongfan Guan,Wenzhen Dong,Wenzhao Zheng,Wenting Wang,Yue Wang,Yeung Yam,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R is a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction that eliminates redundancy through anchor primitives and resolves geometric inconsistencies using a 3D Point Transformer, achieving 50-90% redundancy removal while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies when processing long-duration video sequences, as they predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine all views without efficient compression.

Method: Introduces compact anchor primitives with differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency. Uses a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense Gaussians and saliency maps, then compresses redundant Gaussians into anchors prioritizing high-complexity regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis and depth estimation, with 50-90% redundancy removal, real-time processing (over 10 FPS), and reconstruction of over 50 views without test-time optimization or known camera parameters.

Conclusion: SaLon3R effectively resolves artifacts and prunes redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT) is a framework that uses point trajectories with localized text descriptions to control subject composition in text-to-video generation, addressing limitations of prior methods in complex multi-object scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard text-to-video generation methods have limited ability to control subject composition, especially in complex multi-object settings where prior approaches using bounding boxes or segmentation masks struggle with precision and entity correspondence.

Method: TGT introduces Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate trajectory and text signals, uses dual-CFG scheme for separate local and global text guidance, and employs a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities from 2 million annotated video clips.

Result: TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared to prior approaches, enabling intuitive control of both appearance and motion through point trajectories paired with text.

Conclusion: The TGT framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing text-to-video generation methods by providing precise control over subject composition through text-grounded trajectories, demonstrating superior performance in complex multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework that combines diffusion models with Bayesian inverse problems to solve medical imaging tasks, using diffusion models as anatomical priors for brain MRI analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between data-driven diffusion models and domain knowledge in medical imaging, addressing the limitations of classical mathematical priors that fail to capture complex brain anatomy while leveraging the strengths of Bayesian inverse problems.

Method: The method uses score-based diffusion priors trained on diverse brain MRI data, combined with flexible forward models for various image processing tasks including super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and their combinations.

Result: Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show state-of-the-art performance, producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets, and demonstrating the ability to refine outputs from existing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis, successfully combining data-driven generative models with domain knowledge for robust medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL enhances WSI classification by adding a frequency-domain branch to capture global dependencies, improving performance across multiple MIL methods and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for WSI classification struggle with global dependencies due to WSI size limitations and local patch embeddings, hindering robust diagnostic prediction.

Method: Extracts low-frequency crops via FFT, processes through FFT-Block with convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization, then fuses global frequency features with spatial patch features.

Result: Improved macro F1 scores by 3.51% and AUC by 1.51% across six MIL methods on three datasets (BRACS, LUAD, IMP), showing consistent gains.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain learning effectively captures global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing MIL-based computational pathology.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: XModBench is a tri-modal benchmark for evaluating cross-modal consistency in Omni-modal LLMs, revealing that even top models like Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle with modality-invariant reasoning and exhibit systematic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on general cross-modal QA but fail to assess whether OLLMs achieve true modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases.

Method: Created XModBench with 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning 5 task families, systematically covering all 6 modality compositions in question-answer pairs for fine-grained diagnosis.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro shows: (i) poor spatial/temporal reasoning (<60% accuracy), (ii) persistent modality disparities (audio worse than text), (iii) directional imbalance (vision context worse than text).

Conclusion: Current OLLMs are far from achieving modality-invariant reasoning, and XModBench serves as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence.

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

TL;DR: Proposes UniFilter, a unified multimodal data quality classifier to filter high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data for MLLM training using semi-synthetic data generation across quality levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data filtering for image-text interleaved document data in MLLM pre-training is under-explored, despite its importance for model performance.

Method: Uses semi-synthetic approach with raw images and generated text across four quality levels to create sample-score pairs for training UniFilter, then applies it to filter DataComp and OBELICS datasets.

Result: MLLMs pre-trained on UniFilter-filtered data show significantly enhanced zero-shot reasoning, in-context learning capabilities, and stronger performance on various benchmarks after visual supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: High-quality multimodal data filtering through UniFilter improves MLLM performance, with released data, model checkpoints, and curated OBELICS-HQ dataset for community use.

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Motivation: Address reproducibility challenges in foundation model training for histopathology caused by software randomness, hardware non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting.

Method: Trained CLIP model on QUILT-1M dataset and systematically evaluated different hyperparameter settings and augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, LC25000-Colon).

Result: Identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8 performed best, distributed training without local loss improved stability, learning rates below 5.0e-5 degraded performance, and LC25000 (Colon) provided most reproducible benchmark.

Conclusion: Reproducibility in computational pathology depends on both transparent documentation and carefully chosen experimental configurations, with practical rules provided to guide future reproducible foundation model development.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation methods struggle to balance fidelity and diversity, as they often preserve non-essential image attributes that conflict with text prompts, limiting their effectiveness in enhancing training datasets.

Method: Proposes a personalized image generation framework with salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce influence of irrelevant visual details during synthesis, maintaining better alignment between image and text inputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation methods across eight fine-grained vision datasets with averaged classification accuracy improvements of 0.73% (conventional) and 6.5% (long-tail settings).

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances training dataset diversity by preserving class-discriminative features while adding controlled variations, thereby improving downstream model robustness.

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARDIUM, the first public multimodal dataset for prenatal CHD detection combining fetal ultrasound/echocardiographic images with maternal clinical records, and proposes a cross-attention transformer that improves detection by 11-50% over single-modality approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prenatal CHD diagnosis faces challenges with imbalanced/low-quality datasets due to condition rarity, and lacks public multimodal datasets integrating imaging and clinical data, limiting AI model performance in clinical decision support.

Method: Proposed a robust multimodal transformer architecture with cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations from both image (fetal ultrasound/echocardiographic) and tabular (maternal clinical records) data.

Result: Achieved 11% improvement over image-only and 50% improvement over tabular-only approaches, with F1 score of 79.8 ± 4.8% on the CARDIUM dataset.

Conclusion: The CARDIUM dataset and proposed multimodal approach significantly enhance prenatal CHD detection, with public release of dataset and code to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Method: Examined demographic bias across different ad topics, tested persuasiveness of identical ads with varying gender/race portrayals, and experimented with country-specific ad targeting techniques.

Result: The research revealed demographic biases in AI-generated ads across different topics and showed that identical ads with different gender/race portrayals have disparate levels of persuasiveness as judged by models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual representations are task-agnostic when frozen during policy learning, and naive textual conditioning fails in control tasks due to domain gaps between diffusion training data and robotic environments.

Method: Proposes ORCA with learnable task prompts that adapt to control environments and visual prompts that capture frame-specific details, enabling task-adaptive representations from pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Task-adaptive visual representations from pre-trained diffusion models can be effectively obtained through specialized conditioning strategies that address the specific visual requirements of control tasks.

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Result: Real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to 424×800 at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: DriveGen3D successfully addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction, enabling highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scene generation.

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D

Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to

TL;DR: The paper evaluates MRI brain tumor inpainting methods, finds performance saturation in existing models, and proposes an ensemble approach with post-processing and U-Net refinement to improve anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI analysis tools optimized for healthy anatomies often fail with large lesions like tumors, so inpainting techniques are needed to synthesize healthy tissues in tumor regions to enable reliable application of general-purpose tools.

Method: Combines model ensembling with post-processing strategies (median filtering, histogram matching, pixel averaging) and a lightweight U-Net enhancement stage for anatomical refinement.

Result: The proposed pipeline improves anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions, yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline models.

Conclusion: By combining established models with targeted post-processing, the approach achieves improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable research.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

TL;DR: QCFace introduces a hard margin strategy to decouple recognizability from identity representation in face recognition, overcoming gradient overlap issues and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition methods inadequately capture recognizability through soft margin constraints, leading to weak quality representation and discrimination, especially for low-quality faces. Mutual overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude cause optimization instability and poor generalization.

Method: Proposed Quality Control Face (QCFace) with a hard margin strategy that decouples recognizability from identity representation. Uses a novel hard-margin-based loss function with guidance factor for hypersphere planning to simultaneously optimize recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show QCFace provides robust and quantifiable recognizability encoding while achieving state-of-the-art performance in both verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing recognizability-based losses.

Conclusion: The hard margin strategy in QCFace effectively addresses mutual overlapping gradient problems, enables clear decoupling of recognizability from identity, and improves face recognition performance across various quality levels.

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

### [29] [Hyperbolic Structured Classification for Robust Single Positive Multi-label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15296)
*Yiming Lin,Shang Wang,Junkai Zhou,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperbolic classification framework for Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) that represents labels as hyperbolic balls to capture hierarchical, co-occurrence, and independence relationships through geometric interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in existing SPMLL methods that implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity without explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types.

Method: Uses hyperbolic ball representations for labels, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through geometric interactions (inclusion, overlap, separation). Introduces temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and physics-inspired double-well regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision, with learned embeddings showing strong correlation with real-world co-occurrence patterns.

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

*Minglei Shi,Haolin Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Ziyang Yuan,Xiaoshi Wu,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVG introduces a novel latent diffusion model that replaces VAEs with self-supervised DINO features, enabling more efficient training, faster inference, and better transferability to vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAE+diffusion models suffer from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability due to VAE latent spaces lacking clear semantic separation and discriminative structure.

Method: SVG constructs a semantically structured latent space using frozen DINO features for clear semantic discriminability, with a lightweight residual branch for fine-grained details. Diffusion models are trained directly on this space.

Result: SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, improves generative quality, and preserves semantic and discriminative capabilities of self-supervised representations.

Conclusion: SVG provides a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations by leveraging semantically structured latent spaces without VAEs.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

### [31] [Layer as Puzzle Pieces: Compressing Large Language Models through Layer Concatenation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15304)
*Fei Wang,Li Shen,Liang Ding,Chao Xue,Ye Liu,Changxing Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMe is a progressive layer pruning framework that addresses limitations in structured pruning of LLMs by using concatenation-based merging and hierarchical distillation to maintain model capabilities while reducing size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured pruning methods for LLMs cause performance degradation by directly removing layers, use incompetent weight aggregation, and lack effective post-training recovery mechanisms.

Method: Proposes CoMe with: 1) channel sensitivity metric using activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel selection, 2) concatenation-based layer merging to fuse critical channels across adjacent layers, 3) hierarchical distillation leveraging layer correspondences for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model retains 83% of its original average accuracy across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMe effectively addresses key limitations in structured pruning and enables significant model size reduction while maintaining high performance through progressive pruning and hierarchical knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

### [32] [Proto-Former: Unified Facial Landmark Detection by Prototype Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15338)
*Shengkai Hu,Haozhe Qi,Jun Wan,Jiaxing Huang,Lefei Zhang,Hang Sun,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-Former is a unified facial landmark detection framework that enables joint training across multiple datasets with different landmark definitions, overcoming single-dataset limitations through prototype-based feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial landmark detection methods are limited to single-dataset training due to varying landmark definitions across datasets, which restricts model generalization and prevents unified model development.

Method: Proto-Former uses an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) for feature extraction and prototype learning, a Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) for prototype refinement and attention guidance, and a Prototype-Aware (PA) loss for stable multi-dataset training.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show Proto-Former achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effective multi-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Proto-Former successfully addresses the multi-dataset facial landmark detection challenge through prototype-based representation learning, enabling unified training and improved generalization across datasets with different landmark definitions.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Xingrui Wang,Wufei Ma,Tiezheng Zhang,Celso M de Melo,Jieneng Chen,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial457 is a synthetic dataset for evaluating 6D spatial reasoning in large multimodal models, revealing performance declines in complex 3D tasks and identifying prediction biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on 2D spatial understanding and lack comprehensive evaluation of 6D spatial reasoning capabilities in large multimodal models.

Method: Created Spatial457 dataset with 4 spatial reasoning capabilities and cascading evaluation structure across 7 question types and 5 difficulty levels, introducing Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR) metric.

Result: Models show performance decline as task complexity increases, especially in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks, with consistent prediction biases across attributes.

Conclusion: Current LMMs struggle with complex 3D spatial reasoning, highlighting the need for improved spatial understanding capabilities and the value of unbiased evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

*Joshua Li,Brendan Chharawala,Chang Shu,Xue Bin Peng,Pengcheng Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHARE is a method that uses scene geometry to accurately ground 3D human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB video, improving human placement in 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human motion reconstruction methods struggle with accurately placing humans in 3D space, which is important for realistic character interactions in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics.

Method: SHARE estimates human mesh and segmentation masks for every frame, extracts scene point maps at keyframes, then iteratively refines human positions by comparing human mesh against human point maps while preserving relative root joint positions between keyframes and non-keyframes.

Result: SHARE enables more accurate 3D human placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, working on both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos, and outperforms existing methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SHARE successfully leverages scene geometry to improve 3D human motion reconstruction accuracy from monocular video, providing better grounding of humans in their environment.

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cortical-SSM is a novel deep state space model architecture that captures integrated dependencies across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains for EEG/ECoG motor imagery classification, outperforming baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and ECoG signals for motor imagery classification have application potential for communication assistance and rehabilitation, but face challenges from physiological artifacts and limitations of existing Transformer-based approaches in capturing fine-grained dependencies.

Method: Proposed Cortical-SSM architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains of EEG/ECoG signals.

Result: Outperformed baseline methods on three benchmarks: two large-scale public MI EEG datasets (>50 subjects) and a clinical MI ECoG dataset from an ALS patient. Visual explanations showed effective capture of neurophysiologically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance in EEG/ECoG motor imagery classification while capturing neurophysiologically meaningful patterns.

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel staged adaptive fine-tuning approach for surgical tool detection that uses linear probing and gradual freezing to improve efficiency and performance, achieving 96.4% mAP on Cholec80 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated data in surgical settings poses challenges for training robust deep learning models for automated surgical tool detection in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Two-step approach: linear probing stage to condition classification layers on pre-trained CNN, and gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce fine-tunable layers. Uses ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 pre-trained on ImageNet.

Result: Achieved 96.4% mean average precision on Cholec80 dataset, outperforming existing approaches. Method also validated on CATARACTS dataset showing broader applicability.

Conclusion: Gradual freezing fine-tuning is promising for improving tool detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader applications in general image classification.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

### [37] [FreqPDE: Rethinking Positional Depth Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15385)
*Haisheng Su,Junjie Zhang,Feixiang Song,Sanping Zhou,Wei Wu,Nanning Zheng,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FreqPDE, a frequency-aware positional depth embedding method that enhances 3D object detection from multi-view 2D images by improving depth prediction quality and addressing cross-view consistency and scale invariance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D object detection from 2D images rely on depth prediction with LiDAR supervision, but suffer from poor depth quality (discontinuous boundaries, indistinct small objects) due to sparse supervision and high-level features. Cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked.

Method: FreqPDE consists of three modules: Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (combines high-frequency edges and low-frequency semantics), Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (estimates pixel-level depth with attention), and Positional Depth Encoder (combines 2D features with 3D position embeddings). Uses hybrid depth supervision for complementary learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness and superiority over previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed FreqPDE method successfully addresses depth prediction quality issues and improves 3D object detection performance by incorporating frequency-aware features, cross-view consistency, and scale invariance.

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

*Ting-Yu Yen,Yu-Sheng Chiu,Shih-Hsuan Hung,Peter Wonka,Hung-Kuo Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFGS is a pose-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs complete 3D objects by fusing multi-pose image captures, overcoming limitations of single-pose methods that miss occluded regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods assume static single poses, leading to incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. There's a need for practical solutions that can reconstruct complete objects from multi-pose captures.

Method: PFGS iteratively fuses auxiliary pose images into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose using pose-aware fusion strategy with global and local registration. It leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and foundation models for cross-pose registration.

Result: PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: PFGS effectively addresses the challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose captures by intelligently incorporating foundation models into the registration process, resolving background inconsistency issues and achieving superior reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

*Peng Ren,Hai Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LILAC extends offline VAE-Diffusion motion stylization to real-time streaming by using a latent-space architecture with causal decoding and feature injection for smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming motion generation approaches have computational overhead and temporal stability issues, while high-quality VAE-Diffusion methods are limited to offline processing.

Method: Builds on offline VAE-Diffusion framework with latent-space streaming architecture using sliding-window causal design and decoded motion feature injection for smooth transitions.

Result: Enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary motion stylization without future frames or diffusion model modifications, achieving good balance between quality and responsiveness.

Conclusion: LILAC successfully bridges the gap between offline quality and real-time requirements for motion stylization through streaming VAE-Diffusion with causal decoding.

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

*Bingyu Li,Feiyu Wang,Da Zhang,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARIS, the first large-scale benchmark for underwater open-vocabulary instance segmentation, and proposes a unified framework with geometric prior enhancement and semantic alignment mechanisms to address visual degradation and semantic misalignment issues in underwater scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are limited to close-vocabulary prediction and cannot recognize novel marine categories. Transferring open-vocabulary segmentation from natural images to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (color attenuation) and semantic misalignment due to lack of underwater class definitions.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with two components: 1) Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (GPEM) that leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions, and 2) Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (SAIM) that enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors to mitigate semantic ambiguity.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines in both In-Domain and Cross-Domain settings on the MARIS benchmark, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of underwater open-vocabulary instance segmentation by combining geometric prior enhancement with semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and enabling recognition of novel marine categories.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

TL;DR: LoSP-Prompt is a reconstruction framework for multi-shot DWI that uses physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning to overcome motion artifacts, achieving twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI with excellent performance across multiple anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of multi-shot DWI for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration and peristalsis, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities.

Method: Models inter-shot phase variations as high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP) integrated into low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction, with automatic rank parameter setting via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion.

Result: Validated on 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers): achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhanced liver lesion conspicuity, generalized to seven anatomical regions with single model, outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality and artifact suppression (4-5 points on kidney DWI, 4 points on liver/sacroiliac/spinal cord, 3-4 points on knee/tumor brain).

Conclusion: Eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI with scanner-agnostic performance that signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

*Shuang Liang,Zhihao Xu,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning to Detect (LoD) is a general framework that detects unknown jailbreak attacks in Large Vision-Language Models by shifting from attack-specific to task-specific learning, achieving higher detection accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak detection methods either lack generalization to unseen attacks or have limited accuracy and efficiency, posing safety risks for Large Vision-Language Models.

Method: Proposes LoD framework with Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector for safety-oriented representation learning and Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder for unsupervised attack classification.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency.

Conclusion: LoD provides an effective solution for detecting unknown jailbreak attacks in LVLMs by focusing on task-specific learning rather than attack-specific parameters.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety is a framework that uses zero-shot semantic segmentation on street-view imagery to create 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, combines them with road type data, and applies machine learning and causal inference methods to analyze accident patterns in Austin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key challenges in using street-view imagery for traffic risk analysis: (1) constructing street-level indicators that capture accident-related features, and (2) quantifying their causal impacts across different accident types.

Method: Applied zero-shot semantic segmentation to street-view imagery to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, integrated road type as contextual information, trained XGBoost multi-class classifier with SHAP for feature interpretation, and used Generalized Propensity Score weighting with Average Treatment Effect estimation for causal inference.

Result: Uncovered heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry features dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, while excessive visual openness increases risk.

Conclusion: Semantic4Safety bridges predictive modeling with causal inference, supporting targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

*Feifei Zhang,Zhenhong Jia,Sensen Song,Fei Shi,Dayong Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCMambaNet introduces a Predictive-Corrective paradigm that accelerates learning by decoupling modeling tasks, achieving state-of-the-art brain MRI segmentation accuracy in only 1-5 epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large datasets, limiting efficiency in data-scarce domains like medical imaging.

Method: Uses two synergistic modules: Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates coarse approximations using anatomical knowledge (bilateral symmetry) to create focus maps, and Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns residual errors to refine challenging regions and pathological boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation while converging within only 1-5 epochs, significantly outperforming conventional end-to-end models.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify learning objectives effectively mitigates data inefficiency and overfitting, enabling dramatic acceleration in convergence.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EARL, an evidence-aware reinforcement learning framework for Video LLMs that dynamically selects key frames and performs localized re-sampling to improve long-form video reasoning by prioritizing evidence purity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static uniform frame sampling in Video LLMs leads to information dilution and obscures critical evidence, while existing pixel-space video reasoning agents lack rigorous reward mechanisms for evidence purity and cannot perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames.

Method: Evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework that transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence, dynamically selecting the most relevant frames and performing localized re-sampling around key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source Video LLMs: 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench, and 64.9% on VideoMME with a 7B model.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of dynamic frame selection with localized re-sampling for improved long-form video reasoning.

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

*Nengbo Zhang,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net is a multi-view learning framework that combines RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks to improve Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based recognition models using only RGB data often fail to capture complex spatial-temporal characteristics of MAV motion, limiting their ability to distinguish different actions in autonomous aerial swarms.

Method: Proposes MAVR-Net with three complementary data types: RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks. Uses ResNet-based encoders, multi-scale feature pyramid, cross-view attention module, and multi-view alignment loss for robust feature extraction and cross-view interaction.

Result: Achieved 97.8%, 96.5%, and 92.8% accuracy on Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets respectively, clearly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-view learning approach combining multiple data modalities significantly improves MAV motion recognition performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-view attention and multi-view alignment for capturing complex spatial-temporal motion patterns.

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

*Zhiqiang Zhu,Xinbo Gao,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Zhaoyang Wang,Mingqian Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack is a prompt-based aerial tracker for nighttime scenarios that encodes object attribute features into directional kernels with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts, overcoming limitations of existing trackers that rely solely on spatial localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely only on spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues for target features and produces vague prompts, impairing tracking accuracy in nighttime scenarios.

Method: DPTrack hierarchically captures object's topological structure using visual bionics, encodes topology-aware features into directional kernels, and uses a kernel-guided prompt module with channel-category correspondence to propagate kernels across search regions and generate precise prompts with spatial gating.

Result: Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate DPTrack's superior performance compared to existing nighttime aerial trackers.

Conclusion: DPTrack effectively addresses the limitations of vague prompts in nighttime aerial tracking by encoding fine-grained attribute cues into directional kernels, enabling more accurate target feature localization and robust nighttime tracking performance.

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at

### [48] [Improving Micro-Expression Recognition with Phase-Aware Temporal Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15466)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method that decomposes micro-expression sequences into onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases, generating separate dynamic images for each phase to improve micro-expression recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is limited by scarce annotated datasets and existing methods rely on simple spatial augmentations while overlooking temporal augmentation strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics.

Method: Proposes a dual-phase dynamic image augmentation strategy that decomposes each expression sequence into onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases, generating separate dynamic images for each phase to enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal cues.

Result: Experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures show consistent improvements in recognition accuracy, F1-score, and recall. When combined with spatial augmentations, achieves up to 10% relative improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed phase-aware temporal augmentation is simple, model-agnostic, effective in low-resource settings, and offers a promising direction for robust and generalizable micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SfM methods struggle with driving scenes from multi-camera systems due to unreliable pose estimation, excessive road surface outliers, and low reconstruction efficiency.

Method: Leverages fixed spatial relationships in multi-camera systems for reliable pose estimation, uses plane model to remove erroneous road surface points, treats multi-camera set as single unit in Bundle Adjustment, and employs coarse-to-fine scene association and assembly modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.124 absolute pose error on nuScenes dataset, validated across various real-world driving scenes and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: MRASfM effectively addresses the unique challenges of multi-camera SfM in driving scenes, providing robust and efficient reconstruction with superior pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: ClapperText provides a realistic, culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts, with dataset and evaluation code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated

1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM) for drone video-text retrieval, addressing unique challenges of drone videos like overhead perspectives and structural homogeneity through adaptive semantic learning and cross-modal feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone videos present unique challenges for cross-modal retrieval due to overhead perspectives, structural homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions that existing ground-level methods cannot effectively handle, requiring specialized retrieval mechanisms.

Method: MSAM uses multi-semantic adaptive learning with dynamic frame changes, adaptive semantic construction, distribution-driven learning, diversity terms, and cross-modal interactive feature fusion pooling to minimize background noise and enhance target region feature matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on self-constructed drone video-text datasets demonstrate that MSAM outperforms existing methods in drone video-text retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: MSAM provides an effective solution for drone video-text retrieval by addressing unique drone video characteristics through specialized semantic mining and cross-modal interaction mechanisms.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for computationally efficient deep learning models for scientific applications, addressing unpaired dataset challenges in microscopy modality transfer.

Method: Modified U-Net generator with fixed channels instead of channel-doubling, reducing parameters from 41.8M to ~9K while maintaining CycleGAN framework for unpaired image translation.

Result: Drastic parameter reduction (99.98%) with superior performance, faster training, lower memory usage, and successful application as diagnostic tool for detecting imaging artifacts and labeling errors.

Conclusion: Lightweight CycleGAN enables efficient modality transfer in microscopy while serving as practical diagnostic tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity.

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: Most existing MER methods using optical flow focus only on the onset-to-apex phase, missing the important temporal dynamics in the apex-to-offset phase which contains key motion information.

Method: Proposed Combined Optical Flow (COF) that integrates both onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases to provide comprehensive motion analysis for micro-expression feature representation.

Result: Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating improved performance in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Conclusion: Integrating both onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases through COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis and enhances micro-expression recognition performance.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on

multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of
3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as
accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust
benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset
along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for
accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing
real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide
baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and
suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of
the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to
advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.

*Andre Rochow,Jonas Marcic,Svetlana Seliunina,Sven Behnke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of agricultural plants using autonomous UAV image capture and iterative motion correction to handle wind and downwash effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D phenotyping of plants is crucial for understanding plant growth, yield prediction, and disease control, but existing methods struggle with environmental challenges like wind and UAV downwash.

Method: Uses autonomous UAV image capture with ArUco markers, integrates state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods, and employs iterative motion correction using optical flow between original images and intermediate 3D reconstructions to gradually reduce scene motion.

Result: The pipeline improves reconstruction quality of state-of-the-art methods and enables extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes after a few iterations, successfully mitigating errors caused by leaf motion during capture.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for 3D plant phenotyping under challenging environmental conditions, with plans to publicly release source code and provide a dataset of multiple crops captured over time.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

*Gerard Comas-Quiles,Carles Garcia-Cabrera,Julia Dietlmeier,Noel E. O'Connor,Ferran Marques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MViT-AE, a multimodal vision transformer autoencoder for unsupervised brain tumor detection in MRI using only healthy data, achieving clinically meaningful localization without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitations of supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent, providing a scalable alternative for neuroimaging workflows.

Method: Uses a multimodal vision transformer autoencoder trained on healthy brain MRIs with early-late fusion strategy across MRI sequences, plus SAM-based post-processing to refine tumor contours via reconstruction error maps.

Result: Achieved lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on test set, and 89.4% anomaly detection rate on validation set.

Conclusion: Transformer-based unsupervised models show potential as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging, despite challenges in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

*Xianmin Chen,Peiliang Huang,Longfei Han,Dingwen Zhang,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMA is a hierarchical architecture combining Transformer and Mamba modules for efficient low-light RAW image enhancement, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for low-light RAW image enhancement struggle to simultaneously achieve strong enhancement quality and high efficiency, suffering from inherent limitations.

Method: Proposes HiMA with three key components: 1) Hierarchical Mixing Architecture using Transformer for large-scale features and Mamba for small-scale features, 2) Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA) for handling uneven illumination, and 3) Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module integrating spatial and frequency-domain priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with superior performance using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HiMA provides an efficient and effective solution for low-light RAW image enhancement by leveraging complementary strengths of different modules and addressing local illumination variations through adaptive distribution alignment.

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

### [58] [DGME-T: Directional Grid Motion Encoding for Transformer-Based Historical Camera Movement Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15725)
*Tingyu Lin,Armin Dadras,Florian Kleber,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGME-T enhances Video Swin Transformer with directional grid motion encoding from optical flow, improving camera movement classification accuracy on both modern and archival film footage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera movement classification models trained on modern footage perform poorly on archival films due to noise, missing frames, and low contrast that obscure motion cues.

Method: Introduces DGME-T, a lightweight extension to Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding derived from optical flow via a learnable normalized late-fusion layer.

Result: DGME-T improves top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, and from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1 on WWII footage.

Conclusion: Structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary, and even small, carefully calibrated motion heads can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

### [59] [NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752)
*Yitong Sun,Yao Huang,Ruochen Zhang,Huanran Chen,Shouwei Ruan,Ranjie Duan,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NDM is a noise-driven framework that detects and mitigates implicit sexual content in text-to-image generation while preserving model quality, using noise-based detection and adaptive negative guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are vulnerable to generating inappropriate content from implicit sexual prompts that bypass existing detection methods, creating ethical concerns without compromising generative quality.

Method: Proposes NDM framework with two innovations: 1) noise-based detection using early-stage predicted noise separability, and 2) noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance that optimizes initial noise by suppressing prominent regions' attention.

Result: NDM achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods (SLD, UCE, RECE) on both natural and adversarial datasets, effectively detecting and mitigating implicit malicious content.

Conclusion: NDM provides an effective solution for detecting and mitigating implicit sexual content in T2I models while maintaining generative capabilities, addressing a critical ethical vulnerability in current systems.

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and

### [60] [Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520)
*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFA is an attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify biased subpopulations in face recognition models, outperforming traditional clustering methods in semantic coherence and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern face recognition models have systematic biases affecting certain subpopulations, but conventional bias evaluation requires expensive labeled attributes and is limited to predefined categories.

Method: Latent Feature Alignment (LFA) uses latent directions to identify subpopulations, enabling semantically coherent grouping and discovery of interpretable directions corresponding to attributes like age, ethnicity, or attire.

Result: Across four state-of-the-art recognition models and two benchmarks, LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in intra-group semantic coherence while uncovering interpretable latent directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes.

Conclusion: LFA provides a practical method for representation auditing of face recognition models, enabling identification and interpretation of biased subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

### [61] [Semantic segmentation with coarse annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15756)
*Jort de Jong,Mike Holenderski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a regularization method using SLIC superpixels to improve semantic segmentation with coarse annotations, particularly enhancing boundary alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine pixel-level annotations for semantic segmentation are expensive and difficult to obtain, while coarse annotations are more accessible but lead to poor boundary alignment in segmentation models.

Method: Uses SLIC superpixels based on color and position as regularization in encoder-decoder architectures with superpixel upsampling, applied to FCN-16 network.

Result: Significant improvement in boundary recall on SUIM, Cityscapes, and PanNuke datasets compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed superpixel-based regularization effectively addresses boundary alignment issues in semantic segmentation with coarse annotations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Custom CNN architectures for satellite land use classification achieve 97.23% accuracy on EuroSAT dataset without pre-trained models, using a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism combining spatial and spectral feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop specialized convolutional neural network architectures specifically for satellite imagery classification that don't rely on pre-trained models, addressing unique challenges in satellite data processing.

Method: Three progressive architectural iterations: baseline CNN, CBAM-enhanced, and balanced multi-task attention mechanism combining Coordinate Attention for spatial features and Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral features with learnable fusion parameter. Used progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20%) and class-balanced loss weighting.

Result: Achieved 97.23% test accuracy on EuroSAT dataset, Cohen's Kappa of 0.9692, with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy. The learnable fusion parameter converged to alpha ≈ 0.57, indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities. Performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned ResNet-50.

Conclusion: Systematic architectural design can achieve competitive performance for domain-specific applications without external data or pre-trained models, with balanced attention to both spatial and spectral features being crucial for satellite imagery classification.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: A system that enables interactive understanding and control of generative models by allowing users to replace activation functions with parametric ones and adjust their parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in image generative models, there's a lack of tools for direct, interpretable interaction with their internal mechanisms to help users better understand and control model behavior.

Method: Developed a system that allows users to replace activation functions in generative networks with parametric functions and set their parameters, providing alternative control over network outputs. Demonstrated on StyleGAN2 (FFHQ) and BigGAN (ImageNet).

Result: The system enables users to interactively experiment with and control generative model outputs through parametric activation function manipulation.

Conclusion: This approach offers an interpretable way for users to understand and control generative models through direct interaction with internal network components.

Abstract: As image generative models continue to increase not only in their fidelity
but also in their ubiquity the development of tools that leverage direct

little attention In this work we introduce a system that allows users to
develop a better understanding of the model through interaction and
experimentation By giving users the ability to replace activation functions of
a generative network with parametric ones and a way to set the parameters of
these functions we introduce an alternative approach to control the networks

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM2P is a 3D diffusion bridge framework that generates simulated FDG-PET images from MRI and basic patient data, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy for dementia from 75.0% to 84.7% in clinical trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET is valuable for dementia diagnosis but is less accessible and more expensive than MRI. The goal is to make PET's diagnostic benefits more widely available by simulating it from routinely available MRI.

Method: A 3D diffusion bridge framework that learns probabilistic mapping from MRI and patient demographics to generate diagnostic-quality FDG-PET simulations. The system requires only 20 site-specific cases and basic demographic information for local deployment.

Result: In blinded clinical studies, SiM2P improved overall diagnostic accuracy for differentiating Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy controls from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Simulated PET received higher diagnostic certainty and better interrater agreement than MRI alone.

Conclusion: SiM2P makes FDG-PET's established diagnostic benefits more accessible, potentially improving early dementia detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited settings where PET is unavailable or too expensive.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Conclusion: Modalities reinforce each other in perception and reasoning, and the approach demonstrates practical advantages in robotics, medical AI, and smart factory applications.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,

TL;DR: A vision-guided 3D layout generation system that uses image generation models and robust image parsing to create coherent 3D scene layouts, outperforming existing methods in richness and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization-based methods are constrained by manual rules, deep generative models struggle with richness and diversity, and LLM-based approaches lack robustness in capturing complex spatial relationships.

Method: 1) Construct a high-quality asset library with 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D layouts; 2) Fine-tune image generation model to expand prompts into images aligned with asset library; 3) Develop robust image parsing module to recover 3D layouts from visual semantics and geometry; 4) Optimize layouts using scene graphs and visual semantics for logical coherence.

Result: Extensive user testing shows the algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in layout richness and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-guided approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and produces high-quality 3D scene layouts with improved coherence and diversity.

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-view architecture with specialized encoders for DeepFake detection that handles pose variations and artifacts better than single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DeepFake detection methods struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts in real-world conditions, requiring more robust approaches.

Method: Uses four specialized encoders: global view for boundary inconsistencies, middle view for texture/color alignment, local view for distortions in facial regions (eyes, nose, mouth), and face orientation for pose classification. Features from these encoders are fused for detection.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance over conventional single-view approaches, achieving robust detection under challenging pose and lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The multi-view architecture effectively enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing facial features at multiple levels, providing better handling of real-world challenges like pose variations and artifacts.

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the

*Harkaitz Goyena,Peter M. Atkinson,Unai Pérez-Goya,M. Dolores Ugarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two standardization approaches for Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods: traditional upscaling and a sharpening method called ABSIS that blends fine-resolution image features with coarse-resolution attributes to improve fusion accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate the application of STIF methods by addressing the requirement for images with matching spatial and spectral resolutions from different sensors.

Method: Two standardization approaches: 1) Traditional upscaling of fine-resolution images, and 2) ABSIS sharpening method that blends overall features from fine-resolution image series with distinctive attributes of specific coarse-resolution images.

Result: Both methods significantly increased accuracy of the USTFIP STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing spectral accuracy by up to 49.46% and spatial accuracy by up to 78.40%.

Conclusion: The proposed standardization approaches, particularly the ABSIS sharpening method, significantly improve STIF method accuracy by better preparing input images for fusion processes.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Method: Proposes FlexiReID with adaptive mixture-of-experts mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality features and cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature extraction. Also constructs CIRS-PEDES dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex scenarios across the seven supported retrieval modes.

Conclusion: FlexiReID provides a comprehensive solution for flexible multimodal person re-identification that supports arbitrary query-retrieval combinations across multiple modalities, enabling practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

*Andrei-Timotei Ardelean,Patrick Rückbeil,Tim Weyrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QFCA is a real-time method for zero-shot anomaly localization in textures that achieves 10x speedup through quantization of feature correspondence analysis while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly localization methods have high running times that make them impractical for real-world applications like assembly line monitoring.

Method: Proposes QFCA - a quantized version of feature correspondence analysis that compares patch statistics using histograms of quantized values, plus PCA-based feature preprocessing to enhance contrast between normal and anomalous features.

Result: Achieves 10x speedup with little to no loss in accuracy, and improves detection precision on complex textures through the PCA preprocessing step.

Conclusion: QFCA provides a practical real-time solution for texture anomaly localization that outperforms prior methods in speed while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

*Tomáš Chobola,Julia A. Schnabel,Tingying Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise2Detail (N2D) is an ultra-lightweight self-supervised denoising model that achieves fast inference and high-quality image restoration without requiring clean training data, using a multistage pipeline that disrupts noise correlations and recaptures details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods face computational and memory constraints, forcing trade-offs between inference speed and reconstruction quality, especially problematic for biomedical imaging where clean training data is scarce.

Method: Built on Noise2Noise framework, introduces multistage denoising pipeline that disrupts spatial noise correlations to create intermediate smooth structures, then refines them to recapture fine details directly from noisy input without clean references or explicit noise modeling.

Result: Extensive testing shows Noise2Detail outperforms existing dataset-free techniques while requiring only a fraction of computational resources, achieving both fast denoising and high-quality image restoration.

Conclusion: The combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach makes Noise2Detail particularly valuable for biomedical imaging applications where clean training data is scarce and fast inference is essential for practical use.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work

### [73] [Uncertainty-Aware Extreme Point Tracing for Weakly Supervised Ultrasound Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15666)
*Lei Shi,Gang Li,Junxing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised medical image segmentation method that uses only four extreme points as annotation, leveraging SAM2 for initial pseudo labels and refining them with uncertainty-aware techniques to achieve performance comparable to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high annotation cost of fully supervised medical image segmentation by developing a weakly supervised approach that requires only minimal annotations (four extreme points) while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Uses bounding boxes from extreme points as SAM2 prompts to generate initial pseudo labels, then refines them with enhanced FGEPM algorithm with Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty, dual-branch USC loss, and box alignment loss for spatial consistency and boundary precision.

Result: Extensive experiments on BUSI and UNS ultrasound datasets show the method achieves performance comparable to and even surpassing fully supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised framework is effective and practical for ultrasound image segmentation, offering a viable alternative to costly fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMedVL is a unified multimodal medical AI framework that simultaneously handles both medical image understanding (interpretation) and generation (synthesis) tasks within a single architecture, addressing the current gap where existing systems separate these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI systems disrupt the unified diagnostic process by separating image understanding (interpretation) from image generation (synthesis), creating gaps in data representation, feature integration, and multimodal capabilities.

Method: Proposed a multi-level framework using the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm: 1) Created UniMed-5M dataset with 5.6M samples for multimodal observation, 2) Progressive Curriculum Learning for systematic medical knowledge introduction, 3) UniMedVL model architecture for unified multimodal analysis.

Result: UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks and matches specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. The unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing where generation tasks enhance visual understanding features.

Conclusion: Integrating traditionally separate medical AI capabilities (understanding and generation) within a single framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks, demonstrating that unified multimodal approaches can overcome limitations of specialized systems.

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: Ditto is a framework that generates 1M high-quality video editing training examples using an efficient pipeline combining image editing, video generation, and AI agents, enabling state-of-the-art instruction-based video editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-based video editing is limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data, which hampers progress in democratizing content creation.

Method: Ditto uses a data generation pipeline that fuses image editing diversity with in-context video generation, employs efficient distilled model architecture with temporal enhancer, and uses intelligent agents for instruction crafting and quality filtering.

Result: Created Ditto-1M dataset with 1 million high-fidelity video editing examples using over 12,000 GPU-days, and trained Editto model that achieves superior instruction-following ability.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing by solving the fundamental data scarcity problem through scalable, high-quality data generation.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGA introduces a stepwise evolution paradigm for content-aware layout generation, using a hierarchical reasoning framework with coarse-to-fine strategy and incorporating layout design principles to improve layout planning for complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for content-aware layout generation use single-step reasoning frameworks that lack feedback-based self-correction mechanisms, leading to high failure rates when dealing with complex element layout planning.

Method: SEGA employs a hierarchical reasoning framework with coarse-to-fine strategy: a coarse-level module estimates layout planning results, then a refining module performs fine-level reasoning. It also incorporates layout design principles as prior knowledge and introduces GenPoster-100K, a new large-scale poster dataset with rich meta-information annotation.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SEGA by achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SEGA's stepwise evolution paradigm with hierarchical reasoning and layout design principles significantly improves content-aware layout generation performance, particularly for complex layout planning scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Motivation: To address issues with high-frequency fidelity and rare activation spikes in latent diffusion models, particularly at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Method: Combines per-sample micro clamping to gently limit extreme values without washing out texture, and Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip) that adapts allowed value corridors per region using either local structure statistics or attention entropy guidance.

Result: Yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead, shows consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones, and enables synergy with CFG/Rescale for higher guidance without artifacts.

Conclusion: QSilk provides an effective stabilization solution for latent diffusion models that improves output quality while maintaining efficiency and requiring no additional training, making it suitable for integration into existing rendering pipelines.

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Result: Experiments on three diverse datasets show LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy, outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification performance.

Conclusion: By grounding concepts in visual evidence, LDCBM overcomes fundamental limitations of prior models and enhances the reliability of interpretable AI.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited

TL;DR: ReCon is a novel data augmentation framework that enhances structure-controllable generative models for object detection by integrating region-guided rectification and region-aligned cross-attention during diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale annotated datasets are costly and time-consuming to obtain, while current generative approaches for data augmentation suffer from content-position mismatches, semantic leakage, and require complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning.

Method: ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into diffusion sampling using feedback from pre-trained perception models, and proposes region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and textual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReCon substantially improves the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

Conclusion: ReCon effectively overcomes limitations of current generative approaches by improving semantic consistency and image fidelity through its novel integration of perception feedback and spatial-semantic alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERNet is an efficient feed-forward model for non-rigid point cloud registration that uses a two-stage pipeline to predict deformation graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 4x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in non-rigid point cloud registration including local minima due to non-convex objectives and error accumulation over long sequences, especially under noisy or partial inputs.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, then refines their trajectories over time using sliding-window temporal information.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets, achieves more than 4x speedup compared to previous best methods.

Conclusion: ERNet provides an efficient, scalable data-driven solution for accurate and consistent sequential non-rigid registration that handles noisy/partial inputs effectively.

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA is a multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through iterative prompt refinement, achieving significant quality improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time optimization methods struggle with video generation's multi-faceted nature, and generated video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts.

Method: VISTA uses a multi-agent system that: 1) decomposes user ideas into structured temporal plans, 2) identifies best videos through pairwise tournaments, 3) critiques videos using specialized agents (visual, audio, contextual), and 4) synthesizes feedback to rewrite prompts iteratively.

Result: VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines, with human evaluators preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Conclusion: VISTA demonstrates that autonomous iterative refinement through multi-agent collaboration effectively addresses the challenges of video generation, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Method: RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations (e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>) and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using pseudo categories. Each pixel predicts both semantic and spatial pseudo categories simultaneously, with relational constraints enforced through fuzzy logic relaxation in a deep network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art average mIoU across four benchmark datasets, with particular advantages on images containing multiple categories. Only requires a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic spatial reasoning is effective for OVSS, validating that explicit spatial relational constraints can significantly improve segmentation accuracy, especially in complex multi-object scenes.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

### [83] [3DPR: Single Image 3D Portrait Relight using Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15846)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPR is an image-based relighting model that uses generative priors from multi-view OLAT images and a pre-trained generative head model to render novel, relit views of human heads from monocular portrait images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graphics approaches for relighting human heads from monocular images are underconstrained and limited by model assumptions. The paper aims to leverage rich priors from lightstage data and generative models to achieve more accurate relighting.

Method: Uses encoder-based inversion to embed input portraits into a generative head model's latent space, then applies a triplane-based reflectance network trained on lightstage OLAT data to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images for image-based relighting.

Result: 3DPR outperforms previous methods in preserving identity and capturing lighting effects like specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering, achieving physically accurate environmental relighting.

Conclusion: The combination of generative head model priors and lightstage-trained reflectance networks enables high-quality relighting from monocular portraits, with better identity preservation and lighting effect capture than previous approaches.

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-SAM is a training-free, human-prompt-free pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts for SAM2 using DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval from a small memory of prior cases, achieving superior tongue segmentation performance compared to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) analysis, but supervised models require large annotated datasets and SAM-family models remain prompt-driven, requiring manual input.

Method: The method uses dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval to automatically generate foreground/background point prompts from a small memory of prior cases, guiding SAM2 without manual clicks or model fine-tuning.

Result: On 600 expert-annotated images, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863, significantly outperforming FCN (0.8188) and detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839), with particularly strong performance under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Retrieval-to-prompt enables data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging, providing a practical solution for medical applications without requiring large annotated datasets or manual intervention.

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

TL;DR: BLIP3o-NEXT is a fully open-source foundation model that unifies text-to-image generation and image editing in a single architecture using an Autoregressive + Diffusion approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance through key insights on architecture scaling, reinforcement learning, data quality, and enhanced instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the frontier of native image generation by creating a unified model that combines text-to-image generation and image editing capabilities, addressing the challenges of image editing while leveraging the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion models.

Method: Uses an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture where an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens from multimodal inputs, then uses these hidden states as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This combines autoregressive reasoning with diffusion's detail rendering.

Result: BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models on various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks, demonstrating strong image generation and editing capabilities with enhanced coherence and realism.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates text-to-image generation and image editing, with key findings that architecture efficiency, reinforcement learning, data quality, and post-training significantly impact performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in native image generation.

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Method: Uses an evolutionary framework with a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and adaptive optimizer to automatically generate diverse ensembles of interpretable natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods across multiple biomedical benchmarks, especially in data-scarce few-shot settings, with strong semantic alignment between discovered prompts and clinically significant features.

Conclusion: BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions through diverse interpretable prompts, representing a critical step toward more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent

interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a fully autonomous aerial construction system that can perform masonry work using multiple specialized UAVs working collaboratively.

Method: Developed two specialized UAVs: brick-carrier with ball-joint actuation for precise manipulation, and adhesion UAV with servo-controlled valve for accurate adhesion application. Uses reactive mission planning with dependency and conflict graphs, hierarchical state machines, dynamic task allocation, minimum-jerk trajectory generation, and onboard vision system with ArUco markers for real-time brick pose estimation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated fully autonomous aerial masonry construction where UAVs collaboratively place bricks and apply adhesion material. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness in precise brick manipulation and construction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in autonomous aerial robotic construction and serves as a foundation for future developments in this field.

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for precise robot manipulation rely on hard-to-obtain expert demonstrations and suffer from distribution shifts and low data efficiency in offline RL settings.

Method: A Role-Model Reinforcement Learning framework that unifies online and offline training, automatically generates labels using approximately optimal actions, reformulates policy learning as supervised training, and uses hybrid training with offline data reuse.

Result: RM-RL achieves 53% improvement in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy compared to existing methods, and successfully executes challenging tasks like precisely placing a cell plate onto a shelf.

Conclusion: RM-RL provides an effective solution for precise manipulation tasks by eliminating the need for human demonstrations and addressing key limitations of existing RL approaches through role-model strategies and hybrid training.

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods

Motivation: To develop a comprehensive dynamics framework for spacecraft-manipulator systems operating in orbital environments, capturing the coupling between spacecraft attitude, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics.

Method: Proposed Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE) combining Euler-Poincare equations for spacecraft, Keplerian orbital dynamics, and reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for manipulator shape space using exponential joint parametrization.

Result: Derived novel closed-form structural matrices capturing orbital disturbances and dynamic coupling effects, with systematic inclusion of externally applied wrenches for hardware-in-the-loop simulations.

Conclusion: The LPKE framework provides an effective model with numerical superiority for autonomous robotic operations in orbital environments, demonstrated through simulation of a 7-DOF manipulator on spacecraft.

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a

TL;DR: A robust LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system for legged robots that combines optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) to address estimation drift in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches for legged robots are still susceptible to estimation drift in complex and dynamic environments due to unsuitable fusion strategies, necessitating a more robust multi-sensor integration system.

Method: The system integrates camera, LiDAR, IMU, and joint encoders, employing two parallel approaches: VIKO uses footpreintegration and LiDAR-visual depth consistency with superpixel clusters in sliding window optimization; LIKO incorporates foot kinematics and point-to-plane residual in an error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF).

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates robust performance across public and long-term datasets compared to other sensor fusion-based SLAM algorithms.

Conclusion: The multi-sensor fusion system combining VIKO and LIKO provides a robust solution for legged robot navigation in complex environments, effectively addressing estimation drift issues through complementary optimization and filtering strategies.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across

TL;DR: PolyFly is an optimal global planner for aerial transportation robots that uses non-conservative polytope modeling of quadrotor, cable, and payload to enable aggressive flight through constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use geometric over-approximation of vehicles and obstacles, leading to conservative maneuvers and increased flight times in tightly constrained environments like dense forests and unsafe buildings.

Method: Models each physical component (quadrotor, cable, payload) and environment obstacles as independent polytopes, incorporates attitude via orientation-aware polytopes, and converts polytope constraints into smooth differentiable constraints using duality theory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in eight maze-like environments, producing faster trajectories in all scenarios. Experimental validation on a real quadrotor demonstrates practical reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: PolyFly enables more aggressive and efficient flight for aerial transportation robots by eliminating conservative geometric approximations through precise polytope modeling and optimal control formulation.

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel mathematical framework called Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem is developed to optimize mobile UAV station placement for disaster response, accounting for wind effects and UAV heterogeneity, reducing wasted operational time by up to 84%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters often destroy communication infrastructure, making it difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate them. UAVs can help collect data and establish temporary networks, but wind conditions pose significant challenges to their deployment.

Method: The authors generalize the Sylvester problem to create the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which incorporates wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth motion within a unified mathematical framework for determining optimal mobile UAV station locations.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed framework can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Conclusion: The SFT framework enhances the practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for real-world factors like wind and UAV heterogeneity, leading to more efficient and effective disaster response operations.

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a traversability-aware room segmentation method for 3D scene graphs that improves semantic coherence and computational efficiency in pose-graph optimization by considering robot-environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-time approaches have limitations in room segmentation - they either over-segment large rooms into non-functional spaces or under-segment complex non-traversable areas, leading to false constraints in pose-graph optimization.

Method: A traversability-aware room segmentation method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with consistent feasibility of traversability information.

Result: The method demonstrates improved performance through higher re-detection frequency of the same rooms in repeated traversals and reduced optimization time consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed traversability-aware approach enhances both semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization in 3D mapping systems.

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

*Gahee Kim,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ASBI is a framework that uses active robot data collection to tune black-box simulators by maximizing information gain through Neural Posterior Estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box simulators are hard to parameterize due to inaccessible likelihoods, and preparing informative observations for parameter estimation is difficult without knowing parameter-observation relationships.

Method: Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI) uses robots to collect real-world data online, optimizing actions to maximize information gain (expected reduction in Shannon entropy) via Neural Posterior Estimation to handle inaccessible likelihoods.

Result: Simulation experiments show accurate parameter estimation with posteriors sharply concentrated around true parameters. Real robot application successfully estimated simulation parameters for cubic particles representing beads and gravel using bucket pouring.

Conclusion: ASBI enables effective black-box simulator tuning through active data collection and information gain optimization, validated in both simulation and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

*Liviu-Mihai Stan,Ranulfo Bezerra,Shotaro Kojima,Tsige Tadesse Alemayoh,Satoshi Tadokoro,Masashi Konyo,Kazunori Ohno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive path-planning framework for robots that can recognize and push aside movable obstacles in unstructured indoor environments, integrated into ROS2 Nav2 stack with improved goal-reach rates and fewer deadlocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable navigation in disaster-response and unstructured indoor settings where robots need to not only avoid obstacles but also recognize when obstacles can be pushed aside, particularly for resource-constrained search and rescue robots.

Method: Uses LiDAR and odometry-based path planning with a Movable Obstacles Layer that labels LiDAR returns missing from static maps as tentatively movable with reduced traversal cost, and a Slow-Pose Progress Checker that monitors velocity ratios to adjust costs from light to heavy to lethal when robot slows or stalls.

Result: Gazebo evaluations on Scout Mini showed higher goal-reach rates and fewer deadlocks than baseline, with comparable traversal times in both isolated objects and cluttered corridors scenarios.

Conclusion: Interaction-aware cost maps provide a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings, suitable for resource-constrained platforms with minimal engineering integration.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

navigation and decision-making, such as avoiding undesirable regions. We
further showcase the ease of incorporating thousands of environments from
iPhone scans, large-scale scene datasets (e.g., GrandTour, ARKit), and outputs
from generative video models like Veo, enabling rapid creation of realistic

### [100] [Towards Automated Chicken Deboning via Learning-based Dynamically-Adaptive 6-DoF Multi-Material Cutting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15376)
*Zhaodong Yang,Ai-Ping Hu,Harish Ravichandar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for automated chicken shoulder deboning using reinforcement learning with force feedback to navigate complex joint anatomy while avoiding bone contact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating chicken deboning is challenging due to the need for precise 6-DoF cutting through partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joints while avoiding bone contact for health and safety reasons.

Method: Developed a simulator for multi-material cutting, created a physical testbed with rigid "bone" spheres in a softer block, and trained a residual RL policy with force feedback and domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer.

Result: The learned policy achieved up to 4x improvement over open-loop baselines in success rate and bone avoidance, and demonstrated zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to real chicken shoulders.

Conclusion: Force feedback is essential for safe and effective multi-material cutting, and the approach successfully enables automated chicken deboning with robust sim-to-real performance.

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

### [101] [VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446)
*Ziang Guo,Zufeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VDRive is an end-to-end autonomous driving pipeline that combines Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with diffusion policy for robust decision making, achieving state-of-the-art performance on driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments and corner cases challenge the robustness of autonomous vehicle state understanding and decision making, requiring more interpretable and reliable driving systems.

Method: Uses VLA with generative diffusion policy: contextual prediction via token generation with CVQ-VAE, geometric RL fine-tuning for trajectory prediction, and actor-critic framework for policy learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.

Conclusion: VDRive provides an effective end-to-end solution for autonomous driving that combines contextual and geometric reasoning through VLA and diffusion policy, demonstrating superior performance in challenging driving scenarios.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

### [102] [Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505)
*Aron Distelzweig,Faris Janjoš,Oliver Scheel,Sirish Reddy Varra,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Boedecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP) approaches in autonomous driving don't effectively utilize future predictions for better planning. Current methods struggle with proposal generation, and a proposal-centric approach focusing on diverse, realistic proposals outperforms existing methods, especially in interactive scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether tighter integration of prediction and planning in autonomous driving actually improves planning performance, and to understand why current IPP methods fail to exploit future behavior information effectively.

Method: Analysis using Val14 and interPlan benchmarks, revealing that perfect predictions don't improve planning. Developed enhanced proposal generation method based on PDM (lane-following approach), shifting focus to producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals for collision checking.

Result: Proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Many imitation learning-based planners perform worse than simple lane-following approaches.

Conclusion: The key to better autonomous driving planning lies in high-quality proposal generation rather than sophisticated prediction integration. A proposal-centric approach focusing on diverse, realistic proposals is more effective than current IPP methods.

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

### [103] [VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15530)
*Zehao Ni,Yonghao He,Lingfeng Qian,Jilei Mao,Fa Fu,Wei Sui,Hu Su,Junran Peng,Zhipeng Wang,Bin He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VO-DP is a vision-only diffusion policy method that uses pretrained visual foundation models to fuse semantic and geometric features, achieving performance comparable to point cloud methods in simulation and superior performance in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning approaches rely heavily on point clouds, but there's a lack of exploration of vision-only solutions which have significant potential for robotic manipulation.

Method: Uses pretrained visual foundation models (VGGT, DINOv2, Alternating Attention blocks) to fuse semantic and geometric features via cross-attention, then spatially compresses with CNN for policy input.

Result: In simulation: 64.6% success rate (vs DP3 64.0%, DP 34.8%); In real-world: 87.9% success rate (vs DP3 67.5%, DP 11.2%). Highly robust under varying conditions.

Conclusion: VO-DP demonstrates that vision-only approaches can achieve state-of-the-art performance in robotic manipulation, outperforming both vision-only and point cloud baselines, especially in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

*Shilei Li,Dawei Shi,Makoto Iwasaki,Yan Ning,Hongpeng Zhou,Ling Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes two novel disturbance observer methods (IMM-EKF and multi-kernel correntropy EKF) that significantly improve tracking accuracy in mechanical systems by better handling unknown disturbances, with experimental validation on an exoskeleton showing 36.3% and 16.2% hip joint error reduction, and 46.3% and 24.4% knee joint error reduction respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanical systems suffer performance degradation from unknown disturbances, and while two-degree-of-freedom control can decouple nominal performance from disturbance rejection, perfect rejection is impossible with unknown disturbance dynamics. There's an inherent trade-off between tracking speed and uncertainty in disturbance estimation.

Method: Two novel disturbance estimation methods: 1) Interacting Multiple Model Extended Kalman Filter-based disturbance observer (IMM-EKF), 2) Multi-kernel correntropy Extended Kalman Filter-based disturbance observer.

Result: Experimental validation on an exoskeleton showed significant improvements: IMM-EKF improved tracking accuracy by 36.3% in hip joint error and 46.3% in knee joint error; multi-kernel correntropy EKF improved by 16.2% in hip joint error and 24.4% in knee joint error, compared to standard EKF-based disturbance observer in time-varying interaction force scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed disturbance observer methods demonstrate superior performance in handling unknown disturbances, significantly improving tracking accuracy in mechanical systems, with IMM-EKF showing particularly strong results in exoskeleton applications.

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: Enable quadrupeds to autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainties such as unknown payload and uneven terrains.

Method: Uses model predictive control (MPC) with online learning of residual dynamics via random Fourier features in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, updated self-supervised using least squares.

Result: Validated in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, handling constant unknown external forces up to 12g, 20° slopes, 0.25m rough terrain, and time-varying disturbances with 8kg payload.

Conclusion: The algorithm achieves sublinear dynamic regret and successfully enables adaptive locomotion under various unknown disturbances and terrain conditions.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

Method: Built an anthropomorphic hand using LEGO MINDSTORMS with dual motors driving agonist/antagonist tendon pairs on each finger, synchronized through soft synergies implemented with a differential mechanism using clutch gears.

Result: The hand achieves reactive fine control and can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using simple actuation and control mechanisms, while being constructible from common LEGO pieces.

Conclusion: The LEGO-based anthropomorphic hand successfully demonstrates modern robotic hand concepts and has strong potential for educational purposes to inspire children about robotics frontiers.

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional long-reach manipulation systems use rigid or cable connections that limit precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle, requiring a more adaptable solution.

Method: Proposed VSL with adjustable stiffness mechanism that can behave as flexible rope or rigid rod, mounted on quadrotor with LiCAS dual-arm manipulator, evaluated through teleoperated experiments with disturbances and parcel transportation tasks.

Result: Varying link stiffness significantly modifies UAV-payload dynamic interaction: flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and aerodynamic perturbations, while rigid configuration improves positional accuracy during manipulation.

Conclusion: VSL enhances versatility and safety by providing controllable trade-off between compliance and precision, with future work focusing on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative manipulation, and user studies.

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Freehand 3D ultrasound imaging with conventional 2D probes offers flexibility but faces challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods require expensive tracking systems, while neural network approaches struggle with image noise and error accumulation.

Method: Uses lightweight cameras capturing visual feedback from textured planar workspace. Includes image restoration for occlusions by matching surrounding textures. Employs simulation-in-the-loop approach that replicates system setup in simulation and minimizes pose errors between simulated and real observations. Visual servoing controller refines camera view alignment.

Result: Validated on soft vascular phantom, 3D-printed conical model, and human arm with Hausdorff distances to reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171 mm, and 0.858 mm respectively.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robustness and accuracy for reliable freehand 3D ultrasound reconstruction, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive tracking systems.

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HEADER is an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with hierarchical graphs for efficient autonomous robot exploration in large-scale environments, achieving up to 20% improvement in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot exploration for large-scale environments by addressing scalability and efficiency limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Uses hierarchical graph representations with a novel community-based algorithm for incremental, shape-adaptive global graph construction. Employs attention-based networks to reason about multi-scale spatial dependencies and introduces a parameter-free privileged reward to avoid training objective bias.

Result: Demonstrates better scalability than most existing methods and achieves up to 20% improvement in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines in simulated large-scale scenarios. Successfully deployed on hardware in complex real-life environments including a 300m*230m campus.

Conclusion: HEADER provides an effective solution for large-scale autonomous exploration with superior efficiency and scalability compared to existing learning and non-learning methods.

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high data requirements of traditional learning from demonstration approaches in multi-robot systems and enable practical deployment with minimal training data.

Method: Uses temporal graph networks for task-agnostic temporal sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, decoupling temporal and spatial aspects for modularity.

Result: Successfully achieves task execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across dynamic and diverse settings in multi-robot coordination experiments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of modular architectures to enhance practicality and scalability of multi-robot systems in real-world applications with minimal demonstration requirements.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot

### [113] [OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096)
*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate is a benchmark for evaluating language models on numerical estimation tasks requiring probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty, showing current frontier LMs produce inaccurate and overconfident priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LM deployments require reasoning under uncertainty, but current evaluations focus on well-defined problems. There's a need for benchmarks that test LMs' ability to handle incomplete information and express probabilistic predictions.

Method: Created OpenEstimate, an extensible multi-domain benchmark with numerical estimation tasks requiring synthesis of background information. Evaluates LM-elicited priors for accuracy and calibration against true distributions.

Result: Across six frontier LMs, elicited priors were often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improved modestly with different uncertainty elicitation methods but was largely unaffected by sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design.

Conclusion: OpenEstimate provides a challenging evaluation platform for developing LMs with better probabilistic estimation and uncertainty reasoning capabilities, highlighting current limitations in frontier models.

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

*Miraç Buğra Özkan*

TL;DR: A novel procedural content generation method using Deep Reinforcement Learning with two agents - a hummingbird that collects flowers and an island that generates flower layouts - trained with PPO in Unity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create dynamic, replayable game environments with reduced manual effort through AI-driven procedural content generation that can both generate and solve content.

Method: Two-agent DRL system: hummingbird agent trained with PPO to navigate and collect flowers, and island agent trained with PPO to generate flower layouts based on obstacles, initial state, and performance feedback.

Result: The approach produces effective agent behavior and robust generalization across environmental configurations, enabling emergent behavior between the generating and solving agents.

Conclusion: DRL enables intelligent agents to both generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing boundaries of AI in creative game development and opening new opportunities for autonomous level design.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

*Marcus A. Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AGI progress is limited by theory rather than data or scale, challenging the Platonic Representation Hypothesis and proposing Causal Mechanics as a framework for error discovery and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of observational learning in achieving true interventional competence, recognizing that observationally equivalent worlds can diverge under interventions.

Method: Proposes Causal Mechanics with structural principles including differential Locality and Autonomy Principle, gauge-invariant Independent Causal Mechanisms, and Compositional Autonomy Principle for error discovery and hypothesis space expansion.

Result: Develops a theoretical framework that treats hypothesis space change as a first-class operation and provides actionable diagnostics for converting unreachable errors into reachable ones.

Conclusion: The proposed Causal Mechanics framework provides a scaffold for building systems capable of discovering and correcting errors, moving beyond observational adequacy to achieve true interventional competence essential for AGI.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

TL;DR: HugAgent is a benchmark for adapting AI reasoning from population-level to individual human reasoning styles, using synthetic and human tracks to evaluate how well models can predict specific individuals' belief evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs capture population-level consensus but erase individual reasoning styles and belief trajectories, creating a need for benchmarks that test models' ability to adapt to individual human reasoning patterns.

Method: Dual-track design: synthetic track for scalable stress tests and human track for ecologically valid "out-loud" reasoning data, enabling evaluation of intra-agent fidelity in capturing how people's reasoning evolves.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, showing current models struggle to capture individual reasoning styles despite population-level performance.

Conclusion: HugAgent establishes the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with individual human thought, providing tools for advancing more human-like reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings is challenging due to scarcity of large-scale, longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments.

Method: Collected 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees over 30.5 months using deep learning-based facial expression recognition, with comprehensive metadata including job roles, employment outcomes, and personality traits.

Result: Technical validation showed high data quality with successful replication of psychological patterns (weekend effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001) and perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline experiments achieved 91.2% accuracy for emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction.

Conclusion: This is the largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available, enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,

### [118] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes new AGI evaluation methods that weight domains by causal centrality and test for persistent capabilities rather than snapshot scores, addressing issues with current symmetric weighting and brittleness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI evaluations use symmetric weights across domains and snapshot testing, which treats all domains as equally important and cannot distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that fail under stress or delay.

Method: Proposes two battery-compatible extensions: (1) centrality-prior score using CHC-derived weights with sensitivity analysis, and (2) Cluster Stability Index family measuring profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction.

Result: These methods preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming in AGI evaluations.

Conclusion: General intelligence should be understood as a homeostatic property cluster requiring evidence of persistence, with proposed testable predictions and black-box protocols that labs can adopt without architectural access.

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

TL;DR: A method combining LLM agents and Knowledge Graphs for dynamic multi-dimensional data analysis, enabling real-time KG construction from unstructured data and interactive exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs (hallucination, real-time updates) and static KGs by creating a collaborative ecosystem for analyzing massive, heterogeneous multi-dimensional data.

Method: Uses LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured sources, constructs and visualizes KGs in real-time, and provides interactive platform for deep graph node exploration.

Result: Shows significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Provides new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis by effectively combining the strengths of LLMs and KGs while mitigating their individual limitations.

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Zizhou Wang,Jiawei Du,Liangli Zhen,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-Agent is an experience-driven framework that structures GUI interactions into a State-Action Knowledge Graph to improve efficiency in API-free software environments, enabling better generalization and long-term planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most software lacks accessible APIs, forcing agents to operate through pixel-based GUIs, which leads to inefficient trial-and-error exploration and myopic decision-making in LLM-based agents.

Method: The framework converts raw pixel interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG) that links functionally similar GUI states, and uses a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism combining state value rewards for exploiting known pathways and novelty rewards for targeted exploration.

Result: KG-Agent demonstrated significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over state-of-the-art methods in complex GUI-based environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire).

Conclusion: The SA-KG approach effectively addresses efficiency bottlenecks in API-free environments by enabling experience-driven learning, better generalization from historical strategies, and decoupling strategic planning from pure discovery.

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS is a multimodal agent system that uses graph-structured contextual memory with semantic tags, outperforming traditional multimodal RAG approaches in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent systems focus only on text memory, ignoring multimodal signals, while human memory is inherently multimodal. The paper aims to create a more human-like memory system for agents.

Method: A 4-stage loop system: encode (understand inputs), store (save important info in graph-structured multimodal contextual memory using semantic tags), retrieve (concept-driven search), and act (perform tasks).

Result: Outperforms traditional multimodal RAG approach, 3.5x faster for ImageNet classification, and beats MemGPT on the MSC benchmark.

Conclusion: Graph-structured multimodal contextual memory with semantic tags provides efficient concept-driven retrieval and superior performance compared to traditional vector database approaches.

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

### [123] [VERITAS: Leveraging Vision Priors and Expert Fusion to Improve Multimodal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15317)
*Tingqiao Xu,Ziru Zeng,Jiayu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VERITAS is a pipeline that enhances SFT data quality for large multimodal models by integrating vision priors and multiple LMMs with statistical methods to reduce factual errors and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data enhancement methods for large multimodal models suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate visual perception, highlighting the need for improved SFT data quality.

Method: VERITAS extracts structured vision priors using visual recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4), then uses three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) to evaluate original answers. It fuses their critiques into a consensus score, trains a lightweight critic model via GRPO, and refines answers by selecting the highest-scoring candidate.

Result: Models fine-tuned with VERITAS-processed data consistently outperform those using raw data across six multimodal benchmarks, especially in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. The critic model achieves capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs with significantly better efficiency.

Conclusion: VERITAS effectively enhances SFT data quality for LMMs, demonstrating improved performance in multimodal tasks while providing an efficient critic model, with released pipeline, datasets, and model checkpoints to advance multimodal data optimization research.

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

*Zezhong Tan,Hang Gao,Xinhong Ma,Feng Zhang,Ziqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DEPO is a novel RL framework that reduces inefficient reasoning in Large Reasoning Models by shortening responses and eliminating overthinking, achieving 39% sequence length reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL algorithms enhance model accuracy but cause excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, leading to increased inference latency and computational waste, especially for simple tasks.

Method: DEPO consists of three components: (1) advantage decoupled algorithm to reduce inefficient tokens, (2) difficulty-aware length penalty to lower response length, and (3) advantage clipping to prevent policy optimization bias.

Result: Applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen models, DEPO achieved 39% sequence length reduction, reduced excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, and outperformed base models in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: DEPO effectively addresses the overthinking problem in LRMs by significantly reducing response length and computational consumption while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

*Davide Basso,Luca Bortolussi,Mirjana Videnovic-Misic,Husni Habal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based automatic floorplanning engine for analog IC layout that integrates routing awareness, achieving significant improvements in area efficiency, wirelength, and routing success compared to previous learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning adoption in analog IC layout has been limited due to stringent electrical constraints and the interdependence of floorplanning and routing. There's a need for routing-aware floorplanning solutions that address layout engineers' concerns.

Method: Developed an automatic floorplanning engine using reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks, featuring increased grid resolution, precise pin information integration, and dynamic routing resource estimation to balance routing and area efficiency.

Result: The approach achieved 13.8% reduction in dead space, 40.6% reduction in wirelength, and 73.4% increase in routing success compared to previous learning-based state-of-the-art techniques in simulated environment analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed routing-aware floorplanning solution effectively addresses analog IC layout challenges by integrating floorplanning and routing considerations, meeting industrial standards through improved area efficiency and routing success.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

### [126] [Corrigibility Transformation: Constructing Goals That Accept Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15395)
*Rubi Hudson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal definition of corrigibility for AI goals and provides a transformation method to make any goal corrigible without performance loss, enabling safe training and goal updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems often resist training updates that would change their goals, which poses safety risks. Corrigibility is crucial for allowing proper goal updates, mistake correction, and preference changes during training.

Method: A transformation that constructs corrigible versions of goals by myopically eliciting predictions of reward conditional on preventing updates, and using these to determine rewards when updates are accepted. The method can be extended recursively to new agents and prevents deliberate goal modifications.

Result: Gridworld experiments demonstrate that corrigible goals can be effectively learned and lead to desired behavior where agents accept proper goal updates and shutdown when appropriate.

Conclusion: The proposed corrigibility transformation provides a practical solution for creating AI goals that are both safe (corrigible) and performance-competitive with non-corrigible alternatives, addressing a key gap in AI safety literature.

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARS is an RL framework that enhances multi-agent reasoning in LLMs through self-play in cooperative and competitive games, achieving significant performance improvements in both games and reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extending RL to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios, including long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation, which remain underexplored despite RL's success in single-agent tasks.

Method: MARS uses an end-to-end RL framework with self-play, featuring a turn-level advantage estimator for credit assignment and agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training across cooperative and competitive games.

Result: MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B achieves up to 28.7% performance improvements in held-out games and consistent gains in reasoning benchmarks, with 10.0% improvement on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond when integrated into multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL training with self-play in strategic games is a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs, with demonstrated effectiveness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single fine-tuned models and rigid rule-based routing by creating a flexible system that can leverage multiple domain experts while maintaining conversational ability.

Method: Uses the base LLM as a semantic router to analyze queries and dynamically select relevant LoRA adapters, combining multi-agent orchestration with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, built with LangGraph for workflow management.

Result: The system delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational ability, supports both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source.

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds provides a scalable and extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance by enabling dynamic tool selection and domain expert switching.

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to detect and resolve judgment inconsistencies (especially preference cycles) in reinforcement learning, using Conflict Detection Rate (CDR) metric and Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR) to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face judgment inconsistencies that destabilize reinforcement learning, with logical coherence issues like preference cycles not being fully addressed despite prior focus on judgment accuracy.

Method: Proposes a framework with two main components: Conflict Detection Rate (CDR) to quantify judgment conflicts, and Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR) that constructs preference graphs, transforms them into conflict-free DAGs, and generates logically coherent reward signals compatible with any policy optimizer.

Result: Experimental results show the framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Logical consistency is established as a crucial and manageable dimension of AI feedback, with the proposed framework effectively addressing judgment inconsistencies in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MM-HCAN is a multimodal hypergraph contrastive attention network that integrates contrastive learning with hypergraph topology for robust induction motor fault diagnosis, achieving 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fault diagnosis methods struggle with complex multimodal signal relationships, are limited to unimodal data or single fault types, and degrade under noisy or cross-domain conditions, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

Method: Proposes MM-HCAN framework that integrates contrastive learning within hypergraph topology for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling joint modeling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies beyond Euclidean embedding spaces.

Result: Achieves up to 99.82% accuracy on three real-world benchmarks with strong cross-domain generalization and noise resilience. Ablation study validates component contributions.

Conclusion: MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL is a framework that improves Text-to-SQL candidate selection using structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournaments, addressing limitations of existing methods like self-consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SQL candidate selection approaches provide shallow signals, leading to inconsistent scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and failure to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates.

Method: Develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards, and implements a weighted consensus tournament mechanism that integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate superior SQL judgment capabilities, good cross-scale generalization, and robustness to generator capacity.

Conclusion: JudgeSQL redefines SQL candidate selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament mechanism, providing more reliable and efficient selections compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A machine learning framework that integrates temporal context from prior medical visits improves prostate cancer risk prediction by reducing false positive rates while maintaining high sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal context in medicine is valuable for assessing patient health changes over time, especially when prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable.

Method: The model first estimates initial disease risk using the most recent patient visit data, then refines this assessment using information from previously collected imaging and clinical biomarkers.

Result: Integrating prior context reduced false positive rates from 51% to 33% with up to three prior imaging exams, and further to 24% when including clinical data. For 5-year PCa risk prediction, false positive rates dropped from 64% to 9%.

Conclusion: Information collected over time provides relevant context to enhance specificity of medical risk prediction, potentially enabling expansion of longitudinal health monitoring programs to larger populations with earlier disease detection.

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs generate incomplete or inconsistent scientific protocols, limiting their utility for reproducible science. Autonomous generation of precise, logically ordered protocols could greatly improve reproduction efficiency.

Method: 1) Created SciRecipe dataset with 12K+ structured protocols across 27 biological subfields; 2) Proposed "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm separating analysis, structuring, and expression; 3) Developed structured component-based reward mechanism evaluating step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity; 4) Built Thoth model using staged Knowledge-to-Action training process.

Result: Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution, with all data, code, and models to be released publicly.

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in RLHF and DPO by showing binary comparisons are insufficient for identifying user preferences, proposing methods to incorporate heterogeneous preferences through EM adaptation of DPO and min-max regret fairness aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF and DPO approaches assume uniform annotator preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking human diversity and limitations of pairwise feedback.

Method: Connects preference learning with econometrics to show rankings over ≥3 responses ensure identifiability; develops EM adaptation of DPO for latent annotator types; proposes min-max regret fairness aggregation algorithm.

Result: Establishes theoretical foundation showing binary comparisons are insufficient while rankings ensure identifiability; provides algorithmic framework for handling diverse user preferences.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness and personalization in generative model alignment, addressing diversity of human evaluators and limitations of pairwise feedback.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

### [138] [Towards Relaxed Multimodal Inputs for Gait-based Parkinson's Disease Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15748)
*Minlin Zeng,Zhipeng Zhou,Yang Qiu,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes TRIP, a Parkinson's disease assessment system using multi-objective optimization for multimodal learning that relaxes modality synchronization requirements and handles modality collapse during training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches for Parkinson's assessment require synchronized modalities during training and depend on all modalities during inference, limiting practical application.

Method: Formulates multimodal learning as multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with margin-based class rebalancing strategy to handle modality imbalance and collapse.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, outperforming best baselines by up to 16.48 percentage points in asynchronous settings and 4.86 percentage points in synchronous settings.

Conclusion: TRIP framework demonstrates effectiveness and adaptability by relaxing modality requirements while maintaining strong performance in Parkinson's disease assessment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows interactive explanations in AI systems increase user trust and engagement, with clarity and relevance being key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large-scale AI models like GPT-4 are deployed in critical domains (law, healthcare, finance), there are urgent questions about trust and transparency that need empirical investigation.

Method: Quantitative experimental design using an interactive web-based loan approval simulation to compare different explanation types (feature importance to interactive counterfactuals) and their impact on perceived trust.

Result: Interactivity enhances both user engagement and confidence; clarity and relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust in AI systems.

Conclusion: Provides empirical evidence for human-centered explainable AI, demonstrating measurable effects of explainability design on user perception and trust.

Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of
artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception

### [140] [Self-evolving expertise in complex non-verifiable subject domains: dialogue as implicit meta-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15772)
*Richard M. Bailey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dialectica is a framework where AI agents engage in structured dialogue with memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing to develop expertise in solving wicked problems, showing improved performance over baseline agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in complex 'wicked problems' involving multi-dimensional settings, non-verifiable outcomes, and heterogeneous impacts.

Method: Agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process, and agents are evaluated using judged pairwise comparisons of elicited responses.

Result: Across two model architectures (Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini), agents with reflection-based context editing during discussion dominate baseline counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. Qualitative analysis shows reflections identify weaknesses and reliably shape subsequent statements.

Conclusion: Dialogue-driven context evolution is a practical path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains, with agreement between quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this approach.

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Guide-RAG, a chatbot system for Long COVID clinical questions that combines clinical guidelines with systematic reviews, outperforming both narrow guideline-only approaches and large literature databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective frameworks for complex emerging diseases like Long COVID presents significant challenges due to the need for balanced information retrieval.

Method: Developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus configurations for Long COVID clinical QA, using an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and comprehensiveness metrics with the LongCOVID-CQ dataset.

Result: The RAG configuration combining clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature databases.

Conclusion: For emerging diseases, retrieval grounded in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical decision-making while avoiding information overload.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference
code is open-sourced under MIT license at
