Extensive experiments conducted on\nthe 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity\ngeneralization, and animation realism.

This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level\nscheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the\ncompositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for\neach robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,\naccounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,\ncollision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to\ndisruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the\nmethod in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic\nconditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even\nunder congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for\ncomputational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment\nin complex, real-world industrial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "A two-layer framework for coordinating large robot fleets in industrial settings combines high-level scheduling (ComSat) with distributed MPC for real-time control, ensuring collision-free operation and rapid rescheduling.", "motivation": "Need scalable coordination of large mobile robot fleets in dynamic industrial environments for material handling, requiring safe operation and adaptability to disruptions.", "method": "Two-layer approach: ComSat algorithm for task assignment and time-parameterized route scheduling, plus distributed MPC for real-time trajectory control with obstacle avoidance.", "result": "High task completion rates and robust behavior in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, even under congestion.", "conclusion": "The modular framework provides computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for complex real-world industrial deployment."}}

This\npresents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely\ndetection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and\nprevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is\nfundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper\ninvestigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing\nanomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing\nthe embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse\n2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs\ncan act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video\ninto text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate\nfour open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and\nprivacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some\nmodels, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially\nfull-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.\nThese results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially\nsalient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity\nobfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial\ngrounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight\nspatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,\nand privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions\nzero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for\nembodied, real-world video understanding.

It also includes variants for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding and a translator to project representations into CLIP's language space.", "result": "Concerto outperforms standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8% respectively in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, it achieves 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet and sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks.", "conclusion": "Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency, demonstrating that multisensory-inspired approaches can significantly advance spatial representation learning."}}
