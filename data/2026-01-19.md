  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations (like optical flow) is valuable for control and generative tasks, but remains challenging and underexplored with noisy real-world data.

Method: Unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture trained on web-scale human activity data with crucial data preprocessing techniques and strong image pretraining.

Result: The model enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction and can be extended to robotic manipulation and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: FOFPred demonstrates cross-domain versatility, confirming the value of unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

*Yizhou Wang,Sameer Pusegaonkar,Yuxing Wang,Anqi Li,Vishal Kumar,Chetan Sethi,Ganapathy Aiyer,Yun He,Kartikay Thakkar,Swapnil Rathi,Bhushan Rupde,Zheng Tang,Sujit Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapted Sparse4D framework for large-scale infrastructure achieves SOTA HOTA 45.22 on AI City Challenge 2025 with optimized TensorRT plugin enabling 64+ camera streams on single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitioning autonomous driving models to static camera networks faces challenges from heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion in industrial infrastructure environments.

Method: Adapted Sparse4D framework with absolute world-coordinate geometric priors, occlusion-aware ReID embedding, generative data augmentation using NVIDIA COSMOS, and optimized TensorRT plugin for MSDA.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art HOTA of 45.22 on AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, with 2.15× speedup enabling single GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

Conclusion: The camera-only framework successfully addresses MTMC tracking challenges in industrial infrastructure with optimized performance for real-time deployment at scale.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA). Our hardware-accelerated implementation achieves a $2.15\times$ speedup on modern GPU architectures, enabling a single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

### [4] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluated three VLMs (GPT-4o, Florence 2, LLaVa-1.5) for construction worker action and emotion recognition from images, finding GPT-4o performs best but all struggle with semantically similar categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics need human behavior interpretation for safe construction collaboration; VLMs offer potential for recognizing worker actions/emotions without extensive domain-specific training, addressing construction's labeled data scarcity.

Method: Evaluated three VLMs using curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across 10 action and 10 emotion categories, assessing outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple metrics (F1-score, accuracy, confusion matrices).

Result: GPT-4o achieved highest performance (action: F1=0.756, accuracy=0.799; emotion: F1=0.712, accuracy=0.773). Florence 2 performed moderately (action F1=0.497, emotion F1=0.414). LLaVa-1.5 showed lowest performance (action F1=0.466, emotion F1=0.461). All models struggled with semantically close categories.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs offer baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction, but need domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing for real-world reliability.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [5] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OOD detection performance shows non-monotonic relationship with ID accuracy - improves initially but declines when advanced training pushes accuracy beyond baseline, with strong interdependence between training strategy and detector choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the under-explored link between OOD detection performance and modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution accuracy and generalization.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study benchmarking 21 state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 models obtained via diverse training strategies, evaluated on eight OOD test sets.

Result: Contrary to common assumption, OOD performance shows non-monotonic relationship with ID accuracy - improves initially but declines when advanced training pushes accuracy beyond baseline. Strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and OOD performance observed.

Conclusion: No single OOD detection method is universally optimal; performance depends on complex interplay between training strategy and detector choice, challenging the assumption that higher ID accuracy always leads to better OOD detection.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [6] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reducing temporal information while increasing frame resolution affects 3D CNN action recognition models, and tests attention mechanisms to compensate for lost temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between temporal information and spatial resolution in action recognition, and to explore how attention mechanisms can mitigate performance loss when temporal features are reduced.

Method: Created modified versions of MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D models with reduced temporal data but increased frame resolution, added dropout before final classifier, then developed 10 variants with attention blocks (CBAM, TCN, multi-headed attention, channel attention). Tested on UCF101 dataset.

Result: Best accuracy of 88.98% achieved with multi-headed attention added to modified R(2+1)D. Variants showed different class-level accuracy patterns despite similar overall performance improvements. Attention mechanisms helped compensate for missing temporal features.

Conclusion: Missing temporal features significantly impact performance in high-resolution models, but attention mechanisms can partially compensate for this loss. Different attention blocks affect class-level accuracy differently despite similar overall performance gains.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

### [7] [Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880)
*Chongcong Jiang,Tianxingjian Ding,Chuhan Song,Jiachen Tu,Ziyang Yan,Yihua Shao,Zhenyi Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Tianyu Han,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3 is a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, created by fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale medical imaging datasets to overcome domain shift limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Promptable segmentation models like SAM3 have strong generalization but struggle with medical images due to domain shifts, lack of spatial prompts, and complex anatomical structures. Vanilla SAM3's apparent competitiveness relies on strong geometric priors like ground-truth bounding boxes.

Method: Fully fine-tuned SAM3 on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities with paired segmentation masks and text prompts, moving beyond prompt engineering to holistic model adaptation.

Result: Medical SAM3 achieves consistent and significant performance gains across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context.

Conclusion: Medical SAM3 establishes as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging, demonstrating the importance of holistic model adaptation for robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [8] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrankenMotion: A diffusion-based framework for fine-grained, part-aware human motion generation using temporally-structured part-level text annotations created with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation methods lack fine-grained control over individual body parts due to absence of part-level motion annotations, limiting spatial and temporal controllability.

Method: Constructed a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations using LLMs, then developed a diffusion-based framework where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt.

Result: FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted for this setting and can compose motions unseen during training.

Conclusion: First work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and enable motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control, offering superior controllability.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL-guided Latent Diffusion Model generates synthetic DUV-FSM patches to overcome data scarcity, improving breast cancer margin assessment accuracy to 96.47%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast-conserving surgery needs precise margin assessment, but deep learning models for DUV-FSM imaging are limited by scarce annotated data.

Method: Self-supervised learning-guided Latent Diffusion Model generates synthetic training patches using embeddings from fine-tuned DINO teacher, then combines real and synthetic data to fine-tune Vision Transformer with patch aggregation for WSI classification.

Result: Achieves 96.47% accuracy with FID score of 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines in 5-fold cross-validation.

Conclusion: SSL-guided LDM effectively addresses DUV data scarcity, enabling robust deep learning models for accurate breast cancer margin assessment.

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

### [12] [Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931)
*David Szczecina,Hudson Sun,Anthony Bertnyk,Niloofar Azad,Kyle Gao,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based models (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN) outperform transformer-based models (DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, DINOv2) for tree canopy detection with only 150 annotated images due to better generalization in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree canopy detection is important for environmental monitoring, but real-world data annotation is scarce. The Solafune competition provides only 150 annotated images, creating challenges for training deep models without overfitting.

Method: Evaluated five architectures: YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNET, and DINOv2 on canopy segmentation with extreme data scarcity. Analyzed training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under small-data constraints.

Result: Pretrained CNN-based models (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN) generalize significantly better than transformer-based models. Transformer architectures struggle due to high data requirements, lack of strong inductive biases, and differences between semantic vs instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNN-based methods remain most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery. Transformers need substantial pretraining or augmentation for low-data regimes, and task differences (semantic vs instance segmentation) significantly impact performance.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

### [13] [PatientVLM Meets DocVLM: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Between Vision-Language Models for Efficient Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10945)
*K Lokesh,Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri,Uday Agarwal,Apoorva Challa,Shreya K Gowda,Somesh Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCDF uses two VLMs to simulate doctor-patient diagnostic dialogues for improving medical AI beyond image-only analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI medical diagnosis focuses too much on image analysis, missing crucial patient-reported symptoms that doctors use in real consultations, limiting diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) with two VLMs: DocVLM generates follow-up questions based on images and dialogue history, while PatientVLM responds using symptom profiles from ground-truth diagnoses.

Result: Clinical validation confirmed synthetic symptoms were clinically relevant, comprehensive, and realistic. Fine-tuning DocVLM with these dialogues significantly outperformed image-only training.

Conclusion: Realistic symptom elicitation through simulated doctor-patient dialogues substantially improves diagnostic AI performance over image-only approaches.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Conclusion: MMedExpert-R1 successfully addresses critical mismatches in clinical reasoning by combining domain-specific adaptation with clinical guideline reinforcement, creating a unified agent capable of robust multi-specialty alignment and reliable medical reasoning.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement.

TL;DR: IDDR-NGP is the first unified method for removing various 3D scene distractors (snow, confetti, leaves, petals) from Instant-NGP representations, using multi-view optimization and a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on specific types of distractors, lacking a unified approach for removing diverse 3D scene corruptions like snowflakes, confetti, defoliation, and petals from implicit 3D representations.

Method: Combines implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, uses LPIPS loss and multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) for joint optimization, trains end-to-end to restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to SOTA desnow methods, effectively removes both realistic and synthetic distractors, validated through extensive experiments on new benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP provides a robust unified solution for multi-type distractor removal in 3D scenes, advancing research with a new benchmark and demonstrating effectiveness across diverse corruption types.

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

TL;DR: AIGVDBench is a comprehensive benchmark for AI-generated video detection covering 31 generation models, 440k+ videos, and evaluating 33 detectors across 4 categories with 8 in-depth analyses and 4 novel findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated video detection faces two key limitations: 1) datasets are limited in scale, outdated, and lack diversity/quality; 2) benchmarks are mostly just dataset creation without systematic analysis of fundamental issues.

Method: Created AIGVDBench benchmark covering 31 state-of-the-art generation models and over 440,000 videos, then performed 1,500+ evaluations on 33 existing detectors across four distinct categories.

Result: The benchmark provides 8 in-depth analyses from multiple perspectives and identifies 4 novel findings that offer valuable insights for future research in AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: AIGVDBench provides a comprehensive and representative foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection, addressing current dataset and benchmark limitations.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: M3DDM+ improves video outpainting quality by fixing training-inference mask mismatch in M3DDM, enhancing spatial clarity and temporal consistency in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M3DDM suffers from quality degradation (spatial blur and temporal inconsistency) in challenging scenarios with limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, caused by training-inference mismatch in masking strategy.

Method: Propose M3DDM+ which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model to align training with inference requirements.

Result: M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency of the original framework.

Conclusion: Addressing the training-inference mask mismatch through uniform masking and fine-tuning effectively solves quality degradation issues in challenging video outpainting scenarios.

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Physics-aware RL paradigm for video generation that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, with MDcycle framework preserving physics feedback during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based video generation lacks physical realism, especially for rigid body motion and collisions. Physics principles are treated as conditions rather than strictly enforced constraints, limiting physical accuracy.

Method: Introduces physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces. Extends to Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle) framework for substantial fine-tuning while preserving physics-grounded feedback.

Result: Constructed new benchmark PhysRVGBench and performed extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments showing effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware RL paradigm and MDcycle framework successfully integrate physical principles into video generation, addressing the critical limitation of physical realism in current transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

TL;DR: CoDance: Unbind-Rebind framework for animating arbitrary numbers and types of characters from misaligned pose sequences, achieving SOTA performance with location-agnostic motion representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character animation methods struggle with arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between reference images and driving poses, due to rigid spatial binding and inconsistent motion rebinding.

Method: Proposes CoDance with Unbind-Rebind framework: Unbind module uses pose shift encoder with stochastic perturbations to learn location-agnostic motion; Rebind module uses text prompts and subject masks for precise motion control to intended characters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on new CoDanceBench and existing datasets, showing remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts.

Conclusion: CoDance enables robust multi-subject character animation from misaligned poses, with open-sourced code and weights to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based methods for 3D point cloud analysis suffer from suboptimal graph structures, especially sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas.

Method: Integrates graph smoothing module to optimize graph structure and minimize unreliable connections, plus enhanced local geometry learning module with shape features from adaptive geometric descriptors (eigenvectors) and distribution features from cylindrical coordinate transformation.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets validate effectiveness in various point cloud learning tasks: classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of graph smoothing and enhanced local geometry learning effectively addresses graph structure limitations and improves performance on 3D point cloud analysis tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: VIGA is a vision-as-inverse-graphics agent that reconstructs/edit scenes through iterative write-run-render-compare-revise loops, achieving significant improvements over one-shot baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding needed for vision-as-inverse-graphics tasks, requiring interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification.

Method: VIGA uses a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure with skill library (generator/verifier roles) and evolving context memory (plans, code diffs, render history), starting from empty world.

Result: Substantial improvements over one-shot baselines: 35.32% on BlenderGym, 117.17% on SlideBench, and 124.70% on new BlenderBench benchmark; task-agnostic and model-agnostic without finetuning.

Conclusion: VIGA demonstrates that iterative multimodal reasoning with execution-verification loops enables effective vision-as-inverse-graphics, providing unified evaluation protocol for foundation VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

TL;DR: SoLA-Vision proposes a layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that strategically combines linear and softmax attention layers to achieve better accuracy-computation trade-offs than purely linear or rigid hybrid designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax attention has quadratic complexity O(N²) limiting high-resolution deployment, while linear attention reduces to O(N) but suffers from compressed state representations that impair modeling capacity and accuracy. Need better trade-off between efficiency and performance.

Method: Analytical study contrasting linear vs softmax attention for vision, systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns, and proposing SoLA-Vision - a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone with fine-grained control over linear/softmax integration.

Result: SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models on ImageNet-1K, and consistently surpasses strong baselines by considerable margins on dense prediction tasks, achieving better accuracy-computation trade-offs with fewer softmax layers.

Conclusion: Fine-grained layer-wise hybridization of linear and softmax attention enables superior performance with computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for vision transformers that balances accuracy and deployment costs.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

Motivation: The massive computational and storage requirements of petabyte-scale Earth Observation archives prevent widespread use and hinder planetary-scale studies, creating barriers to democratizing global environmental monitoring.

Method: Transforms Landsat (5,7,8,9) and MODIS Terra data into quantized latent vectors using ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), condensing annual phenological cycles into 12 temporal steps with inherent denoising.

Result: Achieves ~340-fold data volume reduction (2.4 TB/year for global land surface), high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543), and 79.74% land-cover classification accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw data).

Conclusion: ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing geospatial AI by enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard workstations with robust few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint generation of aligned samples either don't consider structural alignment or use inefficient approaches like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) which is time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and produces cartoonish results.

Method: Uses Rectified Flow models with joint transport of segments in sample space, built on top of arbitrary Rectified Flow models operating on structured latent space. Focuses on structural alignment perspective for joint inference.

Result: Demonstrates high structural alignment and visual quality for sample pairs across image, video, and 3D shape generation. Improves state-of-the-art for image/video pipelines, and for 3D generation achieves comparable quality with orders of magnitude faster computation.

Conclusion: The proposed Rectified Flow-based approach provides an efficient, high-quality solution for joint inference of structurally aligned multi-modal samples, addressing limitations of existing methods while maintaining or improving performance across domains.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current person ReID methods are typically scenario-specific and require supervised training. The authors propose unsupervised multi-scenario ReID (UMS-ReID) to handle diverse real-world scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing changes, etc.) in a single coherent framework without manual annotations.

Method: Three-stage ITKM framework: 1) Fine-tune CLIP image encoder with scenario embeddings to adapt to multiple scenarios, 2) Optimize learned text embeddings with multi-scenario separation loss, 3) Use cluster/instance-level heterogeneous matching and dynamic text update to align image-text supervision.

Result: ITKM outperforms existing scenario-specific methods across multiple scenarios and demonstrates superior generalizability by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios to enhance overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed ITKM framework successfully addresses unsupervised multi-scenario ReID, showing that vision-language models can effectively handle diverse real-world scenarios through adaptive scenario embeddings and text-image alignment strategies.

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Result: Outperforms 28 baselines, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks, and demonstrates strong performance in explicit cross-lingual retrieval with only a fraction of parameters compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval, making it practical for edge deployment while handling handwriting variability and cross-lingual challenges.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset (222,736 frames, 240 anomaly events, 12 anomaly types). The MUVAD dataset addresses the gap in dynamic background UAV VAD research.

Conclusion: FTDMamba effectively handles UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds by disentangling motion patterns and jointly modeling temporal-spatial dependencies. The new MUVAD dataset enables further research in this challenging domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

TL;DR: X-Distill uses cross-architecture knowledge distillation from large ViTs to compact CNNs for data-efficient robotic manipulation, outperforming various encoder types including 3D and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Transformers (ViTs) have strong generalization but require massive data, while compact CNNs are easier to optimize in data-scarce robotic learning settings. There's a need to combine their strengths.

Method: Offline cross-architecture knowledge distillation: transfer visual representations from frozen DINOv2 teacher to ResNet-18 student on ImageNet, then fine-tune distilled encoder with diffusion policy head on target tasks.

Result: Consistently outperforms policies with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders across 34 simulated benchmarks and 5 real-world tasks. Also surpasses 3D encoders using point clouds and larger Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: Simple, well-founded distillation strategy enables state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation by synergizing large ViT generalization with CNN optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

*Vishisht Sharma,Sam Leroux,Lisa Landuyt,Nick Witvrouwen,Pieter Simoens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) accelerates video segmentation on UAVs by reusing features from static regions, reducing latency 30% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oblique aerial video is crucial for disaster response but faces SWaP constraints on UAVs, making real-time processing of high-resolution streams computationally infeasible on edge hardware.

Method: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) formulates image patches as tokens, uses lightweight similarity metrics to identify static regions, and propagates precomputed deep features to bypass redundant backbone computations.

Result: On edge-grade hardware, TTR achieves 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible segmentation accuracy degradation (< 0.5% mIoU drop).

Conclusion: TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions.

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

Conclusion: SAMannot offers a practical solution for complex video annotation tasks by combining foundation models with human oversight in a local, privacy-preserving framework that addresses current workflow limitations.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

TL;DR: CASWiT is a dual-branch Swin-based transformer for semantic UHR image segmentation that addresses memory constraints by processing context at low resolution and details at high resolution, with cross-scale fusion and SimMIM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with UHR image segmentation due to quadratic memory growth with token count, which constrains either contextual scope or spatial resolution in remote sensing applications like aerial mapping.

Method: Dual-branch Swin-based architecture with context encoder for low-resolution neighborhood processing and high-resolution encoder for UHR patches, plus cross-scale fusion module using cross-attention and gated feature injection. Includes SimMIM-style pretraining with 75% masking of high-resolution tokens and corresponding low-resolution center region.

Result: Achieves 65.83% mIoU on IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset (outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points) and 49.1% mIoU on URUR dataset (surpassing current SoTA by +0.9% under official evaluation protocol).

Conclusion: CASWiT effectively addresses memory constraints in UHR segmentation by combining context-aware processing with fine-grained feature extraction through dual-branch architecture and cross-scale fusion, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on aerial datasets.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs can generate interpretable descriptions for situational awareness, but need improvements for identifying infrequent significant events with high reliability, extracting fine-grained details, and assessing recognition quality.

Method: Proposed approach integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning, featuring: (a) fine-grained event detail extraction, (b) intelligent fine-tuning strategy superior to uninformed selection, and (c) justification generation for VLM outputs during inference.

Result: Intelligent fine-tuning mechanism improves accuracy and provides means during inference to confirm validity of VLM outputs or indicate why they may be questionable.

Conclusion: The integration of VLMs with traditional computer vision through logic reasoning enhances situational awareness capabilities by improving accuracy, enabling fine-grained detail extraction, and providing output justification mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

TL;DR: A deep learning approach for separating multiple chromogenic stains in multiplex immunohistochemistry RGB whole slide images, overcoming limitations of classical Beer-Lambert deconvolution for K>3 stains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Beer-Lambert color deconvolution becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC with more than 3 chromogens, creating a need for better stain separation methods for stain normalization, quantitative marker assessment, and cell-level analysis.

Method: Simple data-driven encoder-decoder architecture: encoder is a compact U-Net predicting K nonnegative concentration channels; decoder is a differentiable Beer-Lambert forward model with learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms discouraging unnecessary stain mixing.

Result: Excellent RGB reconstruction and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution on a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8).

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach effectively separates multiple chromogenic stains in mIHC RGB WSIs, providing crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps that outperform classical methods for multiplex settings with more than 3 stains.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

TL;DR: ML framework combining UAV and street-view imagery with thermal data identifies heat-relevant building attributes and heat exposure inequalities in urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies heat exposure in Global South cities, but scalable methods for assessing heat-relevant building attributes are lacking.

Method: Machine learning framework fusing UAV and street-view imagery via coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT), using HotSat-1 thermal infrared data to quantify building-heat relationships.

Result: Dual-modality approach outperforms single-modality by 9.3%; identifies vegetation, brighter roofing, and certain roofing materials as associated with lower heat; reveals household-level heat exposure inequalities in Dar es Salaam.

Conclusion: Localized, data-driven risk assessment is critical for equitable climate adaptation strategies, showing how ML can identify and address heat exposure inequalities linked to building materials and socio-economic factors.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUG introduces a heterogeneous uncertainty-guided paradigm for composed image retrieval that uses fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings and custom uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries vs uni-modal targets, improving robustness against noisy triplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) suffers from intrinsic noise in triplets that creates uncertainty and threatens model robustness. Existing probabilistic learning approaches are insufficient because they use instance-level holistic modeling and treat queries and targets homogeneously.

Method: HUG uses fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings for both queries and targets. It customizes heterogeneous uncertainty estimations: for multi-modal queries, it captures uncertainties about uni-modal content quality and multi-modal coordination; for uni-modal targets, it uses different uncertainty modeling. Includes dynamic weighting mechanism and uncertainty-guided objectives with holistic and fine-grained contrasts plus comprehensive negative sampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show HUG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with analysis justifying the technical contributions.

Conclusion: HUG's heterogeneous uncertainty-guided paradigm effectively addresses CIR's noise and uncertainty challenges through fine-grained probabilistic learning with customized uncertainty modeling for different modalities, leading to improved robustness and performance.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

TL;DR: SUG-Occ is a sparse 3D occupancy prediction framework that uses semantic and uncertainty guidance to reduce computation while maintaining accuracy, achieving significant improvements in both performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for full scene understanding in autonomous driving, but current methods suffer from prohibitive computation and memory overhead that prevents real-time deployment.

Method: The framework uses: 1) semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress free space projections with unsigned distance encoding for geometric consistency; 2) cascade sparse completion via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling; 3) object contextual representation mask decoder with lightweight query-context interactions instead of expensive attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark show the approach outperforms baselines with 7.34% improvement in accuracy and 57.8% gain in efficiency.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ successfully addresses the computational challenges of 3D occupancy prediction by exploiting scene sparsity while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness, enabling more practical real-time deployment for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

TL;DR: WetSAM: A SAM-based framework for wetland mapping using satellite time series and sparse point supervision, achieving 85.58% F1-score with minimal labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wetland mapping requires dense pixel-level annotation which is expensive, while practical applications rely on sparse point labels where existing models perform poorly. Seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics make single-date imagery inadequate, and foundation models like SAM fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands.

Method: Proposes WetSAM with dual-branch design: 1) Temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability; 2) Spatial branch uses temporally constrained region-growing to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels; 3) Bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight global regions (~5,000 km² each) show WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average F1-score of 85.58%, delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort.

Conclusion: WetSAM demonstrates strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping by effectively integrating temporal information from satellite time series with SAM's segmentation capabilities through sparse point supervision.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCB surface defects are critical for reliability but hard to detect due to tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions, requiring specialized solutions beyond standard object detection.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss) reduces sensitivity to positional deviations in tiny objects; 2) Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB) replaces original upsampling to preserve edge/texture details; 3) Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module adaptively strengthens perception in key scale intervals for local-global feature fusion.

Result: On PKU-PCB dataset, SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.2% mAP improvement and 4% precision increase over baseline YOLOv11n, validating effectiveness for PCB defect detection.

Conclusion: The proposed SME-YOLO framework successfully addresses PCB defect detection challenges through specialized components for tiny objects, detail preservation, and scale-aware feature fusion, demonstrating practical value for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topological definitions lack width information (thickness, length), limiting practical segmentation applications. Existing methods like persistent homology cannot fully address real-world segmentation needs that require preserving both topological structures and dimensional properties.

Method: Proposes mathematical framework integrating width information into topological characterization using persistent homology and PDE smoothing concepts. Modifies local extrema of upper-level sets to capture width properties. Incorporates enhanced topological description into variational segmentation models and designs neural networks with proper loss functions to enforce topological and width constraints.

Result: Method successfully preserves topological invariants (connectivity, genus counts) while ensuring segmented structures retain critical width attributes (line thickness, length). Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness in maintaining topological fidelity while embedding width characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between topological structure preservation and width information capture, enabling more practical and accurate image segmentation that respects both topological and dimensional properties through variational constraints and neural network implementations.

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

TL;DR: Map2Thought is a framework for explicit, interpretable spatial reasoning in 3D vision-language models using metric cognitive maps and cognitive chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs, addressing the need for transparent geometric understanding rather than black-box approaches.

Method: Combines Metric Cognitive Map (discrete grid + continuous metric representation) with Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (deterministic geometric operations like vector operations, bounding-box distances, occlusion-aware cues) for interpretable reasoning.

Result: Achieves 59.9% accuracy with half the supervision (close to 60.9% baseline with full dataset), and outperforms SOTA by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% on 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets of VSI-Bench.

Conclusion: Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding through explicit spatial reasoning, demonstrating strong performance with reduced supervision and interpretable inference traces.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale livestock operations pose health and environmental risks while being vulnerable to threats like diseases and extreme weather. As these operations grow, accurate and scalable mapping becomes crucial for monitoring and regulation.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) Detect infrastructure (barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) using domain-tuned YOLOv8 and SAM2 masks with component-specific filtering; (2) Extract structured descriptors (counts, areas, orientations, spatial relations) and fuse with deep visual features using lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier; (3) Output CAFO type predictions with mask-level attributions linking decisions to visible infrastructure.

Conclusion: The infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline enables accurate, scalable CAFO mapping with interpretable decisions, supporting environmental monitoring, public health, and regulatory oversight of large-scale livestock operations.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show ho

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face significant memory and computational bottlenecks from growing KV cache during inference. While MLA compresses KV cache effectively, adapting existing VLMs to MLA without costly pretraining remains unexplored.

Method: Two core techniques: (1) modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that selectively masks nonessential dimensions for both traditional and multimodal settings, and (2) modality-decoupled low-rank approximation that independently compresses visual and textual KV spaces. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with focus on minimizing output activation error rather than parameter distance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Conclusion: MHA2MLA-VLM provides a parameter-efficient, multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA architecture, addressing KV cache bottlenecks while maintaining performance with minimal adaptation cost.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models for autonomous driving rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models, lacking language-grounded reasoning and long-horizon planning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train VLA model to encode ego/agent dynamics into latent tokens supervised by planning, motion, and language tasks; 2) Perform language-conditioned autoregressive generation with rollout-consistency loss to stabilize predictions and maintain text-action alignment.

Result: On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score by +15.7 and success rate by +26.2, achieving state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance with strong zero-shot robustness.

Conclusion: Generative, language-conditioned reasoning shows promise as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, enabling temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts for long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReScene4D enables consistent 4D instance segmentation in indoor scenes with sparse temporal observations by adapting 3DSIS architectures with cross-observation context sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments evolve over time with objects moving, appearing, or disappearing, but existing methods struggle with temporally sparse observations. 3DSIS methods lack temporal reasoning and require discrete matching, while 4D LiDAR approaches rely on high-frequency measurements uncommon in longer-horizon indoor scene evolution.

Method: ReScene4D adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, using shared context to enable consistent instance tracking while also improving standard 3DSIS quality. Introduces t-mAP metric extending mAP to reward temporal identity consistency.

Result: ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes with sparse temporal observations.

Conclusion: The proposed ReScene4D method effectively addresses the challenge of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation, demonstrating that shared context across observations enables consistent instance tracking and improves segmentation quality, with the new t-mAP metric providing appropriate evaluation for temporal consistency.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeR generates 3D object shapes from casually captured image sequences using multi-modal inputs (SLAM points, posed images, captions) and rectified flow transformers, outperforming existing methods by 2.7x in Chamfer distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D shape generation methods require clean, unoccluded inputs which are unrealistic for real-world scenarios. There's a need for robust methods that can handle casually captured data with occlusions, clutter, and imperfect segmentation.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf tools (visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection, vision-language models) to extract sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and captions for each object. A rectified flow transformer is trained to condition on these modalities. Employs compositional augmentations, curriculum training (object- to scene-level), and strategies for handling background clutter.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 2.7x improvement in Chamfer distance compared to state-of-the-art. Introduces new evaluation benchmark with 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations.

Conclusion: ShapeR demonstrates robust 3D shape generation from casually captured data, addressing real-world challenges through multi-modal conditioning and specialized training techniques, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

TL;DR: UniX is a unified medical foundation model that separates chest X-ray understanding and generation into autoregressive and diffusion branches, using cross-modal attention to guide generation with understanding features, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models struggle to unify visual understanding and generation because these tasks have conflicting goals - semantic abstraction vs pixel-level reconstruction. Existing parameter-shared autoregressive architectures often compromise performance in one or both tasks.

Method: UniX decouples understanding and generation into separate branches: an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. It introduces cross-modal self-attention to dynamically guide generation with understanding features, combined with data cleaning and multi-stage training.

Result: On two benchmarks, UniX achieves 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. It performs on par with task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniX establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation by effectively separating and coordinating the two tasks, leveraging diffusion models for superior generation while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

*Gerard Yeo,Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs implicitly encode psychologically-grounded trustworthiness signals from web narratives without explicit supervision, with strongest associations to fairness, certainty, and accountability dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs represent perceived trustworthiness in psychologically coherent ways, given their increasing integration into search, recommendation, and conversational systems where trust is crucial for user navigation of online information.

Method: Analyzed instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) using PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Conducted layer- and head-level activation analyses, probing analyses for linearly decodable trust signals, and examined fine-tuning effects.

Result: Systematic activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts across models; trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining; trust signals are linearly decodable; fine-tuning refines rather than restructures representations; strongest associations with fairness, certainty, and accountability-self dimensions.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, providing a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trustworthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

TL;DR: AI agents help job seekers write better referral requests using LLM improver and evaluator agents, with RAG enhancing weaker requests by 14% without harming stronger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help job seekers write more effective job referral requests in professional online communities by leveraging AI assistance to improve their chances of receiving referrals.

Method: Two-agent system: 1) Improver agent rewrites referral requests using LLM, 2) Evaluator agent measures revision quality using a model trained to predict referral success probability. Enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to prevent harmful edits to strong requests.

Result: LLM revisions increase predicted success rates for weaker requests but reduce them for stronger requests. RAG prevents degradation of strong requests while amplifying improvements for weak ones, resulting in 14% predicted success increase for weaker requests without harming stronger ones.

Conclusion: AI agents with RAG can effectively improve job referral requests, providing low-cost signals for promising features before real-world testing, though model-predicted improvements don't guarantee actual referral success.

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORBITFLOW is an adaptive KV cache management system for long-context LLM serving that dynamically optimizes GPU memory usage to meet latency SLOs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLM serving faces challenges with fluctuating memory demands during token generation, causing latency spikes and SLO violations with existing static offloading strategies.

Method: Uses lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to keep on GPU, continuously refines placements based on runtime feedback, and has fallback mechanism to defer memory-intensive requests.

Result: Improves SLO attainment by up to 66% for TPOT and 48% for TBT, reduces 95th percentile latency by 38%, and achieves up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ORBITFLOW effectively addresses dynamic memory demands in long-context LLM serving through adaptive KV cache management, significantly improving performance and SLO compliance.

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.

*Percy Jardine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTHA is a constrained temporal hierarchical architecture that stabilizes multi-time-scale agent coordination through structured communication manifolds and arbitration mechanisms, reducing failure cascades by 47% and improving sample efficiency 2.3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-time-scale agent architectures create temporal hierarchies but compromise coordination stability, causing inter-layer conflicts, error propagation, and scalability issues that need principled solutions.

Method: CTHA projects inter-layer communication onto structured manifolds with three constraints: Message Contract Constraints (typed summary/plan/policy packets), Authority Manifold Constraints (bounding decision spaces by temporal scope), and Arbiter Resolution Constraints (conflict-free multi-layer decision composition).

Result: 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines in complex task execution at scale.

Conclusion: CTHA provides a principled extension of temporal hierarchies that contributes to understanding multi-agent coordination and suggests directions for robust autonomous systems evolution.

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LMEE-Bench: A new benchmark for lifelong embodied agents that evaluates both exploration process and task outcomes, with MemoryExplorer method using RL-finetuned MLLM for proactive memory querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied AI tasks focus only on task completion results, neglecting the crucial exploration process and memory utilization needed for lifelong learning in complex environments.

Method: Propose LMEE-Bench dataset with multi-goal navigation and memory-based QA, and MemoryExplorer method that RL-finetunes multimodal LLM with multi-task rewards (action prediction, frontier selection, QA) to encourage active memory querying.

Result: MemoryExplorer achieves significant advantages over state-of-the-art embodied exploration models in long-horizon tasks through proactive exploration and better memory recall.

Conclusion: The LMEE framework successfully unifies exploratory cognition with decision-making for lifelong learning, with MemoryExplorer demonstrating effective memory utilization for complex embodied tasks.

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

TL;DR: Paper proposes trend-based heuristic models for complex product innovation, using simple increasing/decreasing/constant trends as minimal information quantifiers, with solutions represented as scenario transition graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze complex product-innovation processes using simplified, information-efficient models that avoid reliance on numerical values or rough sets, making the analysis more accessible and computationally tractable.

Method: Uses heuristics expressed as simple trends (increasing, decreasing, constant) as minimally information-intensive quantifiers. Models solutions as sets of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by transition graphs where system behavior is depicted as paths within the graph.

Result: Develops a framework where any possible future or past behavior of complex product-innovation systems can be represented as paths within a transition graph of scenarios, providing a structured way to analyze innovation processes.

Conclusion: Trend-based heuristic modeling with transition graphs offers an effective approach to understanding and analyzing complex product-innovation processes using minimal information while capturing essential behavioral patterns.

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARC-AGI-2 benchmark shows 24% top score, with refinement loops emerging as key 2025 theme for program optimization, while frontier AI models remain knowledge-constrained and face benchmark contamination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the state of few-shot generalization in AI through the ARC-AGI-2 competition results, examine emerging refinement loop techniques, assess frontier AI limitations, and preview next-generation reasoning challenges.

Method: Survey analysis of top-performing methods from 90 paper submissions and 15,154 competition entries, examination of refinement loop approaches (evolutionary program synthesis, application-layer refinements, zero-pretraining methods), and analysis of frontier AI lab performance reports.

Result: Top competition score reached 24% on ARC-AGI-2, refinement loops emerged as dominant 2025 theme, frontier AI labs established ARC-AGI as industry standard but remain knowledge-constrained, and new benchmark contamination issues identified.

Conclusion: Refinement loops represent significant progress in AGI development, but current AI reasoning is fundamentally limited by knowledge coverage rather than true generalization, necessitating ARC-AGI-3 with interactive reasoning challenges requiring exploration, planning, memory, and alignment capabilities.

Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes data curation for multimodal reasoning through the DCVLR challenge, showing that difficulty-based selection on aligned data drives performance gains, while dataset size mainly reduces variance and common diversity/synthetic heuristics often degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study effective data curation strategies for multimodal reasoning by isolating dataset selection while keeping the model and training protocol fixed, using the NeurIPS 2025 DCVLR challenge as a testbed.

Method: Used a compact curated dataset primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, placed first in the challenge, then conducted post-competition ablations to analyze different data curation strategies including difficulty-based selection, dataset size scaling, and diversity/synthetic augmentation heuristics.

Result: Difficulty-based example selection on aligned base dataset was the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size didn't reliably improve mean accuracy but reduced run-to-run variance. Common diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provided no benefit and often degraded performance.

Conclusion: DCVLR represents a saturation-regime evaluation where alignment and difficulty are central to data-efficient multimodal reasoning, challenging conventional wisdom about dataset size and diversity heuristics.

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: AdaMARP is an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework that improves LLM role-playing through immersive message formats and explicit scene management, trained on specialized datasets and evaluated on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM role-playing systems suffer from limited immersion and adaptability, with insufficient support for dynamic environments, multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction.

Method: Proposes AdaMARP framework with immersive message format (Thought, Action, Environment, Speech) and explicit Scene Manager with discrete actions. Creates AdaRPSet for Actor Model training and AdaSMSet for orchestration supervision, with AdaptiveBench for evaluation.

Result: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence (8B actor outperforms commercial LLMs). AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and natural role introductions (14B LLM surpasses Claude Sonnet 4.5).

Conclusion: AdaMARP demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple backbones and model scales, providing an effective solution for adaptive multi-agent role-playing with enhanced immersion and orchestration capabilities.

Abstract: LLM role-playing aims to portray arbitrary characters in interactive narratives, yet existing systems often suffer from limited immersion and adaptability. They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.

*Jiahao Wang,Shuangjia Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADES is a Bayesian optimization method using Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample protein variants, addressing epistasis and structural constraints through structure-aware posterior approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequence-based protein optimization methods struggle with high-dimensional complexities due to epistasis effects and disregard for structural constraints, limiting their effectiveness in biotechnology and medicine applications.

Method: HADES uses Hamiltonian dynamics for Bayesian optimization, introducing momentum and uncertainty in physical movements to rapidly transition proposals. It employs a position discretization procedure to propose discrete protein sequences from continuous states, and uses a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to learn structure-function relationships and create a smoothed landscape for sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments show HADES outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics, demonstrating unique advantages in leveraging mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence.

Conclusion: HADES effectively addresses protein optimization challenges by combining Hamiltonian dynamics with structure-aware modeling, enabling design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

### [61] [BAPO: Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization for Reliable Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11037)
*Shiyu Liu,Yongjing Yin,Jianhao Yan,Yunbo Tang,Qinggang Zhang,Bei Li,Xin Chen,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BAPO is an RL framework that teaches AI agents to say "I DON'T KNOW" when they reach reasoning limits, improving reliability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based agentic search systems lack reliability - they rarely admit uncertainty even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limits, leading to plausible but unreliable answers that pose risks in real-world applications.

Method: Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO) with two key components: (1) group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages IDK responses only when reasoning reaches its limit, and (2) adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration to prevent exploiting IDK as a shortcut.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Conclusion: BAPO successfully cultivates reliable boundary awareness in AI agents without compromising their accuracy, addressing a critical gap in reliability for RL-based agentic search systems.

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgencyBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based autonomous agents across 6 core capabilities in 32 real-world scenarios, featuring automated evaluation via user simulation and Docker sandbox, revealing closed-source models outperform open-source ones (48.4% vs 32.1%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single agentic capabilities and rely on human feedback, creating scalability bottlenecks. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation of long-horizon real-world scenarios with automated assessment.

Method: Created AgencyBench with 138 tasks across 32 real-world scenarios requiring ~90 tool calls and 1M tokens per scenario. Uses user simulation agent for iterative feedback and Docker sandbox for visual/functional rubric-based automated evaluation.

Result: Closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Analysis reveals disparities in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and tool-use preferences. Proprietary models perform best in native ecosystems.

Conclusion: AgencyBench serves as critical testbed for next-gen agents, highlighting need for co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. The benchmark and toolkit are publicly released to advance autonomous agent development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

TL;DR: MiCA is a lightweight module that uses causal discovery to infer mobility relations for epidemic forecasting, improving accuracy without heavy computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemic forecasting faces challenges with noisy mobility data and short, coarse case time series, limiting effectiveness of parameter-heavy models that require clean, abundant data.

Method: MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing, allowing selective exploitation of spatial structure while remaining robust to noise and data limitations.

Result: MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones across four epidemic datasets (COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, dengue) with 7.5% average relative error reduction, achieving competitive performance with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

Conclusion: MiCA provides an effective, lightweight solution for mobility-informed epidemic forecasting that balances accuracy with computational efficiency, addressing challenges of noisy data and limited temporal resolution.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

*Zhezheng Hao,Hong Wang,Jian Luo,Jianqing Zhang,Yuyan Zhou,Qiang Lin,Can Wang,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCreate is an experience-driven framework that automatically creates domain agents by learning from interaction histories, outperforming human-designed agents and existing automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent creation is labor-intensive and task-specific, with existing automated approaches treating agent generation as black-box procedures that overlook critical evidence about success/failure causes and require high computational costs.

Method: ReCreate uses an agent-as-optimizer paradigm with three components: (1) experience storage/retrieval for on-demand inspection, (2) reasoning-creating synergy pipeline mapping execution experience to scaffold edits, and (3) hierarchical updates abstracting instance-level details into reusable domain patterns.

Result: In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Conclusion: ReCreate demonstrates that systematically leveraging agent interaction histories provides rich signals for automatic agent creation and adaptation, offering a more effective and efficient approach than current methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCALE is a low-cost task-level workflow generation framework for multi-agent systems that uses self-prediction with few-shot calibration instead of expensive execution-based evaluation, reducing token usage by up to 83% with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems generate workflows at either task or query level, but their relative costs and benefits are unclear. Query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, and exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both token-costly and unreliable.

Method: Proposes SCALE framework: Self prediction of the optimizer with few shot CALibration for Evaluation instead of full validation execution. Uses self-evolution and generative reward modeling to create low-cost task-level workflows.

Result: SCALE maintains competitive performance with only 0.61% average degradation compared to existing approaches across multiple datasets, while reducing overall token usage by up to 83%.

Conclusion: Task-level workflow generation with efficient evaluation (SCALE) is a viable alternative to query-level approaches, offering significant cost savings with minimal performance trade-offs for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

*Girish A. Koushik,Helen Treharne,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TANDEM is a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from binary classification to structured reasoning, using tandem reinforcement learning between vision-language and audio-language models to achieve interpretable, temporally-grounded hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hate speech detection systems are black boxes that lack granular, interpretable evidence (timestamps, target identities) needed for effective human-in-the-loop moderation, especially for long-form multimodal content where harmful narratives emerge through complex audio-visual-textual interplay.

Method: TANDEM employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, enabling stable reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision.

Result: TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines across three benchmark datasets, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (30% improvement over SOTA) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. Binary detection is robust, but differentiating offensive vs. hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable alignment is achievable in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools that provide granular evidence for human moderators.

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deep RL hyper-heuristic framework for Job Shop Scheduling that learns to dynamically switch scheduling rules with action prefiltering and commitment mechanisms, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an adaptive scheduling system that can dynamically select appropriate scheduling rules based on system state, overcoming limitations of static heuristics and improving solution quality for complex Job Shop Scheduling Problems.

Method: Policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms: action prefiltering (restricts decisions to feasible low-level actions) and commitment mechanism (regulates heuristic switching frequency). Investigates different commitment strategies and action selection approaches.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods on standard JSSP benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hyper-heuristic framework with action prefiltering and commitment mechanisms provides an effective adaptive scheduling solution that dynamically selects appropriate rules based on system state, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods

TL;DR: Think-with-Me is an interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback at transitional conjunction points to guide LRMs, reducing inefficient reasoning while maintaining accuracy through adaptive extension/termination of reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in closed-loop without mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process.

Method: Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at transitional conjunction points (signaling self-validation or exploration phases) for external feedback. Feedback is generated via multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) from human or LLM proxies. The target model is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode.

Result: Think-with-Me achieves superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, it outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

Conclusion: The Think-with-Me paradigm successfully addresses inefficient reasoning in LRMs by introducing external feedback intervention at strategic points, enabling adaptive reasoning control that reduces computational cost while maintaining or improving accuracy across various task types.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

*Weihong Qi,Fan Huang,Rasika Muralidharan,Jisun An,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XChoice is an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making using mechanism-based modeling instead of just outcome metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-human alignment evaluation focuses on surface-level outcome agreement (accuracy, F1 scores), but lacks understanding of the underlying decision mechanisms and trade-offs that humans make in constrained settings.

Method: XChoice fits mechanism-based decision models to both human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters capturing decision factor importance, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups.

Result: Applied to Americans' daily time allocation using ATUS data, XChoice revealed heterogeneous alignment across models and activities, with salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. Framework robustness was validated via invariance analysis, and targeted mitigation was evaluated with RAG intervention.

Conclusion: XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching, offering a more nuanced approach to evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making.

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.

TL;DR: Probe and solve algorithm: a two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization in constraint programming solvers that outperforms default configurations using Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint programming solver performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameter settings, but manual tuning is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) probing phase explores hyperparameters using configurable optimization methods (Bayesian optimization or Hamming distance search), 2) solving phase uses best configuration found. Implemented in CPMpy library and tested on ACE and Choco solvers across 114 combinatorial instances.

Result: Bayesian optimization outperforms default configurations: improves solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances (matches default in 57.9%), and for Choco achieves superior results in 38.6% of instances. Consistently surpasses Hamming distance search.

Conclusion: Probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types, with model-based Bayesian optimization proving superior to simple local search methods.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

*Alessandro Padella,Massimiliano de Leoni,Marlon Dumas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based predictive process monitoring framework extended to evaluate generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning across multiple KPIs, showing superiority in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend prior LLM-based predictive process monitoring framework beyond total time prediction and comprehensively evaluate its capabilities across multiple key performance indicators, including understanding its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms.

Method: Extension of existing LLM-based framework using prompting techniques, evaluated across three distinct event logs and multiple KPIs (Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction), with empirical analysis in data-scarce settings (100 traces).

Result: In data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses benchmark methods. The LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and internal correlations among training traces, and performs higher-order reasoning rather than merely replicating existing predictive methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based predictive process monitoring demonstrates strong performance in data-scarce scenarios, leveraging both prior knowledge and complex reasoning strategies, making it a promising approach for predictive process monitoring across multiple KPIs.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

*Yohai Trabelsi,Guojun Xiong,Fentabil Getnet,Stéphane Verguet,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid LEG framework combines LLMs with optimization algorithms to prioritize health post upgrades in Ethiopia, balancing quantitative coverage with qualitative expert preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethiopia needs to upgrade health posts with limited resources, requiring prioritization that maximizes population coverage while incorporating diverse expert/stakeholder preferences that are often expressed in natural language rather than formal quantitative objectives.

Method: Developed the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework that combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement incorporating human-AI alignment to integrate qualitative expert guidance.

Result: Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing solutions that reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The LEG framework shows potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning by bridging the gap between formal optimization methods and qualitative stakeholder preferences expressed in natural language.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combat sports like boxing lack sophisticated AI-driven tactical analysis due to complex action dynamics and absence of structured tactical representations, creating a gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

Method: Defines atomic punch events with temporal/spatial/technical attributes, parses match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators, then uses graph-based predictive model fusing explicit indicators with learnable latent embeddings to capture matchup dynamics.

Result: Achieves 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches for outcome prediction; generates strategic recommendations comparable to human experts; validated through Olympic deployment contributing to Chinese team's 3 gold and 2 silver medals.

Conclusion: BoxMind establishes replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging computer vision and decision support in competitive sports through closed-loop AI expert system.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

Conclusion: PMC provides formal method for systematic evaluation of RAS design concepts, enabling creation of Verified Designs and addressing challenges of safety, reliability, and concept selection in complex autonomous systems.

Abstract: Safety and reliability play a crucial role when designing Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). Early consideration of hazards, risks and mitigation actions -- already in the concept study phase -- are important steps in building a solid foundations for the subsequent steps in the system engineering life cycle. The complex nature of RAS, as well as the uncertain and dynamic environments the robots operate within, do not merely effect fault management and operation robustness, but also makes the task of system design concept selection, a hard problem to address. Approaches to tackle the mentioned challenges and their implications on system design, range from ad-hoc concept development and design practices, to systematic, statistical and analytical techniques of Model Based Systems Engineering. In this paper, we propose a methodology to apply a formal method, namely Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC), to enable systematic evaluation and analysis of a given set of system design concepts, ultimately leading to a set of Verified Designs (VD). We illustrate the application of the suggested methodology -- using PRISM as probabilistic model checker -- to a practical RAS concept selection use-case from agriculture robotics. Along the way, we also develop and present a domain-specific Design Evaluation Criteria for agri-RAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wheeled-legged robots combine wheel efficiency with leg versatility but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments, requiring intelligent energy management.

Method: Hierarchical control with power prediction network forecasting energy consumption over 1-second horizon to select optimal nominal gait, plus RL policy generating residual adjustments to fine-tune actions.

Result: Method reduces energy consumption by up to 35% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance, validated through simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The integrated hierarchical framework effectively optimizes omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the versatility of legs, but face significant energy optimization challenges when navigating diverse environments. In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

### [79] [Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Vehicle Platoons with State-Dependent Friction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10724)
*Rishabh Dev Yadav*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: New adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot platoons handles unknown friction forces without prior knowledge of parameters/structure, maintaining formation despite disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot formation control applications (vehicle troops, platoons, transportation, surveillance) require handling unknown/uncertain friction forces that vary with road surface, tire wear, and speed. Existing adaptive controllers struggle with state-dependent friction forces that cannot be a priori bounded.

Method: Two-stage adaptive sliding mode controller: 1) kinematic controller calculates desired velocities from trajectory, 2) dynamics model generates motion commands. Separates kinematics and dynamics to simplify control, uses adaptive sliding mode techniques to regulate platoon speed and maintain inter-robot distance despite disturbances.

Result: Controller can handle unknown/complex friction behavior without prior knowledge of parameters/structure, maintaining formation in presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters.

Conclusion: Proposed approach enables robust formation control for wheeled mobile robot platoons by effectively managing unknown friction forces through adaptive sliding mode control with separated kinematics/dynamics architecture.

Abstract: Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.
  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical human-robot interaction needs systems that are both adaptable to user preferences and transparent about their actions to create more intuitive user experiences.

Method: Uses large language model to interpret natural language commands for modifying robot trajectories (position, velocity, force) in real time, with bidirectional verbal feedback to confirm changes or ask clarifying questions.

Result: User study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks showed participants successfully modified trajectories in real time, and bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency.

Conclusion: Verbal feedback is critical for creating more intuitive human-robot interaction experiences, and BRIDGE's bidirectional communication approach effectively enhances both adaptability and transparency in physical assistance tasks.

Abstract: Effective physical human-robot interaction requires systems that are not only adaptable to user preferences but also transparent about their actions. This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes sim-to-real training for underwater stereo depth estimation and a SLAM framework fusing stereo with IMU, barometer, and DVL, validated on shipwreck dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater stereo depth estimation is challenging due to light attenuation, visual artifacts, dynamic lighting, and lack of texture. Existing networks trained on in-air data don't transfer well, and there's a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training.

Method: 1) Sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity networks using simulated data with self-supervised finetuning. 2) Development of a real-time underwater SLAM framework (algname) that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements.

Result: Collected a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys with over 24,000 stereo pairs, dense photogrammetry models, and reference trajectories. Experiments show improved stereo estimation in underwater domain and accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

Conclusion: The proposed sim-to-real training approach effectively addresses underwater stereo estimation challenges and enables accurate SLAM for underwater robots in complex environments like shipwrecks.

Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.

### [83] [Approximately Optimal Global Planning for Contact-Rich SE(2) Manipulation on a Graph of Reachable Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10827)
*Simin Liu,Tong Zhao,Bernhard Paus Graesdal,Peter Werner,Jiuguang Wang,John Dolan,Changliu Liu,Tao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: New method for contact-rich manipulation planning that computes approximately optimal plans using offline graph construction and online planning, achieving 61% cost reduction and 91% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-based planners for contact-rich manipulation focus on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit the efficiency and naturalness advantages of using any manipulator surface for contact.

Method: Two-phase approach: offline construction of a graph of mutual reachable sets (containing all object orientations reachable from starting orientations and grasps), followed by online planning over this graph to sequence local plans for globally optimized motion.

Result: Outperforms leading planner by reducing task cost by 61%, achieves 91% success rate across 250 queries, and maintains sub-minute query times on challenging contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: Globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks, enabling more efficient and natural manipulation by fully exploiting the advantages of using any manipulator surface for contact.

Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A minimalist framework using a single low-cost IMU in crutch handgrip achieves 94% success rate for real-time gait phase and step detection for exoskeleton control, with TCN as best model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses need precise real-time gait phase and step detection for synchronized motion and user safety, but conventional methods rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency.

Method: Uses single low-cost IMU integrated into crutch hand grip (no mechanical modifications), proposes five-phase classification system including standard gait phases and non-locomotor auxiliary state, benchmarks three deep learning architectures on PC and embedded system, augments models with Finite State Machine for biomechanical consistency under data constraints.

Conclusion: The system provides a high-performance, cost-effective solution for real-time exoskeleton control using minimalist hardware approach with single IMU and effective deep learning architecture.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses require precise, real time gait phase and step detections to ensure synchronized motion and user safety. Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency. The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) emerged as the superior architecture, yielding the highest success rates and lowest latency. Notably, the model generalized to a paralyzed user despite being trained exclusively on healthy participants. Achieving a 94% success rate in detecting crutch steps, this system provides a high performance, cost effective solution for real time exoskeleton control.

### [85] [Is open robotics innovation a threat to international peace and security?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10877)
*Ludovic Righetti,Vincent Boulanin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the dual-use risks in robotics research, arguing that while open access accelerates innovation, it also lowers barriers for military/harmful applications. Unlike other fields, robotics lacks specific regulation, so the authors propose a roadmap with four practices for responsible robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open access in robotics lowers barriers to entry and supports reproducibility but also exacerbates dual-use risks by making it easier for state and non-state actors to develop robotics for military/harmful purposes. Unlike other fields (WMD-related engineering, AI), robotics lacks specific regulation and guidance for responsible research dissemination.

Method: The authors propose a roadmap focusing on four key practices: 1) education in responsible robotics, 2) incentivizing risk assessment, 3) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material, and 4) developing red lines (clear boundaries for unacceptable applications).

Result: The paper presents a structured approach to addressing dual-use risks in robotics through sector-specific guidance and potential regulation, offering a practical framework for the robotics community to develop responsible practices.

Conclusion: The robotics community needs to develop its own sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation to address dual-use risks. The proposed four-practice roadmap provides a foundation for responsible robotics research and innovation while balancing openness with security concerns.

Abstract: Open access to publication, software and hardware is central to robotics: it lowers barriers to entry, supports reproducible science and accelerates reliable system development. However, openness also exacerbates the inherent dual-use risks associated with research and innovation in robotics. It lowers barriers for states and non-state actors to develop and deploy robotics systems for military use and harmful purposes. Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation. To that end, we propose a roadmap focusing on four practices: a) education in responsible robotics; b) incentivizing risk assessment; c) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material; and d) developing red lines.

### [86] [Where to Touch, How to Contact: Hierarchical RL-MPC Framework for Geometry-Aware Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10930)
*Zhixian Xie,Yu Xiang,Michael Posa,Wanxin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical RL-MPC framework for dexterous manipulation that separates high-level contact intention planning from low-level contact dynamics optimization, achieving high success with 10x less data and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end visuomotor policies for contact-rich dexterous manipulation require large amounts of data, have poor sim-to-real transfer, and weak generalization. The paper addresses these limitations by recognizing that dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical RL-MPC framework: (1) High-level RL policy predicts contact intention (object-surface contact location + post-contact object-level subgoal pose), (2) Low-level contact-implicit MPC optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions.

Result: Achieves near-100% success on non-prehensile tasks (geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation) with 10x less data than end-to-end baselines, highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach effectively separates geometric/kinematic reasoning from contact dynamics optimization, enabling data-efficient learning, robust performance, and successful sim-to-real transfer for dexterous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in contact-rich dexterous manipulation is the need to jointly reason over geometry, kinematic constraints, and intricate, nonsmooth contact dynamics. End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

*HyoJae Kang,SunWoo Ahn,InGyu Choi,GeonYeong Go,KunWoo Son,Min-Sung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A camera module system for cranes that provides real-time visual guidance during load lowering when operators can't see landing points, improving construction site safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: During crane lowering operations, the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point, forcing reliance on verbal/gestural instructions from ground personnel, which compromises safety.

Method: Developed an attachable camera module with suction cup for mounting on loads, containing single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. The system streams and processes ground images in real-time to generate installation guidance, transmitted to a host computer for operator monitoring.

Result: Preliminary experiments with the module attached to test objects confirmed feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission, demonstrating the system's potential functionality.

Conclusion: The proposed camera guidance system has significant potential to improve construction site safety by providing crane operators with instant visual references of otherwise hidden landing zones during load lowering operations.

Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-AIM is a hierarchical multi-robot planning framework that combines LLMs, classical planners, and behavior trees to enable heterogeneous robot teams to execute complex long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches for embodied AI have limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination for executing complex tasks from high-level instructions.

Method: Three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) LLM parses instructions into PDDL problem descriptions, 2) Combines LLM semantic reasoning with classical planner search for optimized action sequences, 3) Compiles plans into behavior trees for reactive control with shared blackboard for robot coordination.

Result: H-AIM achieves dramatic performance improvements: task success rate increases from 12% to 55% and goal condition recall from 32% to 72% compared to strongest baseline LaMMA-P, validated on MACE-THOR benchmark with 42 complex tasks across 8 household layouts.

Conclusion: H-AIM effectively addresses limitations of LLM-only approaches by integrating semantic reasoning with classical planning and reactive control, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to successfully execute complex long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

Conclusion: A3D framework enables robots to perform furniture assembly more effectively by learning adaptive affordances for dual-arm coordination, generalizing across varied geometries, and dynamically adjusting support strategies based on real-time interaction feedback.

Abstract: Furniture assembly is a crucial yet challenging task for robots, requiring precise dual-arm coordination where one arm manipulates parts while the other provides collaborative support and stabilization. To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current marker-based landing approaches assume ideal conditions, limiting robustness in complex urban environments with varied lighting, weather, and layouts.

Method: Developed AirSim simulation suite with systematic variation of urban layouts, lighting, and weather conditions. Used onboard RGB camera for marker detection and depth sensor for obstacle avoidance. Benchmarked two heuristic coverage patterns against a reinforcement learning-based agent.

Result: Analysis shows how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results highlight performance differences between heuristic patterns and RL agent across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Marker-based autonomous landing must be evaluated under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to develop reliable aerial navigation systems for urban environments.

Abstract: Marker-based landing is widely used in drone delivery and return-to-base systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, most approaches assume idealized landing site visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings. We present a simulation-based evaluation suite on the AirSim platform with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather to replicate realistic operational diversity. Using onboard camera sensors (RGB for marker detection and depth for obstacle avoidance), we benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results underscore the need to evaluate marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to guide the development of reliable aerial navigation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real transfer for large hydraulic robots is challenging due to slow control response, complex fluid dynamics, and difficulty in detailed simulation for RL applications.

Method: Developed analytical actuator model based on hydraulic dynamics that predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, enabling rapid RL training.

Result: Model outperforms neural network-based alternatives in data-limited scenarios; RL-trained locomotion policy successfully deployed on 300+ kg hydraulic quadruped robot.

Conclusion: First successful demonstration of stable, robust command-tracking locomotion transfer via RL on heavy hydraulic quadruped, showing advanced sim-to-real transferability.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

TL;DR: Adaptive wildfire front monitoring using mobile agents with integrated sensing, estimation, and control via a stochastic optimal control framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat sensing, estimation, and control separately, impose restrictive assumptions, or rely on heuristics without performance guarantees for wildfire monitoring.

Method: Formulate as stochastic optimal control problem, derive optimal Bayesian estimator for nonlinear elliptical-growth fire models, transform to Markov decision process, and design information-seeking predictive control via lower confidence bound adaptive search.

Result: Developed an integrated framework with asymptotic convergence to optimal policy for adaptive wildfire front monitoring.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled solution with performance guarantees for adaptive wildfire monitoring by seamlessly integrating sensing, estimation, and control in a stochastic optimal control framework.

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Conclusion: VLAgents provides an effective solution for deploying VLAs in robotics by addressing interface fragmentation and communication latency issues, making VLA deployment more practical and efficient.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation methods improve generalization through data/network scaling but overlook skill-level information, missing shared motion patterns across tasks within the same skill.

Method: SADiff learns skill-specific representations via skill-aware encoding with learnable tokens, conditions skill-constrained diffusion models to generate object-centric motion flow, and uses skill-retrieval transformation to refine 3D actions.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating skill-level information through SADiff effectively improves robotic manipulation generalization, validated by the new IsaacSkill dataset.

Abstract: Robust generalization in robotic manipulation is crucial for robots to adapt flexibly to diverse environments. Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous uncrewed vessel fleets is challenging due to differing decision-making processes, controllers between platforms, and limitations on real-time trajectory/control value sharing.

Method: Adds a control filter on each autonomous vehicle using control barrier function (CBF) theory that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts (including crewed vessels), with clear application description for explainability.

Result: Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human-operated vessel confirm effectiveness across platforms and robustness to uncooperative human behavior. Combining CBF methods with COLREGS behaviors achieves best safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: The pragmatic distributed safety control filter using worst-case CBF theory effectively addresses collision avoidance challenges in heterogeneous fleets, with the combination of CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors providing optimal safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models use indirect reasoning (language sub-tasks or goal images) that lack granular information needed for precise action execution. The authors argue that reasoning directly in action space is more effective.

Method: Proposes ACoT-VLA with two components: Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) generates coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR) extracts latent action priors from multimodal inputs, together forming an Action Chain-of-Thought that conditions the downstream action head.

Result: Achieves 98.5% on LIBERO, 84.1% on LIBERO-Plus, and 47.4% on VLABench, demonstrating superiority over existing methods in real-world and simulation environments.

Conclusion: Action Chain-of-Thought reasoning directly in action space is more effective than indirect reasoning approaches, enabling more precise robot manipulation through structured coarse action intent sequences.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.

Conclusion: GM-100 serves as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating robotic agents and promoting diversity in task design, representing a step toward a "robot learning Olympics."

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

TL;DR: A semantic-geometric task graph representation for bimanual manipulation that captures both discrete semantic structure and temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations, enabling long-horizon action prediction and robot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon bimanual manipulation where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry vary significantly. Current approaches struggle to jointly capture discrete semantic structure and temporal geometric evolution.

Method: Introduces semantic-geometric task graph representations encoding object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution. Uses a learning framework with MPNN encoder (operating on temporal scene graphs) and Transformer-based decoder (conditioned on action-context) to decouple scene representation from action-conditioned reasoning.

Result: The semantic-geometric task graph representations outperform simpler sequence-based models, especially for tasks with high action and object variability. The representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot for online action selection.

Conclusion: Semantic-geometric task graph representations effectively capture complex manipulation behaviors and serve as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.
