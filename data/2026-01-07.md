### [1] [Self-Supervised Masked Autoencoders with Dense-Unet for Coronary Calcium Removal in limited CT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02392)
*Mo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense-MAE: A self-supervised MAE framework for 3D medical data that improves coronary calcium artifact removal and stenosis estimation in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary calcification causes blooming artifacts in CTA that hinder stenosis diagnosis. DCNNs need large labeled datasets which are scarce in medical imaging, creating a need for self-supervised approaches.

Method: Proposed Dense-MAE: a self-supervised framework using Masked Autoencoder principles for 3D medical data. Randomly masks 3D patches of vessel lumen and trains Dense-Unet to reconstruct missing geometry, forcing encoder to learn arterial topology features without human annotation.

Result: Initializing calcium removal networks with MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Dense-MAE provides an effective self-supervised pre-training strategy for volumetric medical data that enhances performance in calcium artifact removal tasks when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.

### [2] [MIAR: Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation Fuison for Multimodal Emotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02414)
*Jichao Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAR improves multimodal emotion recognition by addressing modality distribution differences and varying contributions through feature interaction tokens and contrastive learning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MER methods inadequately address significant distributional differences among modalities (language, vision, audio), don't consider varying modality contributions, and lack robust generalization across diverse textual model features, limiting performance in multimodal scenarios.

Method: MIAR (Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation) integrates contextual features across modalities using feature interaction to generate tokens representing global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. It aligns modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

Result: Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

Conclusion: MIAR effectively addresses modality distribution differences and varying contributions through feature interaction and alignment strategies, achieving superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

### [3] [Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multi-channel and Symmetric Mutual Promotion Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02415)
*Wangyuan Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal sentiment analysis method with multi-channel feature extraction and symmetric mutual promotion fusion to address limited single-modality features and inadequate inter-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal sentiment analysis has two main problems: 1) limited and insufficiently rich features from single modality data, and 2) most studies focus only on consistency between modalities while neglecting feature differences, leading to inadequate feature fusion.

Method: 1) Extract multi-channel features (dual-channel for visual and auditory modalities) for comprehensive intra-modal representation. 2) Propose symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal fusion combining symmetric cross-modal attention (captures useful info from other modalities) and self-attention (models contextual info). 3) Integrate intra-modal and inter-modal fused features to leverage both complementarity and differences between modalities.

Result: Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with multi-channel feature extraction and symmetric mutual promotion fusion effectively addresses limitations in current multimodal sentiment analysis, improving feature representation and fusion by considering both complementarity and differences between modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a key technology in the fields of human-computer interaction and affective computing. Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoT framework improves multi-modal reasoning by addressing single-region over-reliance and semantic fragmentation through dynamic multi-region grounding and relation-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought methods for multi-modal reasoning have two critical limitations: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps, which hinders effective integration of visual and linguistic cues.

Method: Proposes CoCoT (Collaborative Cross-modal Thought) framework with two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively aligning visual cues to form coherent logical chains of thought.

Result: Created CoCoT-70K dataset with 74,691 high-quality samples featuring multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Achieved significant improvements: average accuracy increase of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual reasoning by addressing key limitations of existing methods through collaborative cross-modal thought processes, with publicly available data and code for further research.

Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) framework, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively aligning visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual reasoning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.

### [6] [TAP-ViTs: Task-Adaptive Pruning for On-Device Deployment of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02437)
*Zhibo Wang,Zuoyuan Zhang,Xiaoyi Pang,Qile Zhang,Xuanyi Hao,Shuguo Zhuo,Peng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAP-ViTs is a privacy-preserving task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific Vision Transformer models without accessing raw local data, using GMM-based metric datasets and dual-granularity importance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational demands that hinder mobile/edge deployment. Existing pruning methods either produce single models ignoring device heterogeneity or require fine-tuning with local data, which violates privacy constraints and is infeasible on resource-limited devices.

Method: 1) GMM-based metric dataset construction: Devices fit lightweight Gaussian Mixture Models to approximate private data distributions and upload only GMM parameters. Cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to create task-representative metric datasets for each device. 2) Dual-granularity importance evaluation: Jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance for fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

Conclusion: TAP-ViTs enables efficient, privacy-preserving, task-adaptive pruning of Vision Transformers for heterogeneous mobile/edge devices without requiring access to raw local data, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

### [7] [Understanding Pure Textual Reasoning for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02441)
*Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Textual reasoning in BIQA has unclear contributions; three paradigms (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Autoencoder) analyzed show Self-Consistency best bridges image-text gap in quality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how textual information contributes to quality prediction in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) and determine to what extent text can represent score-related image contents, as current textual reasoning approaches lack clarity on their effectiveness.

Method: Analyzed three paradigms for learning image-text-score relationships: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder approaches, comparing them with existing BIQA models from an information-flow perspective.

Result: Existing models perform poorly with only textual information; Chain-of-Thought shows little improvement; Self-Consistency significantly reduces image-text prediction gap (PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03); Autoencoder is less effective but reveals optimization directions.

Conclusion: Self-Consistency paradigm effectively bridges the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions in BIQA, providing insights for improving textual reasoning in BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

### [8] [Evaluating the Diagnostic Classification Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Insights from the Osteoarthritis Initiative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02443)
*Li Wang,Xi Chen,XiangWen Deng,HuaHui Yi,ZeKun Jiang,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs underperform on knee OA classification vs. vision-only models; data quality beats quantity; LLMs better as interpreters than classifiers for medical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MLLMs' success in medical VQA and report generation, their performance on disease-specific classification (like knee OA affecting 300-400M people) remains unproven and underrepresented in benchmarks.

Method: Systematic ablation studies manipulating vision encoder, connector, and LLM components across diverse training strategies on knee OA radiograph classification, comparing vision-only vs. full MLLM pipelines.

Result: Vision encoder alone outperformed full MLLM pipelines; LLM fine-tuning provided no improvement over prompting; LoRA on small balanced dataset (500 images) beat training on larger imbalanced set (5,778 images).

Conclusion: For domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters/report generators than primary classifiers; MLLM architecture less suitable for high-certainty diagnostic tasks; prioritize vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.

### [9] [A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445)
*Parashjyoti Borah,Sanghamitra Sarkar,Ranjan Phukan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework treats monsoon prediction as a computer vision task, using CNN to map pre-monsoon atmospheric/oceanic fields to high-resolution gridded rainfall patterns for both monthly and seasonal forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monsoon forecasting provides only spatially-averaged seasonal values, lacking spatial detail needed for regional resource management. There's a critical gap in high-resolution, spatially-detailed predictions for the Indian Summer Monsoon that affects over a billion people.

Method: Framed gridded monsoon prediction as spatio-temporal computer vision task. Used multi-variable pre-monsoon atmospheric/oceanic fields as sequence of multi-channel images (video-like input). Employed CNN-based architecture on 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data (predictors) and IMD rainfall data (targets) to map January-May pre-monsoon period to monsoon rainfall patterns.

Result: Successfully produced distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as total seasonal average, demonstrating utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.

Conclusion: The novel deep learning framework effectively addresses the spatial detail limitation of traditional monsoon forecasting, providing high-resolution gridded rainfall predictions essential for regional-level resource management and climate adaptation.

Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.

### [10] [Don't Mind the Gaps: Implicit Neural Representations for Resolution-Agnostic Retinal OCT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02447)
*Bennet Kahrs,Julia Andresen,Fenja Falta,Monty Santarossa,Heinz Handels,Timo Kepp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INR-based frameworks for 3D retinal OCT analysis that handle anisotropic data and enable resolution-agnostic volumetric evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical OCT imaging has large slice spacing (anisotropic), forcing most methods to use 2D approaches that risk inconsistent results and cannot handle different imaging protocols. Need volumetric analysis methods that work with anisotropic data.

Method: Two INR-based frameworks: 1) Inter-B-scan interpolation using en-face modalities to retain structures between B-scans, 2) Resolution-agnostic retinal atlas for general analysis without strict data requirements. Both use generalizable implicit neural representations trained on population data.

Result: Resolution-independent frameworks that facilitate analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, enabling volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

Conclusion: INR-based approaches overcome limitations of 2D methods for anisotropic OCT data, providing consistent 3D analysis and opening possibilities for volumetric retinal evaluation across different imaging protocols.

Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D encoder model produces language-aligned patch features directly from point clouds for zero-shot part segmentation without multi-view rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D foundation models are good at global tasks but poor at local part-level reasoning. Existing approaches require expensive multi-view rendering, depend on LLM prompt engineering, and fail to exploit 3D geometry.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: (1) distill dense 2D features from visual encoders (DINOv2) into 3D patches, (2) align patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings using multi-positive contrastive objective. Uses existing data engines with part-annotated 3D shapes from multi-view SAM regions and VLM captioning.

Result: Achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference (no test-time multi-view rendering). Significantly outperforms previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed encoder-only 3D model enables efficient, geometry-aware part-level reasoning without expensive rendering or LLM dependencies, advancing 3D foundation models for local tasks.

Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

*Amirreza Parvahan,Mohammad Hoseyni,Javad Khoramdel,Amirhossein Nikoofard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight 3D medical imaging framework reformulates CT scans as video streams for efficient intracranial hemorrhage detection on edge devices, using YOLO backbones with ByteTrack for anatomical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volumetric medical imaging analysis on edge devices is constrained by high memory/computational demands of 3D CNNs. Need efficient solution for time-sensitive intracranial hemorrhage detection in resource-constrained environments like mobile stroke units.

Method: Reformulate CT data as sequential video streams. Benchmark YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11, v12 Nano) for slice-level detection. Use ByteTrack for anatomical consistency across z-axis. Implement hybrid inference strategy and spatiotemporal consistency filter to address tracker initialization lag.

Result: Framework increases detection precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to baseline 2D detector while maintaining high sensitivity. Serves as rigorous temporal validator, approximating 3D contextual reasoning at fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: Video-viewpoint paradigm provides scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments by reconciling 2D efficiency with 3D context needs for volumetric medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.

*Shaden Shaar,Bradon Thymes,Sirawut Chaixanien,Claire Cardie,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MovieRecapsQA: A novel open-ended multimodal VideoQA benchmark using movie recap videos with ≈8.2K QA pairs, featuring explicit textual context for reference-free evaluation and enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture complex multimodal reasoning needed for real-world videos like movies, and are largely not open-ended due to difficulties in evaluating free-form answers.

Method: Created benchmark using movie recap videos from YouTube, generating QA pairs aligned with movie subtitles from recap summaries, providing necessary "facts" for reference-free evaluation, and categorizing questions by modality and type.

Result: Evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows: 1) visual-only questions remain most challenging, 2) models default to textual inputs when available, 3) extracting accurate information from video is difficult for all models, and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

Conclusion: MovieRecapsQA is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark with explicit textual context, enabling comprehensive evaluation of multimodal reasoning in video understanding and revealing current limitations in visual information extraction.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach combining Vision Mamba and Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) for localizing manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image manipulation localization is critical due to societal impacts of forged images. While many methods focus on either shallowfakes (traditional editing) or deepfake videos, few address both shallow- and deep-fake image localization, creating a research gap.

Method: Uses Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps highlighting boundaries between tampered and authentic regions, then enhances separation with a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module to amplify distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in localizing manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenge of localizing manipulations across both shallowfake and deepfake images using a combination of Vision Mamba and G-GNN, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Aniruddha Mahapatra,Long Mai,Cusuh Ham,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLoop is a controllable video synthesis framework that generates cinemagraphs from single photos without specialized training data, using temporal bridging and motion conditioning to create seamless loops with user-controlled motion paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-animation techniques are limited to simple motions in narrow domains like water/smoke, while video diffusion models aren't designed for cinemagraph constraints and lack specialized data for seamless loops. There's a need for controllable cinemagraph generation from single photos for general scenes.

Method: Adapts a general video diffusion model with two training objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. During inference: uses input image as both first- and last-frame condition for seamless loops; conditions on static tracks to maintain static background; uses user-specified motion paths for target objects to control animation trajectory and timing.

Result: Produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches. First method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls.

Conclusion: DreamLoop successfully addresses the challenge of controllable cinemagraph generation from single photos without requiring specialized training data, enabling flexible and intuitive creation of seamless looping animations for general scenes.

Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.

*Shuman He,Xiehua Li,Xioaju Yang,Yang Xiong,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRRE uses green channel removal and reconstruction error analysis to detect AI-generated images with strong cross-model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative models, creating a need for more robust forensic tools as generative AI advances.

Method: Remove green channel from images, reconstruct it, and analyze reconstruction errors - real and AI-generated images show significantly different error patterns, enabling detection via G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE).

Result: GRRE achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models (including unseen ones), maintains robustness against perturbations/post-processing, and shows superior cross-model generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Channel-removal-based reconstruction (particularly GRRE) is a powerful forensic tool for AI-generated image detection with strong generalization capabilities, offering practical value for safeguarding image authenticity.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.

Conclusion: CAMO enables visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision, effectively addressing shape-pose ambiguities.

Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.

*Guoquan Zheng,Jie Hao,Huiyu Duan,Yongming Han,Liang Yuan,Dong Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a robust framework for 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition using view cone sampling and hybrid manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion to address limitations of current VR eye-tracking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition methods ignore differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image arrays. VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, causing texture attention bias and signal leakage across gaps.

Method: 1) View cone sampling (VCS) strategy using Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to simulate human foveal receptive field. 2) Hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm that fuses manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales for topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

Result: The framework mitigates "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, providing high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition that aligns with natural human perception, offering more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

Conclusion: Proposed framework addresses limitations of current methods by better simulating human visual perception in 3D environments, providing more reliable ground truth for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

### [19] [Foreground-Aware Dataset Distillation via Dynamic Patch Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02727)
*Longzhen Li,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foreground-aware dataset distillation method using Grounded SAM2 for object detection and dynamic patch selection to preserve key object information while reducing background redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset distillation methods have high computational costs, generate unrealistic images, and suffer from limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods using rigid patch selection discard critical object information.

Method: Uses Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, derives category-wise patch decision thresholds, and implements dynamic patch selection that either selects the most informative patch or resizes full images when foreground dominates.

Result: Consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, produces more informative and representative distilled datasets, and enhances robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed foreground-aware dataset distillation method effectively preserves key object information while reducing background redundancy, addressing limitations of previous approaches and improving overall distillation quality and generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

*Xuchang Zhong,Xu Cao,Jinke Feng,Hao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A homography-guided pose estimator network for visual localization between multi-view images and SD maps that uses geometric priors to improve training efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based approaches for visual localization on SD maps often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy.

Method: Construct input pairs satisfying homography constraints by projecting ground-view features into BEV domain, enforce semantic alignment with map features, leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion, and restrict pose outputs to valid feasible regions.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods on nuScenes dataset, with improved training efficiency and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: First work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization; explicit homography modeling supports cross-resolution inputs and enhances model flexibility.

Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs have a functional perception gap in PET imaging, causing CoT hallucinations; PET-Bench benchmark reveals this, and AVA fine-tuning fixes it, improving accuracy by 14.83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel in anatomical imaging but lack capability in functional imaging like PET, where they fail to interpret tracer biodistribution without morphological biases. There's a need to understand and address this functional perception gap.

Method: Created PET-Bench (52,308 QA pairs from 9,732 PET studies) to benchmark MLLMs. Identified CoT hallucination trap. Proposed AVA (Atomic Visual Alignment) fine-tuning that forces models to master low-level functional perception before high-level reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 19 SOTA MLLMs revealed critical CoT hallucinations in PET. AVA successfully bridged the perception gap, transformed CoT into reliable inference, and improved diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Conclusion: Functional imaging requires different perception capabilities than anatomical imaging. AVA fine-tuning effectively addresses the functional perception gap in MLLMs, making them safer and more accurate for PET diagnosis.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

TL;DR: BUFFER-X is a training-free point cloud registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse environments without manual tuning or retraining, addressing limitations of existing deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. Three critical limitations identified: fixed user-defined parameters that fail across scales, poor cross-domain transferability of learned keypoint detectors, and absolute coordinates amplifying scale mismatches.

Method: BUFFER-X uses: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization for scale consistency. Employs hierarchical multi-scale matching across local, middle, and global receptive fields. BUFFER-X-Lite variant adds early exit strategies and fast pose solvers for 43% faster computation.

Conclusion: BUFFER-X provides a training-free registration framework that achieves robust zero-shot generalization across diverse environments, addressing key limitations of existing deep learning methods through automatic parameter estimation, distribution-aware sampling, and scale normalization.

Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods rely on large datasets and complex decoders, limiting efficiency and generalization. Need for lightweight, data-efficient approach.

Method: 1) Use DINOv3 as visual encoder for dense features. 2) Design Simple Depth Transformer (SDT) decoder with single-path feature fusion/upsampling (85-89% parameter reduction vs DPT). 3) Quality-based filtering strategy to remove harmful training samples.

Result: Framework outperforms DPT in accuracy on five benchmarks while being much more parameter-efficient. Achieves better zero-shot depth estimation with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: Balancing model design and data quality is crucial for efficient, generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Lightweight architecture with data filtering enables better performance with fewer resources.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClearAIR is an All-in-One Image Restoration framework inspired by Human Visual Perception, using hierarchical coarse-to-fine restoration with MLLM-based quality assessment, region awareness, and internal clue reuse for superior performance on complex degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. The authors aim to address these limitations by developing a more robust framework that can handle complex, composite degradations in real-world scenarios.

Method: ClearAIR uses a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy: 1) MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment for overall evaluation with cross-modal understanding, 2) Region awareness and task recognition pipeline with semantic cross-attention and degradation-aware modules, 3) Internal clue reuse mechanism for self-supervised fine detail restoration.

Result: Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing approaches in handling complex degradations.

Conclusion: ClearAIR successfully addresses limitations of existing AiOIR methods by incorporating Human Visual Perception principles and hierarchical restoration, demonstrating effectiveness in handling complex real-world image degradations.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Boyu Chang,Qi Wang,Xi Guo,Zhixiong Nan,Yazhou Yao,Tianfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AbductiveMLLM enhances multimodal LLMs for visual abductive reasoning by combining verbal reasoning with pictorial imagination, achieving SOTA performance on VAR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack strong abductive inference capabilities compared to humans, despite having general multimodal reasoning abilities. The paper aims to bridge this gap by mimicking human dual-mode cognition that combines verbal and pictorial abduction.

Method: Proposes AbductiveMLLM with two components: REASONER (verbal domain) that explores explanations using blind LLM, prunes visually incongruent hypotheses, and introduces targeted priors; and IMAGINER (pictorial domain) that uses text-to-image diffusion to "imagine" visual scenes corresponding to verbal explanations. Both components are trained end-to-end.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard VAR benchmarks, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: Mimicking human dual-mode cognition (verbal + pictorial abduction) effectively enhances MLLMs' abductive reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of integrating both reasoning modes for visual abductive tasks.

Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth vision has focused on object recognition but lacks object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding needed for applications like city planning.

Method: Progressive framework with EarthVLNet: 1) Land-cover segmentation for object semantics, 2) Object-aware LLM for relational reasoning and knowledge summarization, 3) Numerical difference loss for optimization. Uses EarthVLSet dataset with 10.9k images and 761.5k text pairs.

Result: Superior performance on three benchmarks (semantic segmentation, multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA). Key findings: segmentation features enhance VQA, multiple-choice tasks sensitive to vision encoder, open-ended tasks need advanced vision and language models.

Conclusion: The framework advances Earth vision by connecting image-mask-text, providing a benchmark for geographical applications and enabling comprehensive scene understanding through progressive semantic segmentation and relational reasoning.

Abstract: Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.

### [28] [DreamStyle: A Unified Framework for Video Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02785)
*Mengtian Li,Jinshu Chen,Songtao Zhao,Wanquan Feng,Pengqi Tu,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamStyle is a unified video stylization framework supporting text, image, and first-frame guidance with improved style consistency and reduced flicker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods are limited to single style conditions (text, image, or first frame only) and suffer from style inconsistency and temporal flicker due to lack of high-quality datasets.

Method: Built on vanilla Image-to-Video model with data curation pipeline; uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices to reduce confusion among different condition tokens.

Result: DreamStyle outperforms competitors in style consistency and video quality across all three video stylization tasks (text-guided, style-image-guided, first-frame-guided).

Conclusion: DreamStyle provides a unified framework that addresses limitations of existing methods by supporting multiple style conditions while improving temporal consistency and visual quality.

Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.

### [29] [Textile IR: A Bidirectional Intermediate Representation for Physics-Aware Fashion CAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02792)
*Petteri Teikari,Neliana Fuenmayor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Textile IR is a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects CAD, physics simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design, enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fashion design tools are siloed - pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but doesn't understand drape, while physics simulation predicts behavior but can't automatically fix patterns. There's also a compound uncertainty problem where measurement errors, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine to make sustainability claims unreliable.

Method: Textile IR uses a seven-layer Verification Ladder from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). It formalizes fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and uses a scene-graph representation that enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs.

Result: The framework enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. It makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential.

Conclusion: Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integrating fashion design tools, enabling designers to navigate tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping. The paper proposes six research priorities and discusses deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialized engineering requirements.

Abstract: We introduce Textile IR, a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects manufacturing-valid CAD, physics-based simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design. Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableDPT adapts image-based depth estimation models for video by adding temporal layers with cross-attention to keyframes, achieving temporal stability and faster processing without overlapping windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models applied to video sequences suffer from temporal instability and flickering artifacts, creating poor viewing experiences.

Method: Builds on Vision Transformer encoder and DPT head, adding temporal layers with efficient cross-attention to integrate information from keyframes across entire video sequences, plus novel inference strategy for arbitrary-length videos.

Result: Improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance, and 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: StableDPT successfully adapts image-based depth models for video with temporal stability, global context awareness, and efficient processing for practical applications.

Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.

*Mingzhou Jiang,Jiaying Zhou,Nan Zeng,Mickael Li,Qijie Tang,Chao He,Huazhu Fu,Honghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel topology-aware framework for virtual staining that converts H&E images to IHC images using graph contrastive learning and topological constraints to handle spatial misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is crucial for cancer diagnosis but is complex, time-consuming, and expensive compared to H&E staining. Virtual staining offers a cost-effective alternative, but existing methods suffer from weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations when using adjacent slides as ground truth.

Method: Proposes a topology-aware framework with two key mechanisms: 1) Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) using graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, and 2) Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-aware framework effectively addresses the challenges of spatial misalignment in virtual staining, providing a robust solution for converting H&E images to IHC images with improved clinical utility.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Dongzhan Zhou,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchThinker-R1 reduces multimodal model reasoning token costs by 64%+ while maintaining accuracy by teaching sketch-style reasoning inspired by human cognitive efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long step-by-step reasoning in multimodal models causes high computational overhead (token costs, response time), while humans use efficient sketch-style reasoning that prioritizes key information.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Sketch-Mode Cold Start - convert long reasoning to sketch-style and finetune base model, 2) Train SketchJudge Reward Model to evaluate thinking processes and favor sketch-style reasoning, 3) Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning supervised by SketchJudge to generalize sketch-style reasoning ability.

Result: Achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token costs without compromising final answer accuracy across four benchmarks. Qualitative analysis shows sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

Conclusion: SketchThinker-R1 successfully incentivizes sketch-style reasoning in multimodal models, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating the value of human-inspired cognitive approaches for AI efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

*Yuetong Li,Qing Zhang,Yilin Zhao,Gongyang Li,Zeming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGA-Net adapts SAM for camouflaged object detection using dense depth prompts, with cross-modal graph enhancement and anchor-guided refinement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully exploit depth cues in camouflaged object detection, as existing methods rely on sparse prompts (points/boxes) rather than dense depth information.

Method: Introduces dense depth prompting paradigm with Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module to synthesize RGB semantics and depth geometry, and Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module to broadcast guidance from deep to shallow layers via global anchor and non-local pathways.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show DGA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art COD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DGA-Net framework successfully adapts SAM for COD through dense depth prompting, achieving superior performance by effectively integrating depth cues with RGB information.

Abstract: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), we present DGA-Net, a specialized framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via a novel ``depth prompting" paradigm. Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.

*Yuteng Liu,Duanni Meng,Maoxun Yuan,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEF-DETR improves infrared small target detection by addressing self-attention's tendency to overwhelm target features with background noise, using frequency-guided patch screening, dynamic embedding enhancement, and reliability-consistency fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based detectors suffer performance degradation in IRSTD because self-attention mechanisms cause target-relevant embeddings to be overwhelmed by dominant background features, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization.

Method: Proposes SEF-DETR with three components: 1) Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS) uses Fourier spectrum of local patches to create target-relevant density maps and suppress background features; 2) Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE) strengthens multi-scale representations in target-aware manner; 3) Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF) refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets show SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, providing robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: SEF-DETR effectively addresses the limitations of DETR-based detectors in IRSTD by refining query initialization through frequency analysis and reliability-aware fusion, offering a promising approach for challenging infrared small target detection scenarios.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.

*Jakob Lønborg Christensen,Morten Rieger Hannemose,Anders Bjorholm Dahl,Vedrana Andersen Dahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based universal image segmentation framework that predicts full segmentation holistically without mask-based approaches, using location-aware palette with 2D gray code ordering and tanh activation for discrete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal image segmentation framework that doesn't depend on mask-based architectures, enabling holistic segmentation prediction and principled ambiguity modeling that current mask-based models lack.

Method: Diffusion-based framework with key adaptations: location-aware palette with 2D gray code ordering, tanh activation for discrete data, sigmoid loss weighting, and x-prediction optimization.

Result: Narrows performance gap with leading mask-based architectures while introducing unique capabilities like principled ambiguity modeling. Current model doesn't surpass state-of-the-art mask-based models but shows promising direction.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show potential for universal image segmentation when combined with proposed improvements. Future work with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TA-Prompting enhances VideoLLMs with Temporal Anchors for precise event localization and temporal-aware video understanding, plus event coherent sampling for caption generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs struggle with identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing generated captions to lack proper temporal grounding.

Method: Proposes TA-Prompting with Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt VideoLLMs for temporal-aware understanding, plus event coherent sampling strategy for caption selection.

Result: Superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks (moment retrieval and temporalQA) compared to state-of-the-art VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: TA-Prompting effectively addresses temporal grounding challenges in VideoLLMs, improving both event localization and caption generation for dense video understanding.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA methods either provide numerical scores without explanation or low-level descriptions without precise scores. Recent VLM-based IQA methods show potential but suffer from unreliable reasoning due to limited integration of visual and textual cues.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Supervised fine-tuning on Grounded-Rationale-IQA dataset to teach region grounding, and 2) Reinforcement learning with KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning diversity collapse and Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias.

Result: Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization in image quality assessment. Application to downstream tasks like image restoration demonstrates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed Zoom-IQA model successfully addresses limitations of previous IQA methods by emulating key cognitive behaviors, resulting in more reliable and explainable quality assessments that generalize well to practical applications.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.

*Aihua Zheng,Ya Gao,Shihao Li,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCG-ReID proposes disentangled fusion strategies for multi-modal vehicle ReID, using dynamic confidence weighting to handle both balanced and unbalanced quality distributions across RGB, NIR, and TIR modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal vehicle ReID methods use a single fusion model for all data, failing to address the different needs of balanced vs. unbalanced quality distributions and the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes DCG-ReID with: 1) Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) to reweight modal contributions, 2) Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) for balanced distributions to mine shared discriminative features, and 3) Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) for unbalanced distributions to amplify dominant modality advantages and guide auxiliary modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: DCG-ReID successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID by disentangling heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data and providing scenario-specific fusion strategies, improving performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: PrismVAU is a lightweight system for Video Anomaly Understanding that uses a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization without fine-tuning or external modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Anomaly Understanding approaches rely on fine-tuned MLLMs or external modules, which require costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. There's a need for a more efficient, practical solution for real-world applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) coarse anomaly scoring via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) MLLM-based refinement with system/user prompts. Uses weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) to optimize textual anchors and prompts without instruction tuning or frame-level annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks show competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations. The system achieves this without instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, external modules, or dense processing.

Conclusion: PrismVAU provides an efficient and practical solution for real-time Video Anomaly Understanding, offering competitive performance with interpretable explanations while being lightweight and suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridSolarNet integrates EfficientNet-B0 with CBAM for lightweight solar panel fault detection from UAV imagery, achieving 92.37% accuracy with 16.3MB model size and 54.9 FPS inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual solar panel inspections are tedious, costly, and error-prone. Existing deep learning methods are either too large for edge devices or suffer from biased accuracy estimation due to ineffective learning techniques.

Method: Proposes HybridSolarNet combining EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Uses split-before-augmentation protocol to avoid data leakage, implements focal loss for class imbalance, and applies cosine annealing. Tested on Kaggle Solar Panel Images dataset with 5-fold stratified cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 92.37% ± 0.41 accuracy and F1-score of 0.9226 ± 0.39, requiring only 16.3 MB storage (32× smaller than VGG19). Inference speed of 54.9 FPS with GPU support. CBAM provides +1.53% accuracy boost, and focal loss helps with imbalanced classes. Grad-CAM visualizations show model focuses on relevant panel areas.

Conclusion: HybridSolarNet is a lightweight, accurate, and fast fault detection model suitable for real-time UAV implementation, addressing both computational constraints and accuracy estimation issues in solar panel monitoring.

Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.

Conclusion: VTONQA dataset and benchmarks provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both quality assessment method development and advancement of VTON models in e-commerce and digital fashion.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce and digital fashion, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) has attracted increasing attention. However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image editing with diffusion models struggles to balance content preservation with edit application and handle real-image editing effectively.

Method: Leverages intermediate states from inversion process during edited image generation, combining latent representations and attention maps via weighted interpolation controlled by a scheduler (LAMS). Integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to support precise editing with region masks and style transfer via LoRA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

Conclusion: LAMS-Edit provides an extensible framework for precise text-to-image editing that successfully addresses the content preservation vs. edit application trade-off in diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image editing using diffusion models faces challenges in balancing content preservation with edit application and handling real-image editing. To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

TL;DR: ULS+ enhances the Universal Lesion Segmentation model by incorporating new public datasets and smaller input sizes, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference, and top performance on the ULS23 Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the original ULS model by leveraging newly available public datasets and optimizing input parameters for better clinical lesion segmentation performance.

Method: Enhanced ULS model (ULS+) incorporating additional public datasets and using smaller input image sizes while maintaining the same click-point VOI approach for whole-body CT lesion segmentation.

Result: ULS+ significantly outperformed original ULS on Dice score and click-point robustness on ULS23 Challenge test data and Longitudinal-CT subset, ranking first on ULS23 Challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: ULS+ establishes a foundation for robust, clinically relevant lesion segmentation through data-driven updates and clinical validation cycles.

Abstract: In this study, we present ULS+, an enhanced version of the Universal Lesion Segmentation (ULS) model. The original ULS model segments lesions across the whole body in CT scans given volumes of interest (VOIs) centered around a click-point. Since its release, several new public datasets have become available that can further improve model performance. ULS+ incorporates these additional datasets and uses smaller input image sizes, resulting in higher accuracy and faster inference.
  We compared ULS and ULS+ using the Dice score and robustness to click-point location on the ULS23 Challenge test data and a subset of the Longitudinal-CT dataset. In all comparisons, ULS+ significantly outperformed ULS. Additionally, ULS+ ranks first on the ULS23 Challenge test-phase leaderboard. By maintaining a cycle of data-driven updates and clinical validation, ULS+ establishes a foundation for robust and clinically relevant lesion segmentation models.

*Chengcheng Feng,Haojie Yin,Yucheng Jin,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel comic reasoning framework improves small MLLMs' performance on comic-based VQA by addressing CoT limitations through modular generation and reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting degrades performance in comic-based VQA due to state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, especially in small models.

Method: Proposes a comic reasoning framework combining modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward mechanism.

Result: The 3B model outperforms SOTA methods across five benchmarks, with plug-in experiments showing 12.1% average improvement across different MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CoT limitations in comic reasoning, enabling small MLLMs to achieve superior performance on humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.

*Li Wang,Boqi Li,Hang Chen,Xingjian Wu,Yichen Wang,Jiewen Tan,Xinyu Zhang,Huaping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiSe is a VICP framework that selectively transmits only risk-critical BEV features using potential field risk assessment and intention prediction, reducing bandwidth to 0.71% while maintaining SOTA detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICP frameworks inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions, creating a bottleneck between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy. Existing approaches using spatial compression or static confidence maps don't effectively prioritize risk-critical areas.

Method: RiSe introduces: 1) PTCM using potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks, 2) IDAPM leveraging ego-motion priors to predict key BEV areas for decision-making, and 3) semantic-selective fusion that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on DeepAccident dataset show RiSe reduces communication volume to 0.71% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

Conclusion: RiSe successfully shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones, effectively acting as a feature denoiser that optimizes the trade-off between communication bandwidth and perception performance in VICP systems.

Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

*Yihan Wei,Shenghai Yuan,Tianchen Deng,Boyang Lou,Enwen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCCur is a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels for corner-case scenarios using a multi-agent recursive pipeline with minimal human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases (rare/extreme scenarios) drive real-world failures but are difficult to curate at scale due to noisy web data, brittle labels, and edge deployment constraints that preclude large retraining.

Method: Three-stage recursive pipeline: 1) Large-scale data acquisition/filtering with VLMs and tri-modal consistency checks; 2) Mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation with complementary encoders and uncertainty sampling; 3) Region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling with proposer-validator pairs for explainable labels.

Result: Runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, requires minimal human supervision, and provides practical substrate for downstream training/evaluation under resource constraints.

Conclusion: ReCCur offers a practical solution for scalable corner-case curation from noisy web data, enabling better training and evaluation of models in resource-constrained edge deployments.

Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-ResGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for active scene reconstruction by stabilizing uncertainty quantification and enhancing supervision through self-augmented point clouds and residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in next-best-view selection for active scene reconstruction: unreliable uncertainty quantification, under-supervised Gaussians due to sparse/wide-baseline views, and conflicting effects of exploration vs. sparse-view ambiguity.

Method: 1) Self-augmented point clouds via triangulation between training and extrapolated views for coverage estimation; 2) Residual learning for 3D Gaussian Splatting with uncertainty-driven filtering and dropout/hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling; 3) Physically guided view selection strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness for active view selection tasks.

Conclusion: SA-ResGS provides a comprehensive framework that improves uncertainty quantification, enhances supervision for under-supervised Gaussians, and achieves better reconstruction and view selection through physically grounded view selection and residual learning.

Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

*Han Zhang,Yanwei Wang,Fang Li,Hongjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFRCP is a plug-in module for YOLOv11 that enhances blur-robust object detection by combining multi-scale features with adaptive fuzzy feature injection, achieving 10.4% higher accuracy on blurred images with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake degrades object detection performance. Existing approaches either treat blur as noise (losing structure) or use full image restoration (increasing latency), making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: DFRCP enhances YOLOv11's feature pyramid by combining large and medium scale features while preserving native representations. It introduces Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features (synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multi-scale features) through a transparency convolution that learns content-adaptive trade-offs. Includes CUDA parallel rotation/interpolation kernel for 400x speedup.

Result: On blurred test sets using a private wheat pest damage dataset (3,500 images, 3x augmented with uniform motion blur and bounding-box rotational blur), YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves ~10.4% higher accuracy than YOLOv11 baseline with modest training time overhead.

Conclusion: DFRCP provides an effective plug-in solution for blur-robust object detection that balances accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection while being practical for edge deployment.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.

### [49] [Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030)
*Ali Kashefi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two new geometric deep learning frameworks (Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet) predict fluid flow variables on irregular geometries using PointNet with flow matching and diffusion models, outperforming vanilla PointNet on accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting fluid flow on irregular geometries face limitations: pixelation approaches project geometries onto uniform lattices, while graph neural network-based diffusion models produce high-frequency noise artifacts and require complex auxiliary networks for geometry conditioning.

Method: Two frameworks incorporate PointNet into generative models: Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet. Both use reverse generative processes to reconstruct physical fields from Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries, operating directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains without pixelation.

Result: The frameworks achieve more accurate predictions of velocity/pressure fields and lift/drag forces, show greater robustness to incomplete geometries, and avoid high-frequency noise artifacts compared to vanilla PointNet with same parameter count.

Conclusion: Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet provide simple, unified architectures for accurate fluid flow prediction on irregular geometries, overcoming limitations of pixelation and graph neural network approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.

*Siyi Lyu,Quan Liu,Feng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs fail at spatial reasoning due to architectural complexity limitations, not just data scale. They can't efficiently represent non-solvable spatial transformations like 3D rotations due to computational complexity boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers excel at semantic recognition but systematically fail at spatial reasoning tasks like mental rotation. The paper aims to explain this limitation not as a data scale issue but as an intrinsic architectural constraint related to computational complexity.

Method: Formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism that preserves algebraic structure of transformation groups. Analyze computational complexity: show that representing non-solvable groups (like SO(3)) requires solving the Word Problem (NC¹-complete), while constant-depth ViTs are bounded by TC⁰. Validate with latent-space probing to show structural collapse in ViT representations.

Result: Established a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. Validated the complexity gap through latent-space probing, showing ViT representations suffer structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

Conclusion: The spatial reasoning limitations of Vision Transformers stem from intrinsic architectural complexity constraints, not just data scale. Under the TC⁰ ⊊ NC¹ conjecture, constant-depth ViTs cannot efficiently represent non-solvable spatial transformations like 3D rotations, explaining their systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

TL;DR: IBISAgent: An agentic MLLM that reformulates medical image segmentation as multi-step decision-making with iterative refinement, outperforming SOTA methods without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLM segmentation approaches have two major limitations: 1) They require simultaneous fine-tuning of MLLMs and external pixel decoders, risking catastrophic forgetting and poor out-of-domain generalization; 2) They rely on single-pass reasoning without iterative refinement capability, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: IBISAgent reformulates segmentation as vision-centric multi-step decision-making. It enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. Uses two-stage training: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source state-of-the-art methods on medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: IBISAgent provides an effective agentic approach to medical image segmentation that supports iterative refinement, avoids catastrophic forgetting, and enhances generalization without requiring architectural changes to MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.

*Chenchen Lin,Sanbao Su,Rachel Luo,Yuxiao Chen,Yan Wang,Marco Pavone,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGIF introduces a lightweight text-guided inter-layer fusion module that dynamically combines visual features from different encoder layers based on the query, reducing hallucinations and improving visual grounding in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs under-utilize the rich hierarchy of visual features in frozen vision encoders, relying on single late-layer features and suffering from visually ungrounded hallucinations that depend more on language priors than image evidence.

Method: TGIF treats vision encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features using a lightweight module that follows direct external fusion principles, requiring no vision-encoder updates and adding minimal overhead.

Result: Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Conclusion: Query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs, demonstrating the value of dynamic multi-layer feature utilization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach with Xception model, adversarial training, and Grad-CAM visualization provides an effective, robust, and interpretable solution for grape leaf disease classification, with practical deployment through a user-friendly web application for agricultural use.

Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease. Finally deployed a web application using Streamlit with a heatmap visualization and prediction with confidence level for robust grape leaf disease classification.

*Zhen Wang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Qilong Wang,Yongfeng Dong,Wenlong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFSG proposes a concept-feature structuralization approach for fine-grained domain generalization by disentangling representations into common, specific, and confounding components with adaptive adjustment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained domain generalization is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Current models become overly sensitive to fine-grained cues under domain shifts, suppressing critical features. Humans use both common and specific attributes for fine-grained classification, but deep learning models haven't effectively incorporated this mechanism.

Method: Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG) explicitly disentangles both concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. It introduces an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust component proportions based on distribution shifts, and assigns explicit weights to each component pair in final predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets show CFSG achieves average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by average of 3.08%. Explainability analysis validates effective integration of multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms feature structuralization facilitates concept structuralization emergence.

Conclusion: CFSG successfully addresses fine-grained domain generalization challenges by mimicking human cognitive mechanisms through structured disentanglement of concepts and features, with adaptive component adjustment and explicit weighting strategies that significantly improve performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.

### [55] [Unified Thinker: A General Reasoning Modular Core for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03127)
*Sashuai Zhou,Qiang Zhou,Jijin Hu,Hanqing Yang,Yue Cao,Junpeng Ma,Yinchao Ma,Jun Song,Tiezheng Ge,Cheng Yu,Bo Zheng,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Thinker is a reasoning architecture that separates planning from generation to improve logic-intensive image synthesis, using reinforcement learning to ground plans in visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, creating a reasoning-execution gap. While closed-source systems show strong reasoning-driven generation, open-source models lag behind. The paper argues that better visual generators alone aren't enough - executable reasoning that decomposes intents into verifiable plans is needed.

Method: Proposes Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture with a dedicated Thinker decoupled from the image Generator. Uses two-stage training: first builds structured planning interface for the Thinker, then applies reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, optimizing visual correctness over textual plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality, closing the gap between open-source and closed-source reasoning-driven systems.

Conclusion: Closing the reasoning-execution gap requires executable reasoning, not just better generators. Unified Thinker's modular architecture enables reasoning upgrades without retraining entire models, and reinforcement learning with visual feedback effectively grounds plans for improved image synthesis.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

TL;DR: Multi-agent LLM framework for cartoon VQA addresses challenges in interpreting stylised imagery through collaborative visual, language, and critic agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs trained on natural images struggle with cartoon VQA due to exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Proposed multi-agent LLM framework with three specialized agents: visual agent (processes visual cues), language agent (handles text), and critic agent (integrates both), working collaboratively for structured reasoning.

Result: Systematically evaluated on Pororo and Simpsons cartoon VQA datasets, with detailed analysis showing how each agent contributes to final predictions.

Conclusion: The framework provides deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behavior in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference, addressing unique challenges of stylised imagery.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for stylised cartoon imagery presents challenges, such as interpreting exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, which are not adequately addressed by standard large language models (LLMs) trained on natural images. To investigate this issue, a multi-agent LLM framework is introduced, specifically designed for VQA tasks in cartoon imagery. The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnatomiX is a multimodal LLM for chest X-ray interpretation that uses anatomical grounding to improve spatial reasoning, achieving 25%+ performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal medical LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding in chest X-ray interpretation, lacking true anatomical correspondence despite existing grounding techniques.

Method: Two-stage approach inspired by radiological workflow: 1) identifies anatomical structures and extracts features, 2) uses LLM for downstream tasks (phrase grounding, report generation, VQA, image understanding).

Result: Achieves superior anatomical reasoning with over 25% improvement in anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis, and grounded captioning tasks across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: AnatomiX effectively addresses anatomical understanding gaps in medical LLMs through explicit anatomical grounding, significantly improving chest X-ray interpretation performance.

Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCorn is a self-improvement framework that addresses "Conduction Aphasia" in Unified Multimodal Models by partitioning a single model into three collaborative roles (Proposer, Solver, Judge) to enhance text-to-image generation quality without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified Multimodal Models excel at cross-modal comprehension but struggle to translate that understanding into high-quality generation, a gap formalized as "Conduction Aphasia" - where models can interpret multimodal inputs but can't synthesize faithful outputs.

Method: UniCorn partitions a single UMM into three roles: Proposer (generates initial outputs), Solver (refines outputs), and Judge (evaluates quality). Uses self-play to generate high-quality interactions and cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on TIIF (73.8), DPG (86.8), CompBench (88.5), and UniCycle benchmark. Delivers substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. Shows comprehensive improvements across six general image generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniCorn significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence and effectively addressing the Conduction Aphasia problem.

Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.

Result: Shows strong generalization across tissues on PanNuke and MoNuSeg datasets, achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with over 5x speed improvement compared to next-fastest leading method.

Conclusion: LSP-DETR provides precise, scalable, and efficient instance segmentation for computational pathology without sacrificing context or requiring handcrafted post-processing.

Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

Motivation: Diffusion models have computational overhead from multi-step inference, hindering real-world deployment. Combining multiple acceleration techniques is challenging, requiring automated solutions.

Method: 1) DiffBench: comprehensive benchmark with 3-stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimizations, and deployment scenarios. 2) DiffAgent: LLM agent with closed-loop workflow (planning, code generation, debugging components) and genetic algorithm for performance feedback-guided refinement.

Result: DiffBench provides thorough evaluation of generated acceleration codes. DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-driven framework successfully addresses the challenge of automated diffusion model acceleration through systematic benchmarking and intelligent agent-based code generation with iterative refinement.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

TL;DR: LTX-2 is an open-source foundational model that generates synchronized audiovisual content using an asymmetric dual-stream transformer architecture with 14B video and 5B audio parameters, achieving state-of-the-art quality comparable to proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models generate silent videos, missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides, limiting the immersive experience of generated content.

Method: Asymmetric dual-stream transformer with 14B-parameter video stream and 5B-parameter audio stream, bidirectional audio-video cross-attention with temporal positional embeddings, cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning, multilingual text encoder, and modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, comparable to proprietary models at fraction of computational cost and inference time, producing rich coherent audio tracks with natural background and foley elements.

Conclusion: LTX-2 demonstrates that unified audiovisual generation with asymmetric architecture allocation is feasible and efficient, enabling high-quality synchronized content generation while being open-source and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC models are limited to individual components and cannot handle end-to-end complex multimedia content creation with multimodal integration (video, audio, text) that editing experts perform in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes MultiMedia-Agent with data generation pipeline, content creation tool library, and preference evaluation metrics. Uses skill acquisition theory for data curation and agent training, two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization (self-correlation and model preference correlation), and three-stage training approach (base/success plan finetune and preference optimization).

Result: Comparison results demonstrate the approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Conclusion: Agent-based systems can effectively automate complex multimedia content creation by integrating multiple modalities and tools, overcoming limitations of current individual AIGC models.

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

TL;DR: InfiniDepth introduces neural implicit fields for continuous depth estimation, enabling arbitrary-resolution outputs with fine geometric detail recovery, outperforming existing discrete grid-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods are limited to discrete image grids, restricting scalability to arbitrary resolutions and hindering geometric detail recovery. Current representations cannot handle continuous coordinate queries needed for fine-grained depth estimation.

Method: InfiniDepth represents depth as neural implicit fields using a simple yet effective local implicit decoder. This allows querying depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.

Conclusion: Neural implicit field representation for depth estimation overcomes limitations of discrete grid-based methods, enabling continuous coordinate queries, arbitrary resolution outputs, and superior geometric detail recovery, with applications extending to novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.

TL;DR: Muses is a training-free method for generating realistic 3D creatures using skeletal guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results without optimization or manual assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for 3D creature generation suffer from unrealistic or incoherent results due to challenges with part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation capabilities. Existing approaches rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, which fail to produce coherent 3D assets.

Method: Muses uses a 3D skeleton as a fundamental representation to guide generation through a structure-aware pipeline: 1) Graph-constrained reasoning to create a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale, 2) Voxel-based assembly in structured latent space guided by the skeleton to integrate regions from different objects, and 3) Image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions to generate style-consistent textures.

Result: Extensive experiments show Muses achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, demonstrating strong potential for flexible 3D object editing.

Conclusion: Muses presents the first training-free, feed-forward method for fantastic 3D creature generation that leverages skeletal representation to overcome limitations of previous approaches, enabling coherent and realistic 3D asset creation with flexible editing capabilities.

Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs into robotics introduces critical security vulnerabilities due to the "embodiment gap" - the discord between LLMs' abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While text-based LLM security is studied, existing solutions are insufficient for embodied agents where malicious outputs manifest as dangerous physical actions rather than just harmful text.

Method: Conducted a systematic survey summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Developed a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors (jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, multi-modal prompt injection) and analyzed/categorized defense mechanisms (formal safety specifications, runtime enforcement, multi-LLM oversight, prompt hardening). Also reviewed key datasets and benchmarks for evaluating embodied system robustness.

Result: The survey provides a foundational roadmap for developing safe, secure, and reliable LLM-controlled robotics. It synthesizes current research to highlight the urgent need for context-aware security solutions that address the unique threats posed by the embodiment gap in robotic systems.

Conclusion: This work systematically maps the security landscape of LLM-controlled robotics, emphasizing that traditional text-based LLM security approaches are inadequate for embodied agents. The survey calls for context-aware security solutions and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding both threats and defenses in this emerging field.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has revolutionized their ability to interpret complex human commands and execute sophisticated tasks. However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems. By synthesizing current research, this work highlights the urgent need for context-aware security solutions and provides a foundational roadmap for the development of safe, secure, and reliable LLM-controlled robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As embodied AI agents move from physical interaction to social intelligence, traditional physical world models fail to capture social interactions. Mental World Models are crucial for natural human-machine collaboration, but current research suffers from fragmented frameworks, disjointed reasoning mechanisms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.

Method: Systematic review synthesizing over 100 authoritative studies to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for MWM, distinguishing MWM from PWMs, defining key components through mental element representation paradigms, analyzing ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 methods, and synthesizing 26 evaluation benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides: 1) First complete theoretical framework for MWM distinguishing essential differences from PWMs, 2) Systematic definition of MWM components through two mental element representation paradigms, 3) Comprehensive analysis of two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 methods, and 4) Clarification of neuro-symbolic hybrid architecture trends with 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: This comprehensive review advances MWM research by providing structured frameworks and analysis tools to promote embodied agents' integration into human society and advance human-machine collaborative interaction through better social intelligence modeling.

Abstract: As the application of Embodied AI Agents in avatars, wearable devices, and robotic systems continues to deepen, their core research challenges have gradually shifted from physical environment interaction to the accurate understanding of social interactions. Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.
  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks. This work aims to promote the integration of embodied agents into human society and advance the in-depth development of human-machine collaborative interaction.

Abstract: Biological systems exhibit a continuous stream of movements, consisting of sequential segments, that allow them to perform complex tasks in a creative and versatile fashion. This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics.

TL;DR: InternVLA-A1 combines semantic understanding with dynamic prediction using a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture with three experts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack physical world dynamics understanding, while world models based on video prediction lack semantic grounding and are brittle with prediction errors. There's a need to synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities.

Method: Proposes InternVLA-A1 with unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture coordinating three experts: scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. Built on InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL at 2B/3B scales, pre-trained on hybrid synthetic-real datasets (533M+ frames) using InternData-A1 and Agibot-World.

Result: Significantly outperforms leading models (pi0 and GR00T N1.5) across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmarks: 14.5% improvement in daily tasks and 40%-73.3% boost in dynamic settings like conveyor belt sorting.

Conclusion: The hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses synthetic simulation diversity while minimizing sim-to-real gap, creating a model that synergizes semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities for superior robotic performance.

Abstract: Prevalent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and demonstrate exceptional proficiency in semantic understanding, but they inherently lack the capability to deduce physical world dynamics. Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\%-73.3\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STEAM formalizes multi-robot task allocation with trait-efficacy maps and spatio-temporal constraints. E-ITAGS algorithm optimizes task performance while respecting time budgets and learns trait-efficacy maps via active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex multi-robot missions require joint optimization of task allocation, scheduling, and path planning under strict constraints, going beyond typical binary success-failure models to consider performance efficacy.

Method: Proposes STEAM framework with trait-efficacy maps and E-ITAGS algorithm that interleaves task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Includes realizability-aware active learning to learn trait-efficacy maps efficiently.

Result: E-ITAGS generates higher-efficacy allocations than baselines while respecting constraints. Active learning is sample efficient with principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency. Experimentally validated suboptimality bounds.

Conclusion: STEAM and E-ITAGS provide a comprehensive solution for heterogeneous multi-robot systems that optimizes task performance under spatio-temporal constraints while efficiently learning performance models.

Abstract: Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.

### [71] [Making Infeasible Tasks Feasible: Planning to Reconfigure Disconnected 3D Environments with Movable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02645)
*Samarth Kalluraya,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BRiDGE is a 3D planning system that enables robots to rearrange movable objects to create bridges between disconnected surfaces, solving navigation problems in environments where goal regions are otherwise unreachable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path planners assume goal regions are reachable, but this fails in disconnected 3D environments where surfaces are separated by height differences, holes, or lateral gaps. Robots need to interact with movable objects to create connections rather than declaring tasks infeasible.

Method: Developed BRiDGE, a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order. Uses non-uniform sampling strategies to accelerate planning and accounts for limited number of movable objects.

Result: The method is probabilistically complete and has been validated through extensive numerical and hardware experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in solving 3D navigation problems by reconfiguring movable objects as bridges.

Conclusion: BRiDGE successfully addresses the challenge of 3D Navigation Among Movable Objects by enabling robots to strategically place movable objects to bridge physical disconnections, extending navigation capabilities beyond traditional reachability assumptions.

Abstract: Several planners have been developed to compute dynamically feasible, collision-free robot paths from an initial to a goal configuration. A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Online 3D bin packing with robotic arms using MPC-MCTS framework with lookahead information to handle distribution shifts, achieving 10%+ gains under shifts and 4% average improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL methods for online 3D bin packing fail to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts when different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. Lookahead information available in logistics systems can help mitigate this issue.

Method: Formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem, adapt Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework with dynamic exploration prior that balances learned RL policy and robust random policy based on lookahead characteristics. Design auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste.

Result: Method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: over 10% gains under distributional shifts, 4% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8% in best cases.

Conclusion: The MPC-MCTS framework with lookahead information effectively handles distribution shifts in online 3D bin packing, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods in real-world logistics scenarios.

Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing (3D-BP) with robotic arms is crucial for reducing transportation and labor costs in modern logistics. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 10\% gains under distributional shifts, 4\% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8\% in the best case--demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DCBF learns composable safety functions that enable robots to safely navigate dense clutter with unavoidable contact, scaling linearly and transferring across tasks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to operate in everyday environments with dense clutter where contact is unavoidable, but traditional safety frameworks treat all contact as unsafe and either avoid collisions (limiting functionality) or become computationally intractable as object count grows.

Method: Dense Contact Barrier Functions (DCBF) learn a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures safety constraints from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with few objects, it composes across arbitrary object sets at runtime to produce a single global safety filter.

Result: DCBF enables collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in dense clutter settings, scaling linearly with object count and transferring across tasks without retraining.

Conclusion: DCBF provides a computationally efficient, transferable safety framework that allows robots to safely operate in dense everyday environments where contact is unavoidable, overcoming limitations of traditional safety approaches.

Abstract: Robots operating in everyday environments must navigate and manipulate within densely cluttered spaces, where physical contact with surrounding objects is unavoidable. Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.

*Kento Kawaharazuka,Keita Yoneda,Takahiro Hattori,Shintaro Inoue,Kei Okada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers performed multi-objective optimization of manipulator structures (joint configurations and link length ratios) to find optimal designs balancing end-effector reachability and joint torque, analyzing how existing manipulators compare to optimization results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulator designs have historically been determined empirically, and recent robotic foundation models use various different manipulator structures with different joint orders and link length ratios. There's a need to systematically determine optimal manipulator structures rather than relying on empirical approaches.

Method: Performed multi-objective optimization considering two key performance metrics: end-effector reachability and joint torque. Analyzed sampling results from the optimization to evaluate where existing manipulator structures fall within the design space.

Result: The optimization provides a systematic framework for evaluating manipulator structures. Analysis shows where existing manipulator designs (6-DOF and 7-DOF) stand relative to the Pareto-optimal solutions identified through optimization.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for future manipulator design by establishing a systematic optimization approach rather than empirical design methods, helping designers understand trade-offs between reachability and torque requirements.

Abstract: Various 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) and 7-DOF manipulators have been developed to date. Over a long history, their joint configurations and link length ratios have been determined empirically. In recent years, the development of robotic foundation models has become increasingly active, leading to the continuous proposal of various manipulators to support these models. However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots. Therefore, in order to discuss the optimal structure of a manipulator, we performed multi-objective optimization from the perspectives of end-effector reachability and joint torque. We analyze where existing manipulator structures stand within the sampling results of the optimization and provide insights for future manipulator design.

TL;DR: Integrating AnyLoc's deep features and adaptive thresholds improves loop closure accuracy in DPV-SLAM over traditional BoVW methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loop closure is critical for SLAM accuracy, but classical BoVW methods using handcrafted features struggle with viewpoint and lighting variations, requiring manual threshold tuning.

Method: Replace BoVW with AnyLoc's learning-based visual place recognition using deep features, plus an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds based on environmental conditions.

Result: Significantly outperforms original DPV-SLAM in loop closure accuracy and robustness on indoor/outdoor datasets, offering practical scalability.

Conclusion: The integration of deep feature representations and adaptive thresholding provides a practical, scalable solution for enhancing loop closure performance in modern SLAM systems.

Abstract: Loop closure is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of visual SLAM. We propose a method to improve loop closure performance in DPV-SLAM. Our approach integrates AnyLoc, a learning-based visual place recognition technique, as a replacement for the classical Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) loop detection method. In contrast to BoVW, which relies on handcrafted features, AnyLoc utilizes deep feature representations, enabling more robust image retrieval across diverse viewpoints and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity threshold based on environmental conditions, removing the need for manual tuning. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the original DPV-SLAM in terms of loop closure accuracy and robustness. The proposed method offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing loop closure performance in modern SLAM systems.

*Kexin Guo,Zihan Yang,Yuhang Liu,Jindou Jia,Xiang Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework for aggressive robotic motion control using hybrid dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world physics can't be perfectly modeled analytically, leading to tracking errors for aggressive trajectories due to residual physics that aren't captured by nominal models.

Method: 1) Learn unknown dynamic effects as residuals of nominal dynamics using self-supervised learning with analytic gradients from trajectory-level data; 2) Develop trajectory optimizer that minimizes residual physics along computed trajectories.

Result: Framework enables accurate long-horizon prediction with arbitrary integration steps and outputs aggressive trajectories that can be precisely tracked, demonstrated with quadrotor agile flight.

Conclusion: The hybrid dynamics approach combining learned residuals with nominal models enables precise tracking of aggressive motions that would be challenging with analytical models alone.

Abstract: Real-world physics can only be analytically modeled with a certain level of precision for modern intricate robotic systems. As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.

TL;DR: Meta-learning framework with feedback-calibrated online adaptation for estimating non-structural disturbances in robotics, achieving simultaneous convergence of learning and estimation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learning approaches for disturbance estimation require shared representations of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Representation errors and distribution shifts degrade prediction accuracy in real-world applications.

Method: Combines meta-learning with feedback-calibrated online adaptation. Extracts features from finite time window of past observations to learn unified representation capturing non-structural disturbances without predefined structural assumptions. Uses state-feedback mechanism to calibrate online adaptation and attenuate learning residuals.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows simultaneous convergence of online learning error and disturbance estimation error. Framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, demonstrated through quadrotor flight experiments.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides generalizable disturbance estimation for robotic applications with non-structural disturbances, overcoming limitations of existing meta-learning approaches through unified meta-representation and feedback-calibrated adaptation.

Abstract: Precise control in modern robotic applications is always an open issue due to unknown time-varying disturbances. Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

Abstract: Assistive electric-powered wheelchairs (EPWs) have become essential mobility aids for people with disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), post-stroke hemiplegia, and dementia-related mobility impairment. This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.
  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.

Motivation: Traditional frame-based cameras fail in agile locomotion due to motion blur, especially in low-light conditions. Event cameras offer advantages but existing datasets lack stereo configurations and multi-band sensing under varied illumination.

Method: Created M-SEVIQ dataset using Unitree Go2 quadruped robot equipped with stereo event cameras, frame-based camera, IMU, and joint encoders. Collected 30+ real-world sequences across different velocities, illumination wavelengths, and lighting conditions with comprehensive calibration data.

Conclusion: M-SEVIQ addresses limitations in existing event camera datasets and supports research in agile robot perception, sensor fusion, semantic segmentation, and multi-modal vision in challenging environments.

Abstract: Agile locomotion in legged robots poses significant challenges for visual perception. Traditional frame-based cameras often fail in these scenarios for producing blurred images, particularly under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras capture changes in brightness asynchronously, offering low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. These advantages make them suitable for robust perception during rapid motion and under challenging illumination. However, existing event camera datasets exhibit limitations in stereo configurations and multi-band sensing domains under various illumination conditions. To address this gap, we present M-SEVIQ, a multi-band stereo event visual and inertial quadruped dataset collected using a Unitree Go2 equipped with stereo event cameras, a frame-based camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders. This dataset contains more than 30 real-world sequences captured across different velocity levels, illumination wavelengths, and lighting conditions. In addition, comprehensive calibration data, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and temporal alignments, are provided to facilitate accurate sensor fusion and benchmarking. Our M-SEVIQ can be used to support research in agile robot perception, sensor fusion, semantic segmentation and multi-modal vision in challenging environments.

TL;DR: Sim-to-real RL framework for dexterous hand manipulation using tactile feedback and torque sensing, enabling zero-shot transfer of controllable grasping and object reorientation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training control policies for multi-finger dexterous hands is challenging due to contact-rich physics and imperfect actuation, requiring practical sim-to-real solutions.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) fast tactile simulation using parallel forward kinematics for dense touch signals, (2) current-to-torque calibration eliminating need for torque sensors, (3) actuator dynamics modeling with randomization of non-ideal effects. Uses asymmetric actor-critic PPO trained entirely in simulation.

Result: Policies deploy directly to five-finger hand without fine-tuning, demonstrating controllable grasp force tracking and object reorientation robustly executed on real hardware.

Conclusion: Combining tactile and torque observations with effective sensing/actuation modeling provides practical solution for reliable dexterous manipulation, achieving first zero-shot transfer of controllable grasping on multi-finger hand.

Abstract: Human-like dexterous hands with multiple fingers offer human-level manipulation capabilities, but training control policies that can directly deploy on real hardware remains difficult due to contact-rich physics and imperfect actuation. We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of controllable grasping on a multi-finger dexterous hand trained entirely in simulation and transferred zero-shot on real hardware.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation is crucial for both medical and industrial endoscopic robots, enabling safe and efficient exploration of narrow tubular environments without continuous human intervention, where avoiding contact with the inner walls has been a longstanding challenge for prior approaches. We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking. Compared with the original Depth Anything model, our method improves $δ_{1}$ depth accuracy by 39.2% and reduces the navigation J-index by 0.67 relative to the second-best method, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots are limited in deployment due to vulnerability to falls and safety risks posed by their rigid structures to people and environments. Current designs lack effective protection mechanisms for impact scenarios.

Method: Developed a soft-rigid co-design framework using non-Newtonian fluid-based responsive materials that remain compliant during normal interactions but rapidly stiffen under impact. Used physics-based simulations to guide protector placement/thickness and learn active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid.

Result: Protector significantly reduces peak impact forces, enables repeated falls without hardware damage (including drops from 3m and tumbles down staircases). Improves robot robustness and environmental safety across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of responsive materials, structural co-design, and learning-based control advances the development of interact-safe, industry-ready humanoid robots that can operate safely in human-centered environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned as general-purpose platforms in human-centered environments, yet their deployment is limited by vulnerability to falls and the risks posed by rigid metal-plastic structures to people and surroundings. We introduce a soft-rigid co-design framework that leverages non-Newtonian fluid-based soft responsive materials to enhance humanoid safety. The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases. Across diverse scenarios, the approach improves robot robustness and environmental safety. By uniting responsive materials, structural co-design, and learning-based control, this work advances interact-safe, industry-ready humanoid robots.

TL;DR: Combining diffusion models with MPC for real-time collision-aware motion planning in cluttered environments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional optimization-based controllers struggle with feasibility in cluttered scenes, while diffusion models lack efficient scene conditioning for control

Method: Hybrid approach: diffusion transformer with object-centric slot attention for warm-starting, followed by collision-aware MPC for refinement

Result: Higher success rates and lower latency than baselines; real-robot experiments confirm reliable execution

Conclusion: Combining diffusion-based warm-starting with MPC yields efficient, reliable motion generation in cluttered environments

Abstract: Acting in cluttered environments requires predicting and avoiding collisions while still achieving precise control. Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone. Real-robot experiments with a torque-controlled Panda confirm reliable and safe execution with MPC.

Result: Higher success rates, lower tracking error, and more accurate parameter estimates compared to baselines in both simulation and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: PRMPPI provides a framework for safe robot control that starts cautiously, improves performance as parameters are learned, and maintains safety throughout operation in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Robots deployed in dynamic environments must remain safe even when key physical parameters are uncertain or change over time. We propose Parameter-Robust Model Predictive Path Integral (PRMPPI) control, a framework that integrates online parameter learning with probabilistic safety constraints. PRMPPI maintains a particle-based belief over parameters via Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evaluates safety constraints using Conformal Prediction, and optimizes both a nominal performance-driven and a safety-focused backup trajectory in parallel. This yields a controller that is cautious at first, improves performance as parameters are learned, and ensures safety throughout. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate higher success rates, lower tracking error, and more accurate parameter estimates than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based robotic policies struggle with viewpoint changes, especially in real-world settings where viewpoint variability is unavoidable.

Method: Proposes View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA) which models latent actions capturing transition patterns across trajectories. Uses action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences to align latent actions across viewpoints, learning view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real world show VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks. VILA establishes itself as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.

Conclusion: VILA successfully addresses viewpoint invariance in robotic policies by grounding representations in physical dynamics through latent action modeling, providing a robust pretraining framework that enhances generalization to unseen viewpoints and new tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based robotic policies often struggle with even minor viewpoint changes, underscoring the need for view-invariant visual representations. This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.

TL;DR: Bi-directional cooperative landing framework transforms quadcopter recovery from single-agent tracking to coupled system optimization, where mobile platform actively tilts to create optimal landing conditions while quadcopter plans time-optimal trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional "track-then-descend" methods are inefficient for dynamic scenarios, treating the platform as passive and forcing complex sequential maneuvers. Need for more agile, efficient autonomous landing on mobile platforms.

Method: Introduces bi-directional cooperative framework where mobile platform actively tilts its surface to create optimal terminal attitude for quadcopter, while quadcopter generates time-optimal, dynamically feasible trajectories. Parallelizes alignment and descent phases.

Result: Framework significantly improves efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex, time-constrained missions, validated in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: Transforming landing from single-agent tracking to coupled system optimization with active platform cooperation enables agile recovery with aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization.

Abstract: Autonomous landing on mobile platforms is crucial for extending quadcopter operational flexibility, yet conventional methods are often too inefficient for highly dynamic scenarios. The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.

Motivation: Generalist robots capable of natural language interpretation need validation methods that go beyond traditional approaches, as each task creates unique operational contexts and correctness specifications.

Method: Two-layer framework: abstract layer uses situation calculus to model world and derive weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing; concrete layer instantiates configurations for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring.

Result: Framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller for tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.

Conclusion: The proposed validation framework successfully addresses the challenge of validating generalist robots by combining abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification, showing practical effectiveness in finding failures.

Abstract: Generalist robots are becoming a reality, capable of interpreting natural language instructions and executing diverse operations. However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods. We propose a two-layer validation framework that combines abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification. At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.

### [89] [PiDR: Physics-Informed Inertial Dead Reckoning for Autonomous Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03040)
*Arup Kumar Sahoo,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PiDR is a physics-informed deep learning framework for pure inertial navigation that integrates inertial navigation principles into network training to reduce drift and improve accuracy with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure inertial navigation systems suffer from drift due to sensor noise and errors, especially in GNSS/vision-denied environments. Conventional deep learning approaches are black-box, struggle with limited data, and don't preserve physical principles.

Method: PiDR integrates inertial navigation principles into network training through a physics-informed residual component, creating a transparent framework that mitigates trajectory deviations even with sparse supervision.

Result: Achieved over 29% positioning improvement on real-world datasets from mobile robot and autonomous underwater vehicle, demonstrating generalization across different platforms and environments.

Conclusion: PiDR provides a robust, lightweight architecture suitable for resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios while maintaining physical interpretability.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy is the ability to sustain accurate navigation in the absence of external data, such as GNSS signals or visual information. In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.

TL;DR: SOP enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world using a fleet of robots for scalable on-policy adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA post-training approaches are limited to offline, single-robot, or task-specific methods, which restricts effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction.

Method: SOP uses a closed-loop architecture where a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, which asynchronously sends back updated policies. The system is algorithm-agnostic, demonstrated with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP).

Result: SOP substantially improves performance of large pretrained VLA models across real-world manipulation tasks (cloth folding, box assembly, grocery restocking) while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours, with performance scaling near-linearly with fleet size.

Conclusion: Tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment enables efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization through large-scale pre-training, but real-world deployment requires expert-level task proficiency in addition to broad generality. Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.

TL;DR: Proposed time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme with convex relaxation for solving optimal control problems with spatial-temporal constraints efficiently and optimally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal control problems for autonomous agents under spatial and temporal constraints are challenging due to nonconvex coupling between dynamics and event timing. Existing approaches using predefined waypoint times or nonconvex optimization yield suboptimal solutions.

Method: Time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints, plus fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation exploiting sparsity pattern of lifted formulation.

Result: Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate solution optimality and computational efficiency. Real-world experiments on quadrotor waypoint flight with constrained open time windows validate practical applicability in complex environments.

Conclusion: The proposed formulation significantly improves numerical properties for solving optimal control problems with spatial-temporal constraints, enabling efficient and optimal solutions for autonomous agents in applications like eco-driving and quadrotor navigation.

Abstract: Solving optimal control problems (OCPs) of autonomous agents operating under spatial and temporal constraints fast and accurately is essential in applications ranging from eco-driving of autonomous vehicles to quadrotor navigation. However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a quadrotor waypoint flight task with constrained open time windows validate the practical applicability of the approach in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robotic systems become more complex, there's a critical need for explainable decision-making. Current approaches either focus on individual modules (hard to query for high-level behavior) or use monolithic approaches (don't exploit robotic architecture modularity).

Method: HEXAR uses specialized component explainers with diverse techniques (LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for each query.

Result: HEXAR significantly outperforms end-to-end and aggregated baselines across 180 scenario-query variations in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks.

Conclusion: HEXAR offers a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems by providing a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems.

Abstract: As robotic systems become increasingly complex, the need for explainable decision-making becomes critical. Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.

TL;DR: Learning-based geometric controller using dual quaternions and Gaussian Processes for robust SE(3) trajectory tracking with formal stability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust trajectory tracking controllers that can handle unknown disturbances and modeling imperfections in autonomous robotic systems (aerial vehicles, omnidirectional robots) without relying on explicit parametric models.

Method: Geometric feedback controller formulated in dual quaternion framework operating at velocity level, integrated with Gaussian Process regression to learn and compensate online for unknown state-dependent disturbances while preserving rigid-body motion structure.

Result: Lyapunov analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty. Simulations show accurate, smooth trajectory tracking despite realistic localized disturbances including correlated rotational/translational effects.

Conclusion: Combining geometric modeling with probabilistic learning enables robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems with formal stability guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.
  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.
  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.

Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

*Jiaqi Liu,Yaofeng Su,Peng Xia,Siwei Han,Zeyu Zheng,Cihang Xie,Mingyu Ding,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimpleMem is an efficient memory framework for LLM agents that uses semantic lossless compression to manage historical experiences, achieving better performance with significantly reduced token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLM agents either retain full interaction histories (causing redundancy) or use iterative reasoning (incurring high token costs), creating a need for more efficient memory management.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Semantic Structured Compression distills interactions into compact memory units, 2) Recursive Memory Consolidation integrates units into higher-level abstract representations, 3) Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving 26.4% average F1 improvement while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30x.

Conclusion: SimpleMem demonstrates superior balance between performance and efficiency for LLM agent memory systems through semantic lossless compression, enabling reliable long-term interaction in complex environments.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

### [98] [Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577)
*Alexander Roman,Jacob Roman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orchestral is a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers, eliminating vendor lock-in and API fragmentation while maintaining simplicity for scientific computing and production use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face a choice between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers is challenging due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems.

Method: Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that works across providers, eliminating manual format translation. It uses automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints for type safety, employs a synchronous execution model with streaming support for deterministic behavior, and features a modular architecture that separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user interfaces.

Result: The framework provides a unified interface that eliminates framework-induced complexity while supporting advanced agent capabilities including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

Conclusion: Orchestral addresses the core engineering challenges of building portable, reliable LLM agent systems by providing a lightweight, type-safe framework that bridges provider fragmentation while maintaining the simplicity needed for both scientific computing and production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

*Jeiyoon Park,Daehwan Lee,Changmin Yeo,Yongshin Han,Minseop Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates practical deployment aspects of on-device AI models, focusing on model selection, resource consumption, and domain adaptation capabilities for live-stream chat translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite efficiency gains, there's little research on practical real-world deployment aspects like CPU utilization and thermal conditions for on-device AI models, which are crucial for serving heterogeneous user bases in constrained mobile environments.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments on five mobile devices, focusing on two key issues: (1) on-device model selection and resource consumption analysis, and (2) domain adaptation capabilities. They create LiveChatBench, a manually constructed benchmark of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs for live-stream chat translation.

Result: Experiments show that while serving diverse users requires careful consideration of constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-5.1 on the targeted live-stream chat translation task.

Conclusion: The findings provide meaningful insights for the on-device AI community, demonstrating that with proper model selection and consideration of deployment constraints, on-device models can achieve competitive performance for specific domain tasks like live-stream chat translation.

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

### [100] [AWARE-US: Benchmark for Preference-Aware Resolution in Tool-Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02643)
*Mehmet Kurmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based methods for preference-aware query repair when database queries are infeasible, with a new benchmark for evaluating persona-grounded constraint relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational agents either return "no results" or use ad-hoc constraint relaxation that may violate user intent when queries are infeasible. There's a need for systematic methods that relax the least important constraints based on user preferences.

Method: Three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Also introduces AWARE-US benchmark for persona-grounded queries requiring disambiguation and preference-aware infeasibility resolution.

Result: Local weighting achieves best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. The AWARE-US benchmark enables evaluation of agents' ability to handle underspecification and infeasibility while respecting persona-implied preferences.

Conclusion: Preference-aware query repair is crucial for conversational agents handling infeasible database queries. LLM-based methods can effectively infer constraint importance from dialogue, with different approaches excelling at different aspects of the problem.

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

TL;DR: GTL-CIRL: A closed-loop RL framework that learns policies while mining causal graph temporal logic specifications, using robustness-based rewards and Bayesian optimization for efficient learning in spatial-temporal networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard black-box RL overlooks how local changes propagate through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability in spatial-temporal decision-making tasks on graphs.

Method: Simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic specifications; shapes rewards with robustness measures; collects counterexamples when effects fail; uses Gaussian Process-driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates.

Result: Case studies in gene and power networks demonstrate faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

Conclusion: GTL-CIRL provides an interpretable, efficient framework for spatial-temporal decision-making that captures causal relationships and network propagation effects.

Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

*Dongyu Chen,Jian Ma,Xianpeng Zhang,Lei Zhang,Haonan Lu,Chen Chen,Chuangchuang Wang,Kai Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAPO framework addresses prompt drift and interpretability issues in prompt optimization through hierarchical attribution and semantic-unit editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods suffer from prompt drift (fixing failures but impairing previously successful tasks) and compromised interpretability when generating prompts from scratch.

Method: Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) with: (1) dynamic attribution targeting error patterns, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Result: HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods in contexts like single/multi-image QA (OCRV2) and complex task analysis (BBH).

Conclusion: HAPO establishes an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering that addresses prompt drift while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As conversational agents work with users over time, adapting to user preferences is crucial for building long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality.

Method: Introduces MultiSessionCollab benchmark and develops long-term collaborative agents with persistent memory that refines user preferences as interactions accumulate. Uses learning signals from user simulator behavior to train agents for better reflection and memory updates.

Result: Memory-equipped agents achieve higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Human study confirms memory improves real-world user experience.

Conclusion: Memory-based adaptation to user preferences significantly enhances long-term collaboration quality for conversational agents, as validated through both simulated benchmarks and human studies.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

*Zhi Liu,Guangzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for "Time-Scaling" - systematically extending AI agents' ability to unfold reasoning over time to achieve deeper problem-solving without proportional parameter increases, addressing limitations in current LLM reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI paradigms are converging into cognitive agents, but LLMs lack robust semantic reasoning despite prompting techniques like CoT and ToT. These methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency, creating a need for systematic temporal reasoning extension.

Method: Proposes "Time-Scaling" - architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways for deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints.

Result: Time-Scaling represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters, enabling more human-like cognitive capabilities.

Conclusion: Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational for next-generation AI systems.

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAL framework aligns LLMs to conversational human-likeness using interpretable, data-driven rewards derived from explicit conversational traits, improving human perception without affecting overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational human-likeness is crucial for human-AI interaction but difficult to define, measure, and optimize. Current improvements rely on scale or broad supervised training rather than targeted alignment.

Method: HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods.

Result: Models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation in large-scale human evaluations, without affecting their overall performance. The framework enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects.

Conclusion: HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable, explainable way, expanding the scope of what can be aligned in language models beyond traditional metrics.

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with reliable permeability prediction due to its wide range and high variability in oil/gas reservoirs. Quantum computing principles could enhance spatial prediction capabilities.

Method: Developed QLSTMA model incorporating variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into LSTM recurrent cells, using quantum entanglement and superposition. Tested two structures: QLSTMA-SG (Shared Gates) and QLSTMA-IG (Independent Gates) with different qubit configurations.

Result: 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperformed traditional LSTMA, reducing MAE by 19% and RMSE by 20%, especially in regions with complex well-logging data. More qubits yielded better accuracy.

Conclusion: Quantum-classical hybrid neural networks show strong potential for reservoir prediction, establishing a framework for future deployment on real quantum hardware and broader applications in petroleum engineering.

Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL algorithms require large training datasets and struggle with generalization beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks.

Method: Partial policies from simple domain instances are represented as logical rules and transferred as priors. Online reasoning guides training through: (i) biasing action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation.

Result: Improved performance over state-of-the-art reward machine baseline on challenging gridworld variants in both fully observable and partially observable settings, with enhanced interpretability and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration of background symbolic knowledge accelerates convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons, while improving sample efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

Evaluates nine base models with different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities, incorporating efficiency metrics like token consumption and inference time.

Result: Extensive experiments provide systematic insights into MAD effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency across text-only and multimodal scenarios, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison and performance-cost trade-off analysis.

Conclusion: M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for standardized MAD evaluation, addressing current limitations and supporting future research with comprehensive multi-domain, multi-modal, multi-dimensional assessment capabilities.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

TL;DR: SimRPD: A three-stage framework using user simulation and Chain-of-Intention evaluation to generate high-quality training data for recruitment proactive dialogue agents, overcoming data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents are crucial for recruitment (e.g., acquiring social-media contacts), but their performance is limited by scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific training data. Supervised fine-tuning and RL need better data.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Develop high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. 2) Introduce multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) with global-level and instance-level metrics to assess simulator and select high-quality data. 3) Train recruitment proactive dialogue agent on selected dataset.

Result: Experiments in real-world recruitment scenario show SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, demonstrating practical value for industrial deployment and potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: SimRPD effectively addresses data scarcity for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents through simulated data generation and intelligent quality selection, offering a practical solution with broader business applications.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

### [113] [ReTreVal: Reasoning Tree with Validation -- A Hybrid Framework for Enhanced LLM Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02880)
*Abhishek HS,Pavan C Shekar,Arpit Jain,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTreVal is a hybrid reasoning framework combining Tree-of-Thoughts exploration with self-critique, validation, and memory to improve multi-step reasoning in LLMs for math and creative writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods (ReAct, Reflexion, Self-Refine) lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-step reasoning domains like mathematics and creative writing.

Method: ReTreVal integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration with self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory. It constructs adaptive-depth reasoning trees where nodes undergo iterative self-critique and refinement, uses dual validation for quality assessment, implements critique-based pruning to retain top-k nodes, and maintains a reflexion memory buffer for cross-problem learning.

Result: ReTreVal consistently outperforms ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B, demonstrating superior performance through structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory.

Conclusion: ReTreVal's combination of structured tree exploration, iterative self-critique, validation mechanisms, and persistent memory makes it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer, addressing key limitations in current LLM reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

### [114] [Logical Phase Transitions: Understanding Collapse in LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02902)
*Xinglang Zhang,Yunyao Zhang,ZeLiang Chen,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang,Zikai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show sudden performance collapse at critical logical complexity thresholds (Logical Phase Transitions), not gradual decline. Proposed Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning adaptively aligns language with logic symbols and trains around phase boundaries to improve reasoning at high complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic logical reasoning is crucial for reliable decision-making in high-stakes domains like math and law, but current LLMs struggle with increasing logical complexity. The paper aims to understand and address the sudden collapse of reasoning performance beyond certain complexity thresholds.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis reveals Logical Phase Transitions phenomenon; 2) Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to create shared representations; 3) Reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show the approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, achieving average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in Chain-of-Thought prompting, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

Conclusion: Logical reasoning in LLMs exhibits phase-transition behavior rather than smooth degradation, and the proposed Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning successfully addresses this by aligning language with logic and progressive training around complexity boundaries, enabling more reliable high-complexity reasoning.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

*Xuan Yang,Furong Jia,Roy Xie,Xiong Xi,Hengwei Bian,Jian Li,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Batch-of-Thought (BoT) enables LLMs to process related queries jointly instead of independently, improving reasoning through cross-instance learning, consistency checks, and computational amortization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals like shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints, leading to inefficient use of computational resources and missed opportunities for mutual learning.

Method: BoT processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. It performs comparative analysis across batches to identify high-quality reasoning templates, detect errors through consistency checks, and amortize computational costs. BoT-R instantiates this within a multi-agent reflection architecture where a Reflector performs joint evaluation.

Result: Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks show BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%.

Conclusion: Batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems by unlocking mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing, with theoretical and experimental analysis revealing when and why this approach is effective.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RationaleTS introduces rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, using label-conditioned rationales as guiding reasoning units instead of post-hoc explanations, with hybrid retrieval balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs underperform in time series reasoning due to lack of rationale priors connecting temporal observations to outcomes, causing models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning.

Method: Proposes RationaleTS with two key components: 1) Inducing label-conditioned rationales as reasoning paths from observable evidence to potential outcomes, and 2) Designing hybrid retrieval balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for in-context inference.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. Code will be released for reproduction.

Conclusion: RationaleTS addresses the rationale prior gap in time series reasoning by grounding in-context learning in explicit reasoning paths, moving beyond superficial pattern matching to principled reasoning.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

*Qusai Khaled,Pasquale De Marinis,Moez Louati,David Ferras,Laura Genga,Uzay Kaymak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Explainable GNN framework using mutual information and fuzzy logic for water leak detection, balancing performance with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for explainable leak detection in water networks since current GNNs are black-box models, limiting practical adoption despite their spatial-temporal capabilities.

Method: Proposed fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) integrating mutual information to identify critical regions and fuzzy logic for rule-based explanations, based on GENConv architecture.

Result: FGENConv achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 (detection) and 0.814 (localization), slightly below crisp GENConv (0.938 and 0.858) but provides interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: Fuzzy GNN strikes balance between precision and explainability, enabling engineers to validate predictions, conserve resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

*Adam Keane,Nick Pepper,Chris Burr,Amy Hodgkin,Dewi Gould,John Korna,Marc Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an assurance framework for Digital Twins in aviation using Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance methodology to demonstrate regulatory compliance and system accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital Twins combining simulation, operational data, and AI have significant potential in aviation but face a developing regulatory landscape requiring application-specific compliance. There's a need for structured approaches to demonstrate Digital Twin accuracy and functionality for regulatory approval.

Method: Developed an assurance framework using Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) methodology to create structured assurance cases with nested arguments, evidence, assumptions, and justifications. The framework draws on emerging guidance for Digital Twin development and AI/ML in Air Traffic Management.

Result: Created a practical framework that defines actionable goals and evidence requirements for demonstrating Digital Twin accuracy and functionality. The framework helps researchers assess strengths/limitations, identify improvement areas, and provides a foundation for stakeholder/regulator engagement through Project Bluebird's UK airspace Digital Twin example.

Conclusion: The assurance framework provides a structured approach for Digital Twin validation and regulatory compliance, contributing to emerging guidance through a concrete working example and supporting the development of trustworthy AI Air Traffic Control systems in aviation.

Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic column name expansion (CNE) is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding, but has received little existing work. Existing prompt engineering approaches are complex and require tuning.

Method: A simpler automatic prompt engineering system that requires no tuning and no explicit task clues, applied to the CNE task for database tables.

Result: First work to apply automatic prompt engineering for CNE task, and first to apply it to a language other than English (German). System is as effective as existing approaches despite being simpler.

Conclusion: Simpler automatic prompt engineering can be as effective as complex approaches for CNE tasks, and the approach works across multiple languages (English and German).

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

*Chenglin Yu,Yuchen Wang,Songmiao Wang,Hongxia Yang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a framework that uses file-centric state abstraction to keep agent reasoning context bounded for long-horizon tasks, achieving competitive performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and error accumulation, while existing solutions like context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting create trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability.

Method: InfiAgent externalizes persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction, keeping reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions.

Result: Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit state externalization provides a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents, enabling smaller models to perform competitively on complex tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

TL;DR: MAGMA introduces a multi-graph memory architecture that separates semantic, temporal, causal, and entity information into orthogonal graphs, enabling policy-guided retrieval for better long-context reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-augmented generation approaches rely on monolithic memory stores that entangle different types of information (temporal, causal, entity), limiting interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy.

Method: MAGMA represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs, and formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval, addressing limitations of existing memory-augmented generation approaches.

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.
