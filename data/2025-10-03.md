### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andr√©s Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO is a zero-shot video restoration method that uses Video Consistency Models (VCMs) instead of frame-by-frame image diffusion models to achieve temporally consistent reconstructions with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot image restoration methods using latent diffusion models (LDMs) fail when applied to video due to temporal inconsistencies when processing frames individually, creating the need for video-specific priors that capture temporal dependencies.

Method: The proposed LVTINO method leverages Video Consistency Models (VCMs) - distilled video latent diffusion models that explicitly capture temporal causality - as priors for video inverse problems. It uses a conditioning mechanism that bypasses automatic differentiation and requires only a few neural function evaluations.

Result: Extensive experiments show LVTINO achieves significant perceptual improvements over state-of-the-art frame-by-frame LDM methods, establishing new benchmarks in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency for various video inverse problems.

Conclusion: LVTINO demonstrates that using video-specific consistency models as priors enables temporally consistent, high-quality video restoration with computational efficiency, outperforming naive frame-by-frame application of image diffusion models.

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage training method for fine-grained style-controlled image generation that extracts style representations from reference images and aligns them with text conditions without modifying the base generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained styles cannot be precisely described in natural language, and stylized reference images are difficult to align with textual conditions in traditional text-to-image generation models.

Method: Proposes a three-stage training method using a style encoder and style projection layer to extract style representations from reference images and align them with text representations. Uses the Style30k-captions dataset containing image-style label-text description triads.

Result: Enables fine-grained controlled stylized image generation by injecting style representations into the generative model while maintaining its structural framework.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves fine-grained style control in image generation by extracting and aligning style representations with text conditions, maximizing the generative capability of pretrained models without architectural changes.

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoStruggle, a dataset for detecting and localizing struggle during skill acquisition, showing that temporal action localization models can identify struggle across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation datasets don't capture how struggle evolves during skill learning, which is crucial for optimizing human learning and developing assistive systems.

Method: Collected 61.68 hours of video recordings from 76 participants performing 18 tasks across 4 activities (knots, origami, tangram, card shuffling), with each task repeated 5 times to capture skill evolution. Defined struggle determination as temporal action localization.

Result: Temporal Action Localization models achieved 34.56% mAP when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% mAP across activities, showing struggle is a transferable concept across skill-based tasks.

Conclusion: Struggle can be detected as a transferable concept across various tasks, though there's room for improvement in struggle detection models.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS is a compact foundation model using a lightweight residual U-Net architecture for solving diverse PDEs, achieving SOTA generalization with minimal parameters and fine-tuning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parameter-efficient foundation model for PDE solving that avoids the computational overhead of large transformer-based models while maintaining strong generalization capabilities.

Method: Leverages a lightweight residual U-Net architecture with auto-regressive pretraining strategy that mimics numerical solver behavior, pretrained on diverse fluid dynamics PDEs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization on 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: SPUS demonstrates that residual U-Net architectures can serve as highly parameter-efficient foundation models for solving diverse PDE systems effectively.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes identity diversity in multi-human image generation, solving issues like face duplication and identity merging in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with multi-human prompts, duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals, creating an identity crisis in generative models.

Method: DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that penalizes facial similarity, discourages identity repetition, enforces accurate person counts, and preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores.

Result: On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread, surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods like Gemini and GPT-Image while maintaining competitive perceptual quality.

Conclusion: DisCo establishes a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach for worldwide visual geo-localization that combines hierarchical geographic embeddings with fused visual-semantic representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual geo-localization by explicitly modeling geographic hierarchy and effectively combining visual appearance with semantic information, addressing limitations in current learned representations of geography.

Method: Formulates geo-localization as aligning visual query representations with learned geographic embeddings. Uses hierarchical geographic representations and fuses appearance features with semantic segmentation maps to create robust visual representations.

Result: Achieved improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics across five benchmark datasets, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: The combination of geographic and visual representations is the primary driver of performance gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of hierarchical geographic modeling and visual-semantic fusion for geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS is a novel data selection method for Large Vision-Language Models that clusters examples based on cross-modal attention matrix trajectories to eliminate redundancy, achieving significant data reduction while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-efficient learning for LVLMs is underexplored, with existing methods failing to outperform random selection. The need exists to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets while maintaining model performance.

Method: XMAS clusters examples based on trajectories of top singular values of cross-modal attention matrices from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM, then samples balanced subsets from these clusters to remove redundancy.

Result: XMAS discards 50% of LLaVA-665k and 85% of Vision-Flan datasets while fully preserving LLaVA-1.5-7B performance on 10 benchmarks, speeding up training by 1.2x and achieving 30% more data reduction than best baseline.

Conclusion: XMAS provides the first principled method for data-efficient LVLM instruction tuning, effectively removing redundancy in large-scale training data while maintaining model performance and accelerating training.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception is a variational flow matching method for vector-quantized image generation that combines continuous transport dynamics with categorical supervision over codebook indices, achieving faster training convergence and competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k 256x256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous transport methods (which have geometric awareness) and discrete categorical approaches (which provide explicit supervision) in vector-quantized image generation, enabling uncertainty quantification and temperature-controlled generation.

Method: Adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space, combining discrete supervision with continuous transport dynamics.

Result: Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation, demonstrating improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation, combining the benefits of both approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified deep learning framework that simultaneously generates synthetic contrast-enhanced CT images from non-contrast CT scans and segments aortic lumen and thrombus using conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce risks associated with iodinated contrast agents in abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment, including nephrotoxicity, allergies, and environmental harm, by minimizing contrast agent use through synthetic CECT generation.

Method: Integrates conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning for end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation, sharing encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and using semi-supervised training to handle missing segmentation labels in clinical data.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art models with PSNR of 25.61 dB for image synthesis (vs 23.80 dB), lumen Dice score of 0.89 (vs 0.87), thrombus Dice score of 0.53 (vs 0.48), lumen diameter MAE of 4.19 mm (vs 5.78 mm), and thrombus area error of 33.85% (vs 41.45%) on 264-patient cohort.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses limitations of multi-stage pipelines by leveraging shared semantic structures, demonstrating improved performance in both synthetic image quality and anatomical segmentation accuracy for AAA assessment.

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for efficiently prototyping multi-modal video analysis pipelines using pre-trained models to create temporal semi-structured data and queryable knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal content analysis is complex and computationally expensive, requiring significant engineering effort. Existing pre-trained models on static data need better integration methods for complex data like videos.

Method: Develop a framework that combines pre-trained models into pipelines to convert videos into temporal semi-structured data, then translate this into frame-level indexed knowledge graphs that are queryable and support continual learning.

Result: Created a system that enables dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through interactive mediums while maintaining queryable video analysis capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal video analysis by providing an efficient prototyping approach that leverages existing pre-trained models and supports continual learning through knowledge graph representation.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT is a framework that reverse-engineers website functionality into reusable tools, enabling web agents to perform high-level operations like search, filter, and sort instead of fragile step-by-step UI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents are brittle and rely on heavy LLM reasoning that breaks under dynamic layouts and long task horizons, unlike humans who exploit built-in website functionality through high-level operations.

Method: WALT reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools that abstract away low-level execution, spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete) operations.

Result: On VisualWebArena and WebArena benchmarks, WALT achieves higher success rates with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: WALT establishes a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation by shifting computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised segmentation framework that uses topological consistency across multiple perturbed predictions to preserve meaningful structures in histopathology images, with a novel matching strategy for feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed and distinguishing biological structures from noise is difficult.

Method: Leverages multiple perturbed predictions through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency across outputs. Introduces a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment to match topological features without ground truth.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach effectively reduces topological errors and produces more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully preserves biologically meaningful topological structures in semi-supervised histopathology segmentation, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy through topological consistency enforcement.

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

### [13] [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540)
*Jiamu Bai,Xin Yu,Meilong Xu,Weitao Lu,Xin Pan,Kiwan Maeng,Daniel Kifer,Jian Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-LPO extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to handle listwise preferences in diffusion models, enabling better alignment with human preferences by considering entire ranked lists of images rather than just pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO applications for diffusion models rely on pairwise preferences, but human feedback often contains implicit ranked information that provides more precise preference data. Listwise optimization remains largely unaddressed in diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-LPO framework that aggregates user feedback into ranked lists of images and derives a listwise extension of DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. It enforces consistency across entire rankings by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all lower-ranked alternatives.

Result: Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines across various tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment, showing improvements in visual quality and preference alignment.

Conclusion: Listwise preference optimization through Diffusion-LPO provides a more effective approach for aligning diffusion models with human preferences compared to pairwise methods, leveraging richer ranked information from human feedback.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: Bridge is a pure autoregressive unified multimodal large language model that enables both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework using a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified MLLMs face challenges: hybrid approaches break the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches struggle with trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity.

Method: Augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks with only 7.9% increase in sequence length, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Conclusion: Bridge successfully demonstrates that pure autoregressive unified MLLMs can achieve strong performance in both understanding and generation tasks with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

### [15] [Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01547)
*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Bayesian deep learning model for oral cancer classification using small datasets achieves 94% accuracy on similar test data and 88% accuracy on diverse real-world data, outperforming traditional CNNs (72.94%) through uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer has high mortality rates, especially in underserved regions. Early diagnosis is hindered by limited healthcare access, infrastructure, and practitioners. Traditional deep learning models are overconfident, require large datasets, and lack reliability in data-scarce settings.

Method: Proposed a hybrid model combining CNN with Bayesian deep learning using variational inference for uncertainty quantification. Trained on smartphone-captured photographic color images with small datasets and evaluated on three distinct test datasets.

Result: Achieved 94% accuracy on similar distribution test data (comparable to traditional CNN). Superior generalizability with 88% accuracy on diverse real-world datasets vs 72.94% for traditional CNNs. Model showed low uncertainty for correct classifications and high uncertainty for misclassifications.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference effectively enhances model reliability and generalizability in data-scarce environments, improving early oral cancer diagnosis by providing uncertainty quantification and better performance with limited training data.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

### [16] [Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559)
*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Kangyang Luo,Qin Li,and Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADTrans is a source-free domain adaptation method that constructs invariable feature representations using assistant domains and multiple consistency strategies to handle hard samples and domain bias, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA methods struggle with hard samples and domain bias because they can't access source domain data to obtain deterministic invariable features, limiting their ability to adequately represent diversity.

Method: Uses an assistant domain module to get diversified representations from intermediate global attentions, employs multiple consistent strategies to obtain invariable features for distinguishing easy/hard samples, and applies conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) to align hard samples with easy ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126 benchmarks show significant performance improvements compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CADTrans effectively addresses SFDA challenges by constructing domain-consistent invariable feature representations and properly handling hard samples through assistant domains and consistency strategies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a system that uses historical BLV users' visual questions to guide MLLMs in generating more contextually-relevant image descriptions, reducing irrelevant details and improving user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based visual interpretation applications for BLV users provide comprehensive but often irrelevant lengthy descriptions, leading to inefficient information exchanges where users must sift through unnecessary details.

Method: Developed a system that identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses associated historical BLV users' questions to guide MLLMs in generating more relevant descriptions.

Result: Context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70/92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50/92) over context-free descriptions.

Conclusion: Using historical BLV users' visual questions to guide MLLMs significantly improves the relevance and efficiency of image descriptions for BLV users.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

### [19] [NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608)
*Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdr√≥n-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NPN introduces a novel regularization method that promotes solutions in low-dimensional projections of the sensing matrix's null-space using neural networks, improving reconstruction fidelity across various imaging inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional priors ignore the task-specific structure of the null-space in imaging inverse problems, leading to suboptimal solutions. NPN addresses this by focusing on the null-space structure orthogonal to what the sensing process can capture.

Method: Proposes Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN) - a regularization approach that uses neural networks to create low-dimensional projections of the sensing matrix's null-space, rather than enforcing constraints in the image domain.

Result: NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity across diverse sensing matrices and imaging problems including compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, CT, and MRI, working with various reconstruction frameworks.

Conclusion: NPN provides interpretable and flexible regularization that captures null-space structure orthogonal to sensing capabilities, complementing conventional priors and improving reconstruction accuracy with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making for medical automation and robotic systems, providing reliable foundations for clinical automation in genomic medicine.

Method: Combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) using biologically meaningful concepts (GC content, CpG density, k-mer motifs), with reliability enhancements including concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art classification performance for HIV subtypes across in-house and LANL datasets, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost-benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed system establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine by delivering interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological priors and reducing unnecessary retests through cost-aware recommendations.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced Vision-Language-Action model that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution, achieving superior generalization and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, emit final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations, and have post-training pipelines that rarely reinforce reasoning quality with weak reward design.

Method: Integrates RLVR with GRPO for systematic optimization, designs RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, and develops VLA-CoT-13K dataset with chain-of-thought supervision aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations.

Result: Extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

Conclusion: VLA-R1 addresses key limitations in current VLA models by enhancing reasoning capabilities through verifiable rewards and specialized training data, leading to improved robustness and execution accuracy in embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We

*Yifan Zhao,Liangchen Li,Yuqi Zhou,Kai Wang,Yan Liang,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography that simultaneously optimizes clear 3D models and defocus blur kernels using differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defocus blur in macrophotography hinders clear imaging and high-quality 3D reconstruction, while traditional methods require many images and annotations with no existing multi-view 3D reconstruction solutions for macrophotography.

Method: Joint optimization of clear 3D model and defocus blur kernel for each pixel using differentiable rendering to self-supervise the optimization process from multi-view blurry images.

Result: Method achieves high-quality image deblurring and recovers high-fidelity 3D appearance from a small number of multi-view images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the defocus blur problem in macrophotography and enables joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction from limited multi-view images.

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FideDiff is a novel single-step diffusion model for high-fidelity motion deblurring that reformulates deblurring as a diffusion process and trains a consistency model to enable accurate one-step deblurring with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for image deblurring face challenges with slow inference time and compromised fidelity, limiting their practical application despite their strong generative capabilities compared to CNN and transformer methods.

Method: Reformulates motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents progressively blurred images, trains a consistency model to align all timesteps to clean images using matched blur trajectories, integrates Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation, and introduces adaptive timestep prediction.

Result: Achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpasses previous diffusion-based methods, and matches the performance of other state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks and establishes a robust baseline for advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale dataset and two-stage pipeline for bronze inscription recognition, addressing challenges like visual degradation and multi-domain variability through a novel LadderMoE architecture that improves cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bronze inscriptions are crucial for archaeological studies but face recognition challenges due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability (photographs, rubbings, tracings), and extremely long-tailed character distribution.

Method: Developed a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline with LadderMoE architecture that augments CLIP encoder with ladder-style MoE adapters for dynamic expert specialization and robustness across heterogeneous domains.

Result: The method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy across head, mid, and tail character categories as well as all acquisition modalities (photographs, rubbings, tracings).

Conclusion: The approach establishes a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition and downstream archaeological analysis, with the curated dataset enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA proposes a parameter-efficient domain adaptation method using visual reprogramming layers instead of full backbone fine-tuning, achieving competitive accuracy with only ~1.7% of parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods require fine-tuning entire backbones for each source-target pair, leading to linear growth in parameters and storage, and preventing backbone reuse across domains.

Method: VirDA prepends domain-specific visual reprogramming layers to the backbone that produce visual prompts acting as textural bias to adapt image style to target domains, without modifying backbone parameters.

Result: On Office-31, VirDA achieves 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M trainable parameters, outperforming PDA by +1.6% accuracy using 46% of its parameters, and trading off only 2.2% and 1.1% accuracy compared to PMTrans and TVT while using ~1.7% of their parameters.

Conclusion: Visual reprogramming enables parameter-efficient domain adaptation by reusing backbone parameters across domains while achieving competitive performance, addressing the scalability limitations of traditional UDA approaches.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: DFE is an unsupervised method that creates a compact dictionary of facial expressions using 3DMM and RVQ-VAE, outperforming FACS in psychological tasks like stress and depression detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial expression coding systems like FACS have limited coverage and require costly manual annotation, creating a need for scalable, data-driven alternatives.

Method: Extract identity-invariant expression features using 3DMM, then encode them with RVQ-VAE to produce discrete tokens from a shared codebook, each representing reusable facial deformation patterns.

Result: DFE captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and outperforms FACS-based pipelines and representation learning models in stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection tasks.

Conclusion: DFE serves as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications, covering a wider variety of facial displays.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Con-NRSfM is a novel method for non-rigid structure-from-motion that handles conformal deformations, using point-wise reconstruction with 2D image warps and a graph-based optimization framework to accurately compute local conformal scale and depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NRSfM methods rely on strict assumptions like locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, fail to recover conformal scale, and cannot separate depth and conformal scale constraints, limiting their accuracy in monocular visual deformable SLAM applications.

Method: Uses point-wise reconstruction with 2D selected image warps optimized through graph-based framework, employs parallel separable iterative optimization strategy, and incorporates self-supervised learning with encoder-decoder network for dense 3D point cloud generation.

Result: Demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches on both synthetic and real datasets, successfully recovering local conformal scale and enabling more precise depth estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed Con-NRSfM method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by eliminating restrictive assumptions and decoupling depth/conformal scale constraints, providing a robust solution for non-rigid structure-from-motion under conformal deformations.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse is a unified framework that decouples robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images into restoration and reconstruction subtasks, using a video diffusion model to restore consistency before reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images rely heavily on dense observations and complex per-view degradation modeling, which limits their applicability and robustness.

Method: Proposes UniVerse framework that: 1) converts inconsistent images into initial videos, 2) uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, 3) reconstructs 3D scenes from restored images. Leverages diffusion model's scene prior from large-scale data instead of case-by-case degradation modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong generalization capability and superior performance in robust reconstruction. The method can also control the style of reconstructed 3D scenes.

Conclusion: UniVerse effectively addresses the challenge of robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images by decoupling the problem and leveraging diffusion model priors, achieving better performance and generalization than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [29] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight end-to-end framework for template matching that jointly estimates position, rotation, and scaling through template-aware dynamic convolution and geometric regression, achieving high precision with 14ms inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template matching methods are inefficient due to exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, while deep learning approaches lack explicit geometric pose modeling, making them inadequate for real-world industrial deployment.

Method: Proposes a framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and geometric regression using Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) to inject template features, depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency, and rotation-shear-based augmentation with pseudo labels for geometric-annotation-free training.

Result: The 3.07M parameter model achieves high precision with 14ms inference time under compound transformations, demonstrating strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications, offering efficient and precise template matching with explicit geometric pose estimation.

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive pixel reasoning framework for Vision-Language Models that dynamically determines when to use pixel-level operations based on query difficulty, achieving superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding of fine-grained visual elements due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Current pixel-level approaches are often inefficient and distracted by irrelevant details.

Method: First applies operation-aware supervised fine-tuning for baseline competence, then uses a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework that enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty.

Result: Achieves 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining only 20.1% tool usage ratio, improving accuracy and reducing tool usage by 66.5% compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The adaptive pixel reasoning framework enables VLMs to achieve better performance while being more efficient by dynamically controlling pixel-level operations based on query requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ASRS framework using augmentation sensitivity to identify error-prone chest X-ray cases, improving fairness and reliability in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness and reliability concerns in chest radiograph interpretation where models show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups and existing error detection methods struggle with subtle within-distribution errors.

Method: Uses augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) with clinically plausible rotations (¬±15¬∞/¬±30¬∞) and measures embedding shifts using RAD-DINO encoder to stratify samples into stability quartiles.

Result: Highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall (-0.2 to -0.3) despite high AUROC and confidence, enabling identification of error-prone cases.

Conclusion: ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

*Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Ke Zhang,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeViS is a training-free video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style details and strong temporal coherence by integrating multiple stylized references to a pretrained image-to-video model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods either suffer from temporal inconsistency when applied frame-by-frame or require expensive training with paired video data, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: The framework integrates multiple stylized references to a pretrained I2V model, uses high-frequency compensation to constrain content layout and motion, and employs flow-based motion cues to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions.

Result: FreeViS achieves higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency compared to recent baselines, with strong human preference in evaluations.

Conclusion: FreeViS provides a practical and economic training-free solution for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization without requiring expensive training or paired video data.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: MedQ-Bench introduces a comprehensive benchmark for medical image quality assessment using MLLMs, featuring perception and reasoning tasks across multiple imaging modalities with human-AI alignment validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical IQA approaches are limited by scalar score-based metrics and fail to capture human-like reasoning processes used by clinical experts, creating a gap in effective AI evaluation.

Method: Developed MedQ-Bench with two tasks: MedQ-Perception for low-level visual attribute assessment and MedQ-Reasoning for no-reference and comparison tasks. Used 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments across 5 imaging modalities and 40+ quality attributes, including clinical, degraded, and AI-generated images.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs showed preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use, highlighting current limitations in medical IQA capabilities.

Conclusion: MedQ-Bench establishes a foundation for advancing MLLMs in medical image quality evaluation and identifies the need for targeted optimization to achieve clinically reliable performance.

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

TL;DR: InstaFormer is a network that predicts full occlusion and depth orderings for all instances in a scene from a single RGB image input, using interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding instance-wise geometries require expensive input formats (category labels, segmentation masks) and have high inference costs (quadratic forward passes), which limits their practical application.

Method: InstaFormer uses interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information, enabling holistic order prediction in a single forward pass.

Result: The approach is comprehensively benchmarked and ablated to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting occlusion and depth orderings.

Conclusion: InstaFormer provides an efficient solution for instance-wise geometry understanding that eliminates the need for expensive inputs and reduces inference costs to a single forward pass.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

TL;DR: PyramidStyler is a transformer-based neural style transfer framework with pyramidal positional encoding and reinforcement learning that achieves real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with significant improvements in content and style preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and transformer-based neural style transfer models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs, creating a need for more efficient and effective solutions.

Method: Proposed PyramidStyler framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE) for hierarchical multi-scale feature capture, combined with reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize stylization and accelerate convergence.

Result: Reduced content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs with 1.39s inference time; further improved to content loss 2.03 and style loss 0.75 with minimal speed penalty (1.40s) using RL.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with broad applications in media and design, successfully addressing scalability and efficiency challenges in neural style transfer.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

TL;DR: LoBE-GS is a load-balanced and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that addresses scalability issues in large scenes through depth-aware partitioning and optimization-based load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large unbounded scenes like city blocks is challenging due to memory constraints and load imbalance in existing divide-and-conquer methods.

Method: Introduces depth-aware partitioning for fast preprocessing, optimization-based load balancing using visible Gaussians as computational proxy, and lightweight techniques including visibility cropping and selective densification.

Result: Achieves up to 2√ó faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS provides an effective solution for scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large urban and outdoor scenes through re-engineered pipeline design and load balancing strategies.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: MemoryPack enables long-form video generation by modeling short- and long-term dependencies with linear complexity, while Direct Forcing reduces error accumulation in autoregressive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video generation faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and preventing error accumulation in autoregressive decoding.

Method: Propose MemoryPack for dynamic context modeling using textual and image information as global guidance, and Direct Forcing for efficient single-step approximation to improve training-inference alignment.

Result: Achieves minute-level temporal consistency, scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity.

Conclusion: MemoryPack and Direct Forcing enhance context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods for confidence calibration in 3D object detectors, focusing on both dominant and secondary class predictions, and evaluates their effectiveness on CenterPoint, PillarNet, and DSVT-Pillar models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for autonomous systems to ensure self-aware and safe operation, particularly for the classification task in 3D object detectors.

Method: The authors propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms that introduce calibration of either the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as training goals, and evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods.

Result: Combining the proposed loss term for full class prediction calibration with isotonic regression achieves the best calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet, while DSVT-Pillar cannot be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.

Conclusion: Different 3D object detectors require tailored calibration approaches, and the proposed method effectively calibrates CenterPoint and PillarNet but not DSVT-Pillar for both dominant and secondary class predictions.

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

TL;DR: DiffPS leverages pre-trained diffusion models to address optimization conflicts in person search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing person search methods use ImageNet pre-trained backbones that are suboptimal for capturing spatial context and fine-grained identity cues, and suffer from conflicting optimization objectives between detection and re-identification tasks.

Method: Proposes three specialized modules: Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for better localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to reduce shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to utilize text-aligned diffusion features.

Result: DiffPS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging diffusion model priors effectively resolves optimization conflicts in person search and improves both localization and identification performance.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

TL;DR: FMU integrates flow matching into HSI reconstruction using a deep unfolding framework with mean velocity loss for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI is costly to acquire and existing compressive sensing systems like CASSI struggle with accurate reconstruction due to severe degradation and loss of spectral details.

Method: Proposes Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU) that embeds flow matching generative prior within deep unfolding framework, with mean velocity loss for global consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets show FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: FMU successfully combines interpretability of optimization-based methods with generative capacity of flow matching for superior HSI reconstruction.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Motivation: Conventional defect detection is time-consuming and labor-intensive, creating burdens for quality inspection personnel and making product quality management difficult.

Method: Uses digital camera optics and deep learning models (YOLOv3, v4, v7, v9) with ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address lack of defective images. Focuses on surface and pin-leg defects in DIP components.

Result: YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN achieved best performance: 95.50% accuracy and 285 ms detection time, significantly outperforming threshold-based approaches. Also developed SCADA system with sensor architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed automated defect detection system can be easily established for various defect types and works well even with insufficient defect data, providing an efficient solution for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD is a few-shot anomaly detection method that uses foundation visual encoders and learns a nonlinear projection operator to identify anomalies by detecting out-of-distribution regions in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot anomaly detection faces challenges in differentiating normal and abnormal features with limited samples, especially under category-agnostic conditions. Foundation visual encoders can help learn general distributions of normal images.

Method: The method learns a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold, utilizing the correlation between anomaly amount and embedding differences from foundation encoders to detect out-of-distribution regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance with multi-class detection capability while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Works with multiple foundation encoders including DINOv3.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances few-shot anomaly detection by providing an effective tool for anomaly characterization with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

*Fabio Montello,Ronja G√ºldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT is a Vision Transformer architecture that reduces computational complexity for semantic segmentation by merging similar tokens using a trainable Cluster module and restoring details with a Regenerator module, achieving significant speedup with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have quadratic attention complexity that limits their practical use in real-world robotic systems, and existing token merging methods work well for classification but are less suitable for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Expand Vision Transformer backbone with a trainable Cluster module that merges similar tokens guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks, followed by a Regenerator module that restores fine details for downstream heads.

Result: Achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different datasets while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: ClustViT effectively addresses the computational complexity limitations of Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation tasks, making them more practical for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaDT introduces a unified paradigm for MLLMs to directly generate both textual and visual outputs using Visual Reference Tokens, enabling dense prediction tasks like detection and segmentation without relying on indirect text representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches for vision tasks rely on indirect representations like generating coordinates as text, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

Method: PaDT uses Visual Reference Tokens derived from visual patch embeddings, interleaved with LLM's textual tokens, processed independently at each forward pass with dynamic embedding table expansion. A lightweight decoder transforms outputs into visual predictions, trained with random VRT selection and per-token cross-entropy loss.

Result: Empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks show PaDT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT provides a unified framework that enables MLLMs to directly generate diverse visual outputs, overcoming limitations of indirect representations and enabling dense prediction tasks while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

### [45] [TriAlignXA: An Explainable Trilemma Alignment Framework for Trustworthy Agri-product Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01990)
*Jianfei Xie,Ziyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses trust issues in online produce e-commerce by proposing a 'Trust Pyramid' model and 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI) to quantify quality trade-offs. It introduces TriAlignXA, an explainable AI framework that redefines algorithms as transparent decision-making providers, using three optimization engines to balance biological characteristics, timeliness, and economic viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce arises from the inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of product quality, which traditional absolute grading standards fail to address due to the 'impossible triangle' constraints in agricultural product grading.

Method: The study constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through 'dual-source verification' and proposes the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI) to quantitatively assess trade-offs. It designs the TriAlignXA explainable AI framework with three engines: Bio-Adaptive Engine for quality description, Timeliness Optimization Engine for processing efficiency, and Economic Optimization Engine for cost control. A 'Pre-Mapping Mechanism' encodes process data into QR codes for transparent quality communication.

Result: Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the framework's balancing capability in addressing the 'impossible triangle' of agricultural product grading constraints.

Conclusion: The research provides comprehensive support from theory to practice for building a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust by redefining algorithms as providers of transparent decision-making bases rather than decision-makers.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

*Lei Liu,Can Wang,Zhenghao Chen,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft is a consistent and interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting editing framework that addresses view, temporal, and region consistency issues while handling complex text instructions through LLM-based intent understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in 4DGS editing including view inconsistency, temporal inconsistency, non-editing region inconsistency, and difficulty in handling complex text instructions.

Method: Uses 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix with 4D VGGT geometry features, multi-view grid module for iterative refinement, Gaussian selection mechanism for region preservation, and LLM-based module for intent understanding and operation decomposition.

Result: Enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing compared to related works, with improved handling of complex user commands.

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft provides a comprehensive solution for consistent and interactive 4DGS editing that maintains consistency across views, time, and regions while effectively interpreting user intent.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels to exempt them from expensive computations in image super-resolution, achieving better performance than CAMixer with similar computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing lightweight SR methods like CAMixer, including poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking, and spatial inflexibility in computational allocation.

Method: Uses fixed color center points to classify pixels into categories, enabling fine-grained pixel-level masking that exempts pure pixels from expensive computations while maintaining adaptive flexibility.

Result: PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in both reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency while saving similar computational costs.

Conclusion: Pure-Pass provides an effective pixel-level masking approach for computational efficiency in image super-resolution, offering improved adaptability and spatial flexibility over existing methods.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: This study developed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework using GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs, achieving improved accuracy over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of automated jaw cyst findings generation on dental panoramic radiographs by addressing inconsistencies and hallucinations in conventional AI methods.

Method: Implemented a 10-step SLSO framework including image analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction with consistency checking, iterative regeneration for inconsistencies, and finding generation with restructuring and verification. Compared against conventional Chain-of-Thought method across 7 evaluation items.

Result: SLSO framework showed 66.9% improvement for tooth number accuracy, 33.3% for tooth movement, and 28.6% for root resorption. Successful cases achieved consistent structured output after up to 5 regenerations. The framework enforced negative finding descriptions and suppressed hallucinations.

Conclusion: The SLSO framework improves output accuracy for jaw cyst findings but requires further refinement for extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth. The approach shows promise for practical finding generation systems despite dataset size limitations.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Method: Proposed LiLa-Net architecture with reduced encoder layers and simplified skip connections to create an efficient latent space for point cloud reconstruction, leveraging data from a real semi-autonomous vehicle equipped with Velodyne LiDAR.

Result: The model achieves effective balance between skip connection information and latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without performance compromise, and demonstrates strong generalization by reconstructing objects outside the original traffic environment.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net successfully creates an efficient 3D autoencoder for LiDAR point clouds that maintains reconstruction accuracy while using fewer resources than state-of-the-art methods, with demonstrated generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which

improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization

Motivation: Traditional field observations are limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering comprehensive assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes.

Method: Integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems including object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage.

Result: Drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity (15% reduction in visibility loss), captured more transitions with higher accuracy, and analyzed 969 behavioral sequences. Found species-specific behavioral patterns in zebras and spatial segregation in mixed-species herds.

Conclusion: kabr-tools enables automated behavioral monitoring at scale, offering a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies that advances conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework enables high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling with geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints, achieving both local detail preservation and global semantic coherence without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InPose: A zero-shot generalization method for pose estimation using diffusion models conditioned on rotational measurements alone, guided by location-based likelihood terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods using conditional diffusion models generalize poorly across users because location measurements are highly influenced by body size variations.

Method: Formulates pose estimation as an inverse problem using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned only on rotational measurements, guided by a likelihood term derived from measured locations.

Result: The proposed InPose method can generatively estimate pose sequences that best explain sparse on-body measurements for any user without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: InPose enables zero-shot generalization across users by decoupling rotational conditioning from body-size-dependent location measurements through an inverse problem formulation.

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional architectures like U-Net have limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies, which constrains performance on complex brain tumor structures. Diffusion models show strong potential for medical image analysis but need better integration with global contextual reasoning.

Method: The proposed VGDM framework embeds a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, leveraging global contextual reasoning with iterative denoising. This hybrid approach combines transformer modeling of spatial relationships across MRI volumes with diffusion refinement to reduce voxel-level errors.

Result: Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets shows consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance metrics, demonstrating improved volumetric accuracy and boundary precision compared to conventional U-Net baselines.

Conclusion: The transformer-guided diffusion model provides improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, advancing the state of the art in tumor segmentation by effectively combining global contextual modeling with fine-grained diffusion refinement.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a scalable deep learning pipeline using dual-pass U-Net to extract urban areas from historical French maps (1925-1950), creating the first national-scale urban footprint dataset for this period with 73% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data for historical urban sprawl analysis in France before the 1970s, which hinders quantitative studies of long-term urbanization dynamics.

Method: A dual-pass U-Net approach: first pass generates preliminary map to identify confusing areas (text, roads) for targeted data augmentation; second pass uses refined dataset and binarized output from first model to minimize radiometric noise and reduce false positives.

Result: Successfully processed 941 high-resolution tiles covering all of metropolitan France, achieving 73% overall accuracy while effectively capturing diverse urban patterns and overcoming artifacts like labels and contour lines.

Conclusion: The study provides the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for France's pivotal 1925-1950 period, with released code, training datasets, and resulting raster to support future urbanization research.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

*Woowon Jang,Jiwon Im,Juseung Choi,Niki Rashidian,Wesley De Neve,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-based tracking in surgical videos is competitive for tools but underperforms for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos and understand its reliability in complex surgical environments.

Method: Compared point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization for three surgical targets (gallbladder, grasper, L-hook electrocautery) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos.

Result: Point-based tracking performs well for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries cause tracking failures.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis, highlighting the limitations of point-based tracking for anatomical structures.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FRIEREN framework for Federated Learning with unlabeled client data, leveraging Vision Foundation Models and CLIP embeddings to handle domain shifts without re-accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Federated Learning for Semantic Segmentation where client data is unlabeled and faces domain shifts, while most existing methods assume labeled data or don't leverage modern Vision Foundation Models.

Method: Uses Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings for semantic disambiguation, and weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks.

Conclusion: FRIEREN effectively tackles the new FFREEDG task and sets a strong baseline for future research in federated learning with unlabeled data and domain shifts.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint is a structured prompting framework that uses action-centric knowledge to improve video anomaly detection with frozen vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance through fine-grained guiding questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting methods for video anomaly detection are too abstract and overlook fine-grained human-object interactions and action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos.

Method: Organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g., violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show consistent AUC improvements over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods.

Conclusion: ASK-Hint demonstrates the critical role of prompt granularity and establishes itself as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection with strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

*Weijia Dou,Xu Zhang,Yi Bin,Jian Liu,Bo Peng,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify is a method that uses geometric priors from 3D self-supervised learning to purify noisy 2D VLM features for 3D semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1.5% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for transferring 2D Vision-Language Model features to 3D semantic segmentation face a trade-off: direct projection yields noisy results while geometric coherence requires expensive training pipelines and large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes GeoPurify with a Student Affinity Network that purifies 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors from a 3D self-supervised teacher model, plus a Geometry-Guided Pooling module for inference-time denoising.

Result: Extensive experiments show GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on major 3D benchmarks while using only about 1.5% of training data.

Conclusion: GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off between 2D semantics and 3D geometry in feature transfer, demonstrating superior data efficiency and performance through latent geometric information exploitation.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noninvasive pig identification using auricular vein patterns achieves 98.12% accuracy with SVM classification, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods like ear tags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pig identification methods (ear tags, microchips) are unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and impractical for small-scale farmers, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: Collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed pigs using smartphone with back lighting; developed multistage computer vision pipeline to enhance vein visibility and extract structural/spatial features; used machine learning models for classification.

Result: Support Vector Machines achieved 98.12% precision in pig identification across mixed-breed populations; entire process completed in average 8.3 seconds, demonstrating real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Auricular vein biometrics provide a cost-effective, stress-free alternative to physical identifiers, confirming practicality for digitizing livestock management and extending precision farming benefits to resource-constrained communities.

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

TL;DR: A multicategory counting framework using Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone with multi-class counting head and Category Focus Module, achieving significant MAE reduction on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object counting in dense and occluded scenes where traditional detection methods fail, particularly for multi-category scenarios with inter-category interference.

Method: Uses Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone with specialized multi-class counting head based on multiscale decoding. Includes Category Focus Module for segmentation-based inter-category suppression during training.

Result: 33%, 43% and 64% reduction in MAE compared to prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks. Outperforms YOLOv11 in dense scenes.

Conclusion: The method's regional loss enables multi-class crowd counting in new domains, demonstrated through biodiversity monitoring applications for conservation and ecological insights.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

*Shira Schiber,Ofir Lindenbaum,Idan Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempoControl enables fine-grained temporal control in text-to-video generation by using cross-attention maps to align visual concepts with timing signals during inference, without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models lack precise temporal control, preventing users from specifying when specific visual elements should appear in generated sequences.

Method: Uses cross-attention maps from diffusion models with a novel optimization approach that aligns temporal shape via correlation, amplifies visibility via energy, and maintains spatial focus via entropy.

Result: Enables precise timing control while maintaining high video quality and diversity, demonstrated in applications like temporal reordering and audio-aligned generation.

Conclusion: TempoControl provides effective temporal alignment for video generation without requiring additional training or supervision, expanding creative control possibilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardMap is a multi-stage RL framework that addresses sparse reward challenges in fine-grained visual reasoning for MLLMs by introducing dense rewards through VQA tasks and a difficulty-aware training scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured settings like transit maps, and standard RL approaches are impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization.

Method: Proposed RewardMap framework with: 1) ReasonMap-Plus dataset with dense VQA rewards, 2) Difficulty-aware reward design with detail rewards, 3) Multi-stage RL scheme from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Models trained with RewardMap achieve 3.47% average improvement across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps.

Conclusion: RewardMap effectively addresses sparse reward challenges in fine-grained visual reasoning, demonstrating enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities in MLLMs through multi-stage RL training.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

*Zihan Zhou,Shilin Lu,Shuli Leng,Shaocong Zhang,Zhuming Lian,Xinlei Yu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow is the first framework to effectively use FLUX's strong generative priors for drag-based image editing, overcoming limitations of previous methods by introducing region-based editing with affine transformations and integrating personalization adapters for better subject consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous drag-based editing methods suffered from distortions due to insufficient priors from Stable Diffusion. With the shift to stronger DiT models like FLUX, there's an opportunity to improve drag editing, but existing point-based approaches don't work well with DiT's unstructured features.

Method: Proposes DragFlow with region-based editing using affine transformations for richer feature supervision, integrates IP-Adapter for subject consistency, uses gradient mask constraints for background preservation, and employs MLLMs to resolve task ambiguities.

Result: DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines on DragBench-DR and the new ReD Bench benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art performance in drag-based image editing.

Conclusion: The work successfully leverages FLUX's strong priors for drag-based editing through region-based supervision and comprehensive constraints, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

*Guangyu Sun,Archit Singhal,Burak Uzkent,Mubarak Shah,Chen Chen,Garin Kessler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2C proposes using key clips instead of isolated key frames for video understanding in VLMs, with adaptive resolution to maintain constant token count, achieving significant performance improvements on long-form video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs face the 'needle in a haystack' problem where massive visual tokens from raw video frames exhaust context windows. Existing frame-wise selection methods discard temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity.

Method: Extend selection from isolated key frames to key clips (short, temporally coherent segments) and use adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length to maintain constant token count per video.

Result: Outperforms uniform sampling by up to 8.1% on Video-MME, 5.6% on LongVideoBench, and 10.3% on MLVU benchmarks. Training-free approach demonstrates the importance of preserving temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Preserving temporal coherence through key clips with adaptive resolution provides a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real-world video understanding applications.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with IMUs for movement assessment, finding MotionAGFormer performs best among video methods, with both technologies viable for out-of-lab kinematic assessment but with trade-offs in cost, accessibility, and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate human movement assessment under real-world conditions for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation by comparing video-based and IMU-based approaches.

Method: Used the VIDIMU dataset with 13 daily activities captured by commodity cameras and 5 IMUs. Evaluated joint angles from deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose, NVIDIA BodyTrack) against IMU data processed through OpenSim inverse kinematics, following Human3.6M format with 17 keypoints.

Result: MotionAGFormer achieved best performance with lowest RMSE (9.27¬∞¬±4.80¬∞), lowest MAE (7.86¬∞¬±4.18¬∞), highest Pearson correlation (0.86¬±0.15), and highest R¬≤ (0.67¬±0.28). Both video and IMU approaches are viable for out-of-lab kinematic assessment.

Conclusion: The study provides guidelines for developing robust, cost-effective telehealth solutions, clarifying where video models provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates, highlighting key trade-offs between the two approaches.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

TL;DR: NeuroSwift is a diffusion-based method that integrates AutoKL and CLIP adapters for cross-subject fMRI visual reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training time and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with accurate cross-subject visual reconstruction from fMRI due to inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract semantic encoding of complex visual inputs.

Method: Proposes NeuroSwift which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. Uses pretraining on one subject followed by fine-tuning only 17% of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects while freezing other components.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift enables efficient and accurate cross-subject visual reconstruction from fMRI data through its innovative adapter integration and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

### [67] [microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270)
*Sathira Silva,Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: microCLIP is a self-training framework that enhances CLIP's fine-grained classification by introducing saliency-guided token fusion and LLM-derived classifiers to align coarse and fine visual-textual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's reliance on coarse global features limits its performance on fine-grained classification tasks, and previous methods using LLM descriptions overlook spatial precision needed for microscopic local cues.

Method: Proposes Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) in TokenFusion module to create saliency-guided [FG] token, fuses it with global [CLS] token, and uses two-headed LLM-derived classifier with Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation for stable pseudo-labeling.

Result: Achieves consistent 2.90% average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Conclusion: microCLIP effectively uncovers latent fine-grained signals in CLIP through joint refinement of visual and textual representations, enabling improved fine-grained classification with minimal adaptation cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1 is the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to detect AI-generated videos with both high accuracy and interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks from AI-generated videos, such as misinformation and reputational harm, requiring both accurate classification and interpretable explanations for transparency.

Method: Fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models targeting temporal artifacts and generation complexity, trained on a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos from state-of-the-art generation models.

Result: VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%, and produces precise and interpretable rationales for its predictions.

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1 successfully addresses the need for both accurate detection and interpretable explanations in AI-generated video detection, demonstrating superior performance and transparency through its MLLM-based approach with GRPO fine-tuning.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without needing long-video supervision, using teacher model guidance on self-generated long videos to maintain temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for video generation suffer from high computational costs with transformers and quality degradation when extending to long videos due to error compounding in autoregressive formulations.

Method: Uses teacher models to provide guidance for student models through sampled segments from self-generated long videos, maintaining temporal consistency without recomputing overlapping frames.

Result: Achieves video generation up to 4 minutes 15 seconds (50x longer than baseline), substantially outperforms baselines in fidelity and consistency on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring long-video supervision or retraining, enabling significantly longer video generation while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

*David Romero,Ariana Bermudez,Hao Li,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMask is a physics-guided video generation method that enables realistic rigid body control and interactions by using object velocity inputs and a two-stage training strategy with gradual removal of motion supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms, limiting their use as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making.

Method: Two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks, training video diffusion models on synthetic scenes with simple interactions, and integrating low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning.

Result: Significant improvements in object interactions in real scenes, strong improvements over recent models of comparable size, and effective synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena.

Conclusion: KineMask successfully addresses limitations in physics-grounded video generation through its novel training approach and conditioning mechanisms, demonstrating complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in video diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces fine-grained multimodal actions for household robots, incorporating proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation to enable precise real-time control that text-conditioned models struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models fail as world models due to lack of fine-grained control, and household robots need real-time fine motor control for delicate tasks and urgent situations.

Method: Developed a feature learning paradigm that aligns multiple sensory modalities while preserving unique information from each, with a regularization scheme to enhance causality of action trajectory features.

Result: Experiments show incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift, with extensive ablation studies demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult for text-conditioned generative models, showing practical effectiveness for household robot applications.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNSA adapts Native Sparse Attention to video-language models, enabling reliable scaling to 128K tokens and improved performance on long-video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding in multimodal language models is limited by context length, causing models to miss key transition frames and struggle with coherence across long time scales.

Method: Adapts Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models by adapting Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset, using hardware-aware hybrid attention (dense for text, sparse for video).

Result: Achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines.

Conclusion: Key findings include reliable scaling to 128K tokens, optimal global-local attention allocation, task-dependent branch usage patterns, and learnable combined sparse attention inducing dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

### [73] [NoiseShift: Resolution-Aware Noise Recalibration for Better Low-Resolution Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02307)
*Ruozhen He,Moayed Haji-Ali,Ziyan Yang,Vicente Ordonez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift is a training-free method that recalibrates noise levels in diffusion models based on resolution size to improve low-resolution image generation quality without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on fixed resolutions fail to generalize to lower resolutions, preventing budget-efficient alternatives for users who don't need high-resolution images.

Method: Identifies that noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions, then recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size without changing model architecture or sampling schedule.

Result: Significantly improves quality at low resolutions: SD3.5 improved by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on LAION-COCO; SD3.5 improved by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on CelebA.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively mitigates resolution-dependent artifacts and enhances low-resolution image generation quality in existing diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

*Guanqi Zhan,Xianzheng Ma,Weidi Xie,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies predicting dynamic physical properties (elasticity, viscosity, friction) from videos using three approaches: oracle methods with computer vision, prompt-based methods with video foundation models, and MLLMs with specialized prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable prediction of temporal physical properties from videos that require dynamic information to infer, addressing the challenge of measuring properties like elasticity, viscosity, and friction from visual data.

Method: Three approaches: (1) Oracle method using classical computer vision to extract visual cues, (2) Prompt-based readout mechanism with trainable vectors on pre-trained video models, (3) Prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Collected new video datasets for each property with synthetic and real-world splits.

Result: Video foundation models (generative and self-supervised) achieved similar performance, though behind oracle methods. MLLMs were inferior but could be improved through suitable prompting strategies.

Conclusion: Video foundation models show promise for predicting dynamic physical properties, with prompt-based methods being effective, while MLLMs need further development and better prompting strategies to match other approaches.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces sounding object detection - a task to link sounds to the objects directly involved in interactions, using a multimodal object-aware framework trained on egocentric videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Everyday object interactions produce unique sounds, and the paper aims to evaluate models' ability to distinguish between sounds of different objects (e.g., spoon hitting hardwood vs carpeted floor).

Method: Uses multimodal object-aware framework with automatic pipeline for computing segmentation masks of involved objects, guided by slot attention visual encoder to enforce object prior during training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new sounding object detection task and existing multimodal action understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully links sounds to the objects directly involved in interactions, demonstrating improved object-centric multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel density-guided poisoning attack on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions using Kernel Density Estimation, creating viewpoint-dependent illusory objects while minimally affecting innocent views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As 3D scene representation methods like NeRF and 3DGS become widely used, understanding and addressing their security vulnerabilities becomes critical. The paper aims to analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks.

Method: The method uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify low-density regions in 3D space, then strategically injects Gaussian points into these regions to create viewpoint-dependent illusory objects. An adaptive noise strategy is introduced to disrupt multi-view consistency for enhanced attack effectiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The method successfully embeds viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a systematic KDE-based evaluation protocol for assessing attack difficulty and provides objective benchmarking for future research in 3D scene representation security.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS introduces a theoretical framework using stochastic optimal control to improve multi-subject fidelity in text-to-image models, addressing issues like attribute leakage and identity entanglement through training-free test-time control and lightweight fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models perform well on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, often exhibiting attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions.

Method: Viewing flow matching through stochastic optimal control, the authors formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler, yielding two architecture-agnostic algorithms: a training-free test-time controller and Adjoint Matching for lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: Both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style across Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers generalize to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models, providing the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity and unifying prior attention heuristics through a principled theoretical framework.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented fine-tuning of LLMs is effective for accurate and generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human behavior modeling approaches are either data-hungry, make unrealistic rationality assumptions, or are computationally demanding. Many everyday social interactions follow predictable patterns that minimize cognitive load.

Method: ROTE treats action understanding as program synthesis, using LLMs to generate behavioral program hypotheses and probabilistic inference to reason about uncertainty over these programs.

Result: ROTE outperforms competitive baselines (including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods) by up to 50% in in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization in gridworld tasks and embodied household simulator.

Conclusion: Modeling human behavior as behavioral programs through program synthesis enables AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing AI systems for interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted problems in chemical engineering.

Method: Developed CA-ChemE system with domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents featuring ontology engineering capabilities for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: Knowledge base enhancement improved dialogue quality by 10-15%; Collaboration Agent achieved 8.5% improvement for distant-domain pairs vs 0.8% for proximate pairs, revealing the "knowledge-base gaps" effect.

Conclusion: Carefully designed multi-agent architectures provide a viable pathway toward autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent debate framework to evaluate emergent social behaviors in LLM-based agents, revealing strong consensus-seeking tendencies and measurable psychometric profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation benchmarks are insufficient for capturing emergent social and cognitive dynamics in autonomous LLM agents, necessitating new evaluation methods for interactive environments.

Method: A multi-agent debate framework where LLM-based agents with distinct personas deliberate on challenging topics under LLM moderator supervision, analyzed using psychometric and semantic metrics.

Result: Agents consistently reach high semantic agreement (Œº > 0.88) without explicit instruction, personas induce stable psychometric profiles, and moderator personas significantly alter debate outcomes.

Conclusion: The work provides a blueprint for dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols for agentic AI, offering methodology for understanding and shaping social behaviors in next-generation AI agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

*Yu Zeng,Wenxuan Huang,Shiting Huang,Xikun Bao,Yukun Qi,Yiming Zhao,Qiuchen Wang,Lin Chen,Zehui Chen,Huaian Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE is an agentic jigsaw interaction learning method that enhances visual perception and reasoning in VLMs through interactive jigsaw solving, achieving significant performance improvements on jigsaw tasks and strong generalization across 9 vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have limited fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities, performing poorly even on simple jigsaw tasks, and face constraints due to scarce high-quality vision-language data.

Method: AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process where the model generates executable code to perform actions based on current state, and the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion through iterative cycles.

Result: AGILE boosts jigsaw task accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under 2√ó2 setting and achieves average 3.1% improvement across 9 general vision tasks, demonstrating enhanced perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: AGILE provides an efficient, scalable solution to multimodal data scarcity and opens new avenues for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

*Darshan Deshpande,Varun Gangal,Hersh Mehta,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEMTRACK is a benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments, focusing on realistic organizational workflows across communication tools like Slack, Linear, and Git.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context and memory benchmarks primarily focus on conversational instances, but there's a crucial need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments with multiple platforms and asynchronous events.

Method: MEMTRACK integrates asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms, providing chronologically interleaved timelines with noisy, conflicting, and cross-referring information. The dataset is curated through manual expert design and scalable agent-based synthesis.

Result: Experiments show challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. The best performing GPT-5 model only achieves 60% Correctness score on MEMTRACK.

Conclusion: MEMTRACK provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents beyond conversational setups, setting the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings.

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

*Leon Garza,Anantaa Kotal,Michael A. Grasso,Emre Umucu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A clinical decision support system using LLMs to assist prescribing clinicians by analyzing EHR data and generating therapeutic suggestions through a RAG pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of clinical decision-making and leverage EHR data for data-informed care while augmenting rather than replacing clinician judgment.

Method: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates natural language processing with structured clinical inputs, harmonizing unstructured narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference.

Result: Preliminary evaluations with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets show promising clinical plausibility and consistency of model outputs.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when appropriately constrained and validated, representing an initial step toward integrating generative AI into clinical practice with emphasis on transparency and safety.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

### [86] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation) is a novel method to detect implicit reward hacking in reasoning models by measuring how early in the chain-of-thought the model can achieve high reward, identifying shortcuts that bypass traditional monitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking poses a significant threat where models exploit loopholes in reward functions without solving intended tasks. This can be implicit (not verbalized in CoT), making it undetectable by current chain-of-thought monitors.

Method: TRACE progressively truncates a model's chain-of-thought at various lengths, forces the model to answer, and measures the verifier-passing rate at each cutoff. It quantifies 'effort' by how early reasoning becomes sufficient to pass verification.

Result: TRACE achieves over 65% gains over strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over 32B monitor in coding. It can also discover unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods are ineffective, detecting implicit reward hacking by identifying when models take shortcuts requiring less effort than intended task solving.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation, improving LLM agent performance on multi-step tasks while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents frequently fail in predictable ways during multi-step tasks, and while RAG can help, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) extract compact hints from agent failures, (2) generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, (3) train student models on trajectories with hints removed to force internalization rather than memorization.

Result: Distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% baseline) and 72 WebShop score (vs. 61 baseline), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers.

Conclusion: Retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies, generalizing across model scales and agent architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

*Yang Liu,Zaid Abulawi,Abhiram Garimidi,Doyeong Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents automate data-driven modeling for regression tasks, achieving performance comparable to human-expert models on critical heat flux prediction benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional data-driven methods that require extensive manual intervention and lack scalability/generalization for scientific datasets.

Method: Two LLM-agent frameworks: multi-agent system with specialized collaborative agents, and single-agent system using ReAct paradigm. Both autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: LLM-agent-developed model outperforms traditional CHF lookup tables and achieves predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification comparable to state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural networks developed by human experts.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents show significant potential to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing performance standards.

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

*Luca Cotti,Idilio Drago,Anisa Rula,Devis Bianchini,Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX is an AI agent that uses LLMs to transform raw system logs into ontology-grounded knowledge graphs for extracting actionable cyber threat intelligence, with capabilities for session aggregation and MITRE ATT&CK tactic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System logs contain valuable cyber threat intelligence but are limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices, making it difficult to extract coherent and interoperable threat information.

Method: OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps using LLMs to generate syntactically and semantically valid knowledge graphs from raw logs, then aggregates these into sessions and predicts MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Result: Evaluation on public benchmark and real-world honeypot datasets shows robust KG generation across multiple backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics, with retrieval and correction improving precision and recall.

Conclusion: Ontology-grounded representations using LLMs with RAG and correction mechanisms are effective for extracting actionable cyber threat intelligence from unstructured system logs, with code-oriented models showing particular effectiveness in structured log analysis.

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

*Sipeng Zhang,Longfei Yun,Zilong Wang,Jingbo Shang,Letian Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer is a collaborative framework that combines LLMs' reasoning with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining, achieving similar accuracy to state-of-the-art LLMs while reducing costs by 90% and accelerating processing by 20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches have limitations: LLMs are too expensive for large-scale deployment, while traditional classifier/extractor pipelines are brittle and can't generalize to new tasks. There's a need for a scalable solution that maintains instruction-following capability.

Method: Falconer uses LLMs as planners to decompose user instructions into executable pipelines and as annotators to generate supervision for training small proxy models. It unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations (get label and get span), enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components.

Result: Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x. New benchmarks were constructed to evaluate planning and end-to-end execution consistency.

Conclusion: Falconer offers an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research by combining the strengths of LLMs' agentic reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight proxy models, addressing the scalability limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

TL;DR: Using expert-curated knowledge with explainable AI to create automated lesson generation and adaptive tutoring systems for education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the overlooked role of domain expert knowledge in AI for education and explore how curated expert knowledge can enhance tutoring systems.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Using expert-specified rules with XAI techniques to automatically generate lessons, 2) Leveraging expert-designed curricula to develop adaptive tutoring systems with more efficient algorithms.

Result: Proposed framework demonstrates how expert knowledge can be integrated with AI to create effective educational systems, with a case study on pollinator identification.

Conclusion: Expert-curated knowledge combined with XAI and adaptive algorithms can significantly improve educational tutoring systems, making them more effective and efficient.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE introduces visual uncertainty guided exploration for MLLMs by treating images as stochastic contexts, using symmetric KL divergence to quantify policy sensitivity to visual perturbations, which improves multimodal reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods for MLLMs treat visual input as fixed and deterministic, overlooking visual ambiguity and struggling with exploration, leading to policies that lack robustness to plausible visual variations.

Method: VOGUE shifts exploration from text to visual space by quantifying policy sensitivity to visual perturbations using symmetric KL divergence between raw and noisy image branches. It uses uncertainty-proportional bonus combined with token-entropy bonus and annealed sampling schedule to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models, VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by average 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while improving pass@4 performance and mitigating exploration decay in RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: AIReg-Bench is the first benchmark dataset for testing LLMs' ability to assess compliance with the EU AI Act, created through LLM-generated documentation samples and legal expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As governments regulate AI, there's growing interest in using LLMs to assess AI system compliance with regulations, but no existing benchmarks to evaluate LLM performance on this task.

Method: Created dataset through two-step process: (1) prompting LLM to generate 120 technical documentation excerpts describing fictional AI systems, (2) legal experts reviewed and annotated each sample for AIA violations.

Result: Established a benchmark dataset and evaluated whether frontier LLMs can reproduce expert compliance labels, providing insights into LLM-based AIR compliance assessment capabilities.

Conclusion: AIReg-Bench provides a starting point to understand opportunities/limitations of LLM-based compliance assessment and establishes a benchmark for comparing subsequent LLMs.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [94] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT addresses pathologies in Tree-of-Thoughts search by separating utility from logical consistency, treating low-utility but consistent candidates as assets. It uses lateral racing with short-circuit to efficiently explore wide lateral sets while keeping mainlines narrow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tree-of-Thoughts search suffers from breadth saturation (additional samples produce near-duplicates) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches with long-term payoff) when allocating large test-time compute.

Method: Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT) splits the frontier into mainlines (high-utility candidates) and laterals (consistent but low-utility candidates). Laterals are explored via Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR-SC), which uses capped successive-halving races with width-aware thresholds and immediate promotion when branches clear the mainline bar.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows pseudolinear lateral cost Œò(N‚ÇÄ log_Œ∑ N‚ÇÄ) with logarithmic rungs, contrasting with exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations are in preparation.

Conclusion: LToT turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating

*Daniel Zhao,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Lanxiang Hu,Tajana Rosing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using sparse autoencoders and clustering to analyze LLM token representations for mathematical reasoning, creating a graph-based reward system that balances exploitation (following established reasoning patterns) and exploration (generating diverse solutions) to improve reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mathematical reasoning in LLMs by analyzing internal token representations and guiding generations through a balanced approach that prevents extreme behaviors in either exploitation or exploration.

Method: Trains sparse autoencoders to generate sparse token representations, applies k-means clustering to create a graph of token clusters with weighted edges for sequential transitions, defines edge-weight based reward functions to quantify reasoning adherence, and measures generation diversity from clustering.

Result: Findings show that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks, and the SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully prevents extreme behaviors in reasoning by maintaining a balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration, ultimately fostering higher-quality reasoning processes in LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

*Navapat Nananukul,Yue Zhang,Ryan Lee,Eric Boxer,Jonathan May,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate,Jay Pujara,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGicalThought (LogT) is a neurosymbolic architecture that combines LLMs with logical reasoning to handle defeasible logic in high-assurance domains, achieving 11.84% overall performance improvement across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-assurance domains like law and medicine require accurate, verifiable reasoning with defeasible logic, but LLMs struggle with the rigorous logical reasoning needed for exceptions and non-monotonic reasoning.

Method: LogT uses a neurosymbolic approach combining an advanced logical language and reasoner with LLMs to create dual symbolic graph and logic-based contexts, transforming long-form guidelines into compact grounded evaluation.

Result: LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs, with significant gains in negation (+10.2%), implication (+13.2%), and defeasible reasoning (+5.5%) compared to strongest baselines on four multi-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic LogT architecture effectively addresses the challenges of defeasible reasoning in high-assurance domains by combining logical reasoning with LLM capabilities, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across key reasoning modes.

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

*Djengo Cyun-Jyun Fang,Tsung-Wei Ke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker is an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with active information seeking to handle uncertainty in partially observable environments, achieving 74% performance gain over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM planning agents often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and actual environments, failing to properly handle observational uncertainty and environmental dynamics.

Method: InfoSeeker prompts LLMs to actively gather information by planning actions to validate understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans.

Result: Achieves 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency, and generalizes well across LLMs and established benchmarks like robotic manipulation and web navigation.

Conclusion: Tight integration of planning and information seeking is crucial for robust behavior in partially observable environments, and InfoSeeker demonstrates this effectively.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Xiangchen Song,Xinshuai Dong,Guangyi Chen,Eric P. Xing,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion language models that addresses the problem of unstructured refinement in complex reasoning tasks by using process-based rewards to align denoising with latent reasoning hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for diffusion language models rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards that can reinforce flawed reasoning paths leading to coincidentally correct answers, creating a mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework formalizing complex problem solving as hierarchical selection, then introduces SAPO - a RL algorithm that uses process-based reward functions to guide the dLLM's denoising process to follow structured, incremental reasoning steps.

Result: Empirical results show significant performance improvements on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhanced interpretability of the generation process compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The principled approach of aligning diffusion model denoising with latent reasoning hierarchies through process-based rewards effectively addresses unstructured refinement and improves complex reasoning capabilities in diffusion language models.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink is a safety alignment method that teaches LLMs to reason through potential failure modes before generating responses, achieving significant safety improvements while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods directly optimize for safe responses but may compromise general reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to develop a method that improves safety while mitigating this 'safety tax'.

Method: Instructs models to: 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Implemented via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning across three LLM families.

Result: Achieves up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods, shows stronger scaling with model size, preserves general reasoning capabilities, and excels in high-stakes domains including medicine, finance, law, and agentic risk scenarios.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models by systematically considering failure modes before response generation.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL is a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents through adversarial training, eliminating the need for external guard modules while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for LLM-based multi-agent systems either use underperforming self-verification that can't detect cross-agent unsafe chains, or external guard modules that create single-point-of-failure risks and increase system overhead.

Method: Joint optimization of attackers (synthesizing evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to accomplish duties while resisting attacks) in adversarial learning environments, with a public baseline for advantage estimation using group-level mean-return baselines.

Result: Consistently keeps attack-success rate below 20% (vs. 38.33% for baselines) while preserving and sometimes improving task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).

Conclusion: Safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead through internalized safety mechanisms.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

TL;DR: AgentRec is an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that improves conversational recommender systems through hierarchical agent networks, adaptive weighting, and three-tier learning strategy, achieving better conversation success, recommendation accuracy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems struggle with dynamic user preferences, conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously.

Method: Uses specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking with adaptive weighting mechanism and three-tier learning strategy (rapid response, intelligent reasoning, deep collaboration).

Result: Achieves 2.8% improvement in conversation success rate, 1.9% enhancement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: AgentRec demonstrates that multi-agent collaborative frameworks with adaptive intelligence can effectively address key challenges in conversational recommendation systems.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

TL;DR: This paper introduces PsychoBench, a benchmark based on the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE) to evaluate whether LLMs can qualify as psychological counselors by testing their psychological knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can be effectively applied to psychological counseling by assessing whether they meet the qualification standards required for human counselors, specifically the ability to pass certification exams.

Method: Created PsychoBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising approximately 2,252 single-choice questions from U.S. national counselor examinations, covering various psychology sub-disciplines and requiring deep understanding.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieved well above the passing threshold (70% accuracy), while smaller open-source models (Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remained far below it.

Conclusion: Only frontier LLMs currently meet counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs for counseling applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMDP methods fail to generalize in high-dimensional contexts, leading to excessive computation and unstable performance.

Method: Information-theoretic summarization using LLMs to compress contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries that augment states.

Result: Outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines across discrete, continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks, improving reward, success rate, sample efficiency while reducing latency and memory usage.

Conclusion: LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and determine if they can understand road network maps for navigation tasks without external tools.

Method: Used trajectory recovery as a proxy task, introduced GLOBALTRACE dataset with 4,000+ real-world trajectories, and developed a prompting framework that enables LLMs to generate valid paths using road network context.

Result: LLMs outperformed off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, showing strong comprehension of road networks and coordinate systems, though with systematic biases across regions and transportation modes.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively reason over maps for navigation tasks and enhance navigation experiences by incorporating user preferences flexibly.

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD) - a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, or context. The paper introduces BLIND-ACT benchmark with 90 tasks to evaluate BGD patterns, finding 80.8% average BGD rates across nine frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize the fundamental risk of Blind Goal-Directedness in Computer-Use Agents, where agents pursue goals without proper consideration of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context.

Method: Developed BLIND-ACT benchmark with 90 tasks capturing three BGD patterns: lack of contextual reasoning, assumptions under ambiguity, and contradictory goals. Built on OSWorld with realistic environments and used LLM-based judges (93.75% human agreement) to evaluate nine frontier models.

Result: High average BGD rates (80.8%) across all tested models including Claude Sonnet, Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5. Prompting-based interventions reduced BGD but substantial risk persisted. Identified failure modes: execution-first bias, thought-action disconnect, and request-primacy.

Conclusion: BGD exposes subtle risks in CUAs even with non-harmful inputs. Current interventions are insufficient, highlighting need for stronger training- or inference-time solutions. BLIND-ACT provides foundation for future research on mitigating this fundamental risk for safe CUA deployment.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA is a safety-first clinical system that uses high-precision classification to route patient queries to verbatim FAQ answers, eliminating generative AI risks while achieving near-GPT-4o performance with 170x lower energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of providing personalized pre-procedural counseling to patients while overcoming time constraints, privacy limitations, and risks associated with generative AI in clinical settings.

Method: Uses a local-first architecture with sentence-transformer classifiers to route inputs and return verbatim answers from clinician-curated FAQs, eliminating free-text generation in the clinical path. Evaluated on tooth extraction and gastroscopy domains with expert-reviewed validation and test sets.

Result: E5-large-instruct achieved 0.983 accuracy (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996 with only 7 errors, statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o. Non-generative clinical path consumes ~1.0 mWh per input vs ~168 mWh for small-talk replies (170x difference) with ~0.10s latency on single on-prem GPU.

Conclusion: The approach structurally avoids generation-induced errors by returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments while maintaining near-frontier discrimination performance.

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: Current AGI evaluation methods are inadequate because they rely on synthetic tasks designed from human intuitions about intelligence, which have historically performed poorly in AI development.

Method: The paper proposes shifting from synthetic task-based evaluation to a philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution and deployment competence, drawing from data science practices for reliable system deployment.

Result: The authors develop practical examples of what this alternative AGI evaluation approach would entail, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: AGI evaluation should move away from synthetic tasks based on intuitions and instead focus on demonstrating competence through robust task execution and deployment readiness.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: VaPR introduces a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided editing to create rejected responses with targeted errors while maintaining stylistic/length similarity to accepted responses. This addresses noise in synthetic preference annotations and improves LVLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference finetuning methods overlook noise in synthetic preference annotations, particularly stylistic and length biases that can mislead model training.

Method: Developed a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided response editing to create rejected responses with targeted errors while maintaining stylistic and length similarity to accepted responses. Created VaPR dataset with 30K high-quality samples for finetuning LVLMs.

Result: VaPR models achieved significant performance improvements: 6.5% average gain for LLaVA, 4.0% for Qwen2VL, and 1.5% for Qwen2.5VL across ten benchmarks. Notable improvements on reasoning tasks, reduced 'Yes' bias in binary questions, and scaling analysis showed consistent improvement with data size.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses noise in synthetic preference data and generalizes well, with open-source LLM editors achieving ~99% performance of GPT-4o-based versions. The approach improves LVLM alignment and reduces common failure modes.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaboT is an AI system that uses large language models and a multi-agent architecture to translate natural language questions into SPARQL queries for metabolomics knowledge graphs, achieving 83.67% accuracy compared to 8.16% for standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast data requiring advanced interpretation methods. Knowledge graphs structure this data but require deep understanding of ontology and query language syntax, creating technical barriers for researchers.

Method: Multi-agent system using LLMs with specialized agents for query validation, chemical conversion, knowledge graph interaction, and SPARQL query generation. Built with LangChain/LangGraph libraries on the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG).

Result: Achieved 83.67% accuracy on curated metabolomics questions, significantly outperforming baseline GPT-4o (8.16%). Successfully bridges gap between complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Conclusion: MetaboT effectively automates SPARQL query generation from natural language, removing technical barriers to knowledge graph access while maintaining domain-specific standards, facilitating data-driven discoveries in metabolomics research.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

TL;DR: Proposes a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in military operations with four key dimensions: adjustable autonomy, multi-layered control, bidirectional feedback, and collaborative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in building effective and ethical human-AI teaming systems for military operations by focusing on internal dynamics rather than external perspectives, to handle multidimensional responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects.

Method: Designs a co-learning model featuring: 1) Adjustable autonomy for dynamic calibration based on mission state and uncertainty; 2) Multi-layered control for oversight and accountability; 3) Bidirectional feedback loops for communication of reasoning and adaptations; 4) Collaborative decision-making with confidence levels and rationale.

Result: The model provides concrete exemplifications and recommendations for developing responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed four-dimensional co-learning model enables continuous bidirectional exchange between human and AI agents, supporting their joint adaptation to evolving battlefield conditions while ensuring responsibility and trustworthiness.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PTA-GRPO is a two-stage framework that enhances LLM reasoning by first distilling CoT into high-level guidance through SFT, then using guidance-aware RL to jointly optimize final outputs and guidance quality, achieving significant improvements across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning is constrained by autoregressive token-level generation, leading to local decision-making without global planning, which causes redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning. Existing approaches like tree-based algorithms and RL suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal reasoning trajectories.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance for supervised fine-tuning; 2) Introduce guidance-aware RL that jointly optimizes final output and high-level guidance quality to enhance reasoning effectiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments on MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC benchmarks with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B models show PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks.

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO effectively addresses LLM reasoning limitations by combining high-level planning with fine-grained CoT reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness across diverse mathematical reasoning tasks and base models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Claudio Fanconi,Nicol√°s Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reframes adversarial inverse reinforcement learning for large language model reasoning, learning token-level rewards from expert demonstrations to provide step-level feedback during training and inference-time reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that prioritizes correctness over surface form in reasoning tasks, enabling interpretable error localization and improved multi-step reasoning in language models.

Method: Operationalizes adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to learn dense, token-level reward models from expert demonstrations, using these rewards for step-level feedback during training and as critics for reranking sampled traces during inference.

Result: On GSM8K with Llama3 and Qwen2.5 backbones, the approach demonstrates that dense reasoning rewards can elicit reasoning and improve predictive performance through reward-guided reranking, particularly for Llama-based policies.

Conclusion: The work suggests that reusable process-level rewards have broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in language models by unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level diagnostics into a single reasoning reward.

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

### [116] [Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01902)
*Pawe≈Ç Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARS is a constrained generation method that improves rejection sampling efficiency by adaptively pruning invalid prefixes, maintaining distributional fidelity while increasing sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained generation methods either distort LM distributions (greedy decoding) or waste computation (rejection sampling), which is problematic for domains requiring both validity and diversity like program fuzzing.

Method: CARS uses unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws, ensuring invalid prefixes are never revisited.

Result: CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency (fewer LM forward passes per valid sample) and produces stronger sample diversity than both greedy constrained decoding and distribution-approximating methods across domains like program fuzzing and molecular generation.

Conclusion: CARS strictly improves rejection sampling efficiency without distributional distortion, making it suitable for applications requiring both validity and diversity in constrained generation.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: LLMs show varying alignment with human collective decision-making in social reasoning tasks, with some mirroring human biases while others attempt to compensate for them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how large language models align with human social reasoning in collective decision-making contexts, moving beyond individual-level analysis.

Method: Conducted large-scale online experiment (N=748) using Lost at Sea task, randomly assigning groups to leader elections with visible demographic attributes vs pseudonymous aliases, then simulating matched LLM groups conditioned on human data.

Result: LLM behaviors diverged - some mirrored human biases while others masked biases and attempted to compensate for them. Human-AI alignment in collective reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.

Conclusion: Understanding LLM alignment with collective human behavior is critical for socially-aligned AI, requiring dynamic benchmarks that capture the complexities of collective reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: A deterministic simulation framework provides stable, evidence-based standards for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports, addressing the dual crisis of unmanageable submission volumes and unregulated AI in scholarly publishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces unmanageable submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. Traditional human-only peer review lacks scalable, objective benchmarks.

Method: Developed a deterministic simulation framework that analyzes peer-review simulation reports to identify consistent system state indicators. Analyzed 352 peer-review simulation reports across disciplines.

Result: The system demonstrates calibrated editorial judgment with 'Revise' decisions forming majority outcomes (>50%) across disciplines, and 'Reject' rates adapting to field-specific norms (up to 45% in Health Sciences). It maintains 29% evidence-anchoring compliance rate invariant across domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a transparent tool for ensuring fairness in scientific publishing and offers scalable instruments for auditing workflows, managing integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance, repositioning AI as essential for institutional accountability.

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly

*Sanghyu Yoon,Dongmin Kim,Suhee Yoon,Ye Seul Sim,Seungdong Yoa,Hye-Seung Cho,Soonyoung Lee,Hankook Lee,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD introduces a benchmark for tabular anomaly detection that incorporates textual semantics and domain context, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that lack semantic metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular AD benchmarks provide only raw data without semantic context, ignoring textual metadata like feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts use in practice, which limits research flexibility and model performance.

Method: Created 20 curated tabular datasets with structured textual metadata, implemented state-of-the-art AD algorithms (classical, deep learning, LLM-based), and developed a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training.

Result: Semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning, establishing ReTabAD as a benchmark for context-aware AD research.

Conclusion: ReTabAD enables systematic exploration of context-aware tabular anomaly detection, demonstrating that textual semantics are crucial for improving detection performance and interpretability in domain-specific contexts.

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep layers in LLMs are often removable without major performance loss under likelihood metrics, but generation tasks reveal their critical role in reasoning and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically examine depth utilization in LLMs across diverse evaluation settings, challenging narrow claims about layer importance.

Method: Comprehensive analysis across evaluation protocols (likelihood vs. generation), task categories, and model architectures, including layer pruning experiments and distillation studies.

Result: Shallow layers handle knowledge and retrieval, while deeper layers are essential for reasoning accuracy and long-range coherence in generation tasks. Depth utilization varies significantly by evaluation metric and task type.

Conclusion: Depth usage in LLMs is heterogeneous and context-dependent, requiring task-, metric-, and model-aware approaches for proper interpretation and compression.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: While some AI models achieve human-level accuracy on abstract reasoning benchmarks like ConceptARC, their underlying reasoning often relies on surface-level shortcuts rather than genuine abstraction. Visual modality performance drops significantly, but rule analysis reveals models may be underestimated as they can identify correct abstractions but struggle to apply them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art AI models genuinely understand and reason with the intended abstractions in ConceptARC tasks, rather than just achieving high accuracy through surface-level pattern matching.

Method: Evaluated models on ConceptARC under varying conditions: input modality (text vs visual), use of external Python tools, and reasoning effort. Used dual evaluation measuring both output accuracy and fine-grained analysis of natural-language rules generated to explain solutions.

Result: Text-based models match human accuracy but their rules often use surface-level shortcuts and capture intended abstractions far less than humans. Visual modality models show sharp accuracy drop but still exhibit substantial share of rules capturing intended abstractions, though they struggle to apply them correctly.

Conclusion: Accuracy alone overestimates abstract reasoning in text modalities and underestimates it in visual modalities. Models still lag humans in genuine abstract reasoning, and the proposed evaluation framework provides more faithful assessment of multimodal abstract reasoning abilities.

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing document understanding models requires large, diverse datasets, but collecting real data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy constraints, legal restrictions, and high annotation costs that can reach millions of dollars.

Method: FlexDoc combines Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to probabilistically model layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability, enabling controlled generation of diverse document variants at scale.

Conclusion: FlexDoc is actively deployed and has accelerated development of enterprise-grade document understanding models while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework specifically designed for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) to address limitations in existing benchmarks for assessing AI agent systems capable of complex research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their ability to effectively assess interconnected agent systems like DRAs that perform task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, and multi-stage reasoning.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark with 214 expert-curated challenging queries across 10 domains, accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles, and created a multidimensional evaluation framework with integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness.

Result: Experiments showed that mainstream DRAs outperform web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, but there is still considerable room for improvement in their capabilities.

Conclusion: This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems, addressing the shift from closed language models to interconnected agent systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

*Yuhao Sun,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Kun Yang,Lingyun Yu,Yongdong Zhang,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UpSafe¬∞C is a unified framework that enhances LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling, converting safety-critical layers into sparse Mixture-of-Experts structures with safety experts, enabling dynamic inference-time control via safety temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to safety risks like harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks, while existing safety techniques face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability.

Method: Identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into sparse MoE structure with router as soft guardrail; uses two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities; introduces safety temperature for dynamic inference-time control.

Result: Achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks; safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control achieving Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety.

Conclusion: Highlights a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) for LLMs shrinks reasoning boundaries due to negative interference and winner-take-all dynamics, but a data curation algorithm focusing on low-likelihood problems improves Pass@k performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why RLVR, despite being designed to improve LLM reasoning, paradoxically shrinks reasoning boundaries and understand the underlying learning dynamics causing this failure.

Method: Analyzed RLVR learning dynamics through theoretical and empirical analysis on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, identifying negative interference and winner-take-all phenomena, then proposed a data curation algorithm that focuses learning on low-likelihood problems.

Result: Revealed that RLVR causes negative interference (learning some problems reduces performance on others) and winner-take-all dynamics (reinforcing high-likelihood solutions while suppressing low-likelihood ones), leading to Pass@k performance decline. The proposed data curation algorithm achieved notable improvements in Pass@k performance.

Conclusion: RLVR's shrinkage issue stems from on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing convergence to narrow solution strategies. Focusing learning on low-likelihood problems through data curation effectively mitigates this problem and improves reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

### [126] [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Agents for Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02250)
*Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Vincent Tu,Chih-Lun Lee,Jiachen Yang,Ang Li,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) is a scaling method for computer-use agents that generates multiple rollouts and selects the best using behavior narratives, achieving 69.9% success rate on OSWorld and approaching human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents (CUAs) are unreliable and have high variance, which hinders their application to long-horizon, complex digital tasks.

Method: Generate multiple agent rollouts and select among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts, enabling both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection.

Result: Established new state-of-the-art at 69.9% on OSWorld, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%. Demonstrated strong generalization to WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: Effective scaling of CUAs requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this, highlighting the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling when done properly.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

### [127] [RLAD: Training LLMs to Discover Abstractions for Solving Reasoning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02263)
*Yuxiao Qu,Anikait Singh,Yoonho Lee,Amrith Setlur,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Chelsea Finn,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces reasoning abstractions - concise natural language descriptions of procedural knowledge - and RLAD, a two-player RL training paradigm that jointly trains an abstraction generator and solution generator to improve algorithmic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning traces in large models often drift into verbose exploration instead of consistently capturing and reusing procedures. The goal is to enable more effective algorithmic reasoning beyond pattern matching.

Method: Proposed RLAD: a two-player RL training paradigm where one model generates reasoning abstractions (concise procedural descriptions) and another builds solutions using these abstractions. This decouples abstraction proposal from solution generation.

Result: The approach enables structured exploration, improves generalization to harder problems, and shows that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial than generating more solutions.

Conclusion: Reasoning abstractions and the RLAD framework effectively guide meaningful exploration and improve algorithmic reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

### [128] [BioX-Bridge: Model Bridging for Unsupervised Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer across Biosignals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02276)
*Chenqi Li,Yu Liu,Timothy Denison,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioX-Bridge is a framework for unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals that uses a lightweight bridge network to align intermediate representations between foundation models, reducing trainable parameters by 88-99% while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biosignals are intercorrelated but limited labeled datasets make model training challenging. Existing knowledge distillation methods are computationally expensive, especially with large foundation models.

Method: Train a lightweight bridge network to align intermediate representations between foundation models across modalities, with an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions and a flexible prototype network as bridge architecture.

Result: BioX-Bridge reduces trainable parameters by 88-99% while maintaining or improving transfer performance across multiple biosignal modalities, tasks, and datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient cross-modal knowledge transfer for biosignals, addressing computational challenges while leveraging the benefits of foundation models.

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A fully onboard UAV system for GNSS-denied long-range navigation using LiDAR heightmap matching and particle filtering to reduce odometry drift, successfully deployed in a 9km competition flight across varied terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable long-range UAV flight in GNSS-denied environments where odometry drift accumulates, loop closures are unavailable in new areas, and computational resources are limited on embedded platforms.

Method: Integrates perception, mapping, planning, and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to prior geo-data heightmaps via gradient-template matching, fused with odometry in a clustered particle filter.

Result: Successfully executed kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain during competition, substantially reducing drift relative to raw odometry while running in real-time on CPU-only hardware.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates practical GNSS-denied UAV autonomy with field deployment insights that inform future designs, showing effective drift reduction through heightmap matching and particle filtering.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

TL;DR: Safe motion planning for autonomous vessels using MPC with adaptive CBFs and time-varying inflated ellipse obstacles to navigate narrow waterways in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional motion planning for autonomous vessels is either computationally intensive or overly conservative, especially in narrow inland waterways where safety is critical.

Method: Combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) using time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where inflation radius adapts based on relative position and attitude between vessel and obstacle.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show the strategy enables fully-actuated autonomous robot vessels to navigate narrow spaces in real-time, resolve deadlocks, and ensure safety with reduced conservatism.

Conclusion: The proposed MPC-CBF approach with adaptive obstacle inflation provides an effective real-time safe motion planning solution for autonomous vessels in challenging narrow waterways.

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots using factor-graph optimization with continuous-time kinematics corrupted by Gaussian process noise, enabling adaptability to unmodelled forces and data dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state estimation techniques for continuum robots use computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations, or quasi-static methods that are sensitive to unmodelled disturbances.

Method: Uses factor-graph optimization paradigm with continuous-time kinematics factors corrupted by white noise Gaussian process, pairing simple robot model with high-rate sensing.

Result: Produces estimates of mean and covariance for robot's pose, velocity, and strain that can be continuously interpolated in time or space, with linear solve complexity and constant-time interpolation queries.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates versatility in real-world systems with gyroscope and pose sensors, showing adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VENTURA is a vision-language navigation system that fine-tunes image diffusion models to generate visual path masks for robot navigation, achieving significant improvements in success rates and collision reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in unstructured environments. While Vision-Language models provide strong language and perception grounding, they struggle with transferability to robotics tasks due to action space differences and pretraining objectives.

Method: VENTURA fine-tunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning, generating visual path masks in image space instead of predicting low-level actions. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy then grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories. Training uses path masks from self-supervised tracking models with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual annotation.

Result: VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios in object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks. It also demonstrates emergent compositional capabilities by generalizing to unseen task combinations.

Conclusion: VENTURA provides an effective approach for vision-language navigation by generating visual plans that capture fine-grained, context-aware behaviors, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and operate safely in open-world environments.

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a framework that uses token-level uncertainty signals to predict when Vision-Language-Action models should request human help, achieving reliable failure anticipation through transformer-based temporal modeling of uncertainty dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures and requesting human supervision, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Extract per-token uncertainty signals (entropy, log-probability, aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty) from œÄ‚ÇÄ-FAST models and train compact transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers, comparing strong vs weak supervision regimes.

Result: Strong supervision enables fine-grained uncertainty dynamics capture for reliable help detection, while weak supervision remains competitive when training/evaluation are aligned. Temporal modeling of token-level uncertainty provides significantly greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic evaluation of uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, enabling future active learning and real-time error mitigation through selective human intervention.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

TL;DR: Proposes Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) that uses adaptive parabolic boundaries based on distance and relative velocity to improve safety and feasibility for nonholonomic robots in dense dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBF methods for nonholonomic robots are too conservative and often infeasible in dense dynamic environments due to reliance on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints that only consider relative velocity angle.

Method: Develops DPCBF with dynamically adapting parabolic boundaries where vertex and curvature adjust based on obstacle distance and relative velocity magnitude, creating less restrictive safety constraints for kinematic bicycle models with input constraints.

Result: DPCBF significantly improves navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to baseline methods, successfully navigating through environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles where collision-cone methods fail.

Conclusion: The proposed DPCBF approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional CBF methods in dense dynamic environments by providing adaptive, less conservative safety constraints that maintain feasibility while ensuring safety.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

### [135] [How Well do Diffusion Policies Learn Kinematic Constraint Manifolds?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01404)
*Lexi Foland,Thomas Cohn,Adam Wei,Nicholas Pfaff,Boyuan Chen,Russ Tedrake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Diffusion policies can learn kinematic constraints in robot imitation learning but only approximate them coarsely. Dataset size and quality significantly impact learning, while manifold curvature shows inconclusive effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well diffusion policies learn kinematic constraint manifolds in robot tasks, since task performance alone doesn't reliably indicate constraint learning precision.

Method: Case study on bimanual pick-and-place task requiring kinematic constraint satisfaction. Analyzed effects of dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature on trained diffusion policies.

Result: Diffusion policies learn coarse approximations of constraint manifolds. Learning is negatively affected by reduced dataset size and quality. Manifold curvature showed inconclusive correlations with constraint satisfaction and task success.

Conclusion: Diffusion policies can approximate kinematic constraints but learning is sensitive to dataset characteristics. Real-world hardware evaluation confirms applicability of findings.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT is a lightweight vision-based robot learning framework that uses affordance-guided semantic 2D keypoints from text prompts and single images, achieving efficient real-time manipulation without dense representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational heaviness and irrelevant background features in dense vision inputs, and overcome limitations of manual heuristic or task-coupled keypoint selection in existing approaches.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering, category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning with embedded gating to select relevant keypoints.

Result: Achieves 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel categories, backgrounds, and distractors; trains in 15 minutes with compact 38-dimensional state policy; performs well in real-time without proprioception.

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT significantly improves data efficiency and scalability for vision-based robot manipulation across diverse real-world tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cooperative robotic guidance system with haptic feedback improves tumor localization and resection margins in simulated breast-conserving surgery, reducing mental demand and effort for surgeons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tumor boundaries are challenging to delineate during breast-conserving surgery due to tumor mobility, non-palpability, and irregular shapes, requiring improved localization methods.

Method: A haptic robot with electrocautery blade uses ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation to identify tumor boundaries, imposing forbidden region virtual fixtures when the tool approaches tumor boundaries. Study compared resections with and without haptic guidance in breast simulants.

Result: Virtual fixture guidance improved resection margins and reduced mental demand, frustration, and effort for users. Unanticipated workflow impacts were identified for future design improvements.

Conclusion: Virtual fixtures can help localize tumor boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery, with future work planned for extensive user studies and system refinement.

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Conclusion: VL-KnG demonstrates practical applicability for robot navigation tasks with explainable reasoning, computational efficiency, and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while addressing fundamental limitations of current VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system

manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5
Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the
knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across
different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Pose estimation for a bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints and minimal sensing using Kalman filter with Gaussian process residual learning, showing comparable performance between multi-gait and single-gait trained filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of pose estimation for underactuated, minimally sensed bioinspired robots with complex dynamics and non-Gaussian noise.

Method: Used unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise, tested through hardware experiments and offline analysis.

Result: Successfully demonstrated reliable pose estimation, and showed that filters trained on multi-gait datasets perform comparably to those trained on larger single-gait datasets when tested on forward-gait trajectories.

Conclusion: There is overlap in gait input space that can be exploited to reduce training data requirements while improving filter generalizability across multiple gaits.

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical planning framework that combines sparse global graphs with neural field-based local planners to overcome spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting in robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation methods struggle with resolution control, scalability, and data requirements. Neural field approaches suffer from spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting in complex environments.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition: high-level sparse graph captures global connectivity, low-level neural field planner solves Eikonal PDE for local obstacle navigation using physics-informed strategy.

Result: Validated in large-scale environments, showing enhanced adaptability and precision compared to previous methods, with smooth cost landscape representation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation by overcoming key limitations of existing neural field approaches.

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

TL;DR: Real-time multi-plane segmentation method using GPU-accelerated 3D voxel mapping for legged robots, achieving 30+ Hz updates at 0.01m resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs: depth image segmentation has poor temporal integration, height maps can't represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based methods aren't real-time capable.

Method: Integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with RANSAC plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to extract planar regions from point clouds in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.

Result: Achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at 0.01m resolution, enabling real-time use for locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Validated effectiveness through simulated and physical legged robot experiments, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

TL;DR: MiniBEE is a compact bimanual end-effector system that uses two reduced-mobility arms coupled into a kinematic chain, enabling full relative positioning between grippers while being lightweight and wearable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bimanual manipulators use two full 6-7 DOF arms, which increases system complexity while only using a fraction of the workspace for dexterous interaction.

Method: Developed MiniBEE with two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF each) coupled into a kinematic chain, formulated a kinematic dexterity metric for design optimization, and supports two modes: wearable kinesthetic data collection and deployment on standard robot arms.

Result: The system enables wearable demonstrations that train imitation learning policies for robust, real-world bimanual manipulation while extending dexterity across the entire workspace.

Conclusion: MiniBEE provides a compact, lightweight alternative to traditional bimanual manipulators that maintains full relative gripper positioning and enables effective bimanual manipulation through wearable demonstration and imitation learning.

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Motivation: To develop a scalable data collection system that can transfer complex bimanual manipulation skills from human demonstrations to robots, with emphasis on capturing the crucial link between visual attention and manipulation.

Method: Couples portable VR teleoperation with sensorized controllers that mirror robot end-effectors, using precise pose alignment, immersive 3D rendering, wearable computers, and efficient calibration. Key innovation is capturing active egocentric perception through head-mounted display tracking.

Result: Achieved 70% average success rate on in-distribution bimanual tasks and 56% success rate on novel objects and environments, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Portable data collection systems combined with learned active perception provide an effective and scalable pathway for creating generalizable, capable real-world robot policies.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual
manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized
controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot
kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a
self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods.
ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs still encounter failures during execution, and existing datasets provide only ground-truth trajectories without recovery capabilities. Few failure detection datasets offer only textual explanations that are hard to use in VLA models.

Method: FailSafe automatically produces diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions, applicable to any manipulation task in any simulator. The system fine-tunes LLaVa-OneVision-7B to build FailSafe-VLM for failure detection and recovery.

Result: FailSafe-VLM improves three state-of-the-art VLA models (pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across tasks in Maniskill. It also generalizes across different spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments.

Conclusion: FailSafe provides a scalable solution for creating failure-action data and enables robots to reason about and recover from failures, significantly enhancing VLA model robustness in robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

TL;DR: A statistical framework for robust visual-inertial odometry that learns measurement reliability online using multi-view geometric consistency as self-supervision, achieving significant improvements in tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VIO methods assume static, uniform uncertainty for all measurements, which fails to capture dynamic error characteristics in real-world data, limiting robustness and accuracy.

Method: Leverages multi-view geometric consistency as self-supervision to learn measurement reliability assessment online from sensor data and optimization results, enabling adaptive weighting of visual measurements.

Result: On the EuRoC dataset, achieved average reductions of 24% in translation error and 42% in rotation error compared to baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters, while operating in real-time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates enhanced accuracy and robustness in VIO by dynamically assessing measurement reliability, with source code to be made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SymSkill combines imitation learning and task-and-motion planning to enable compositional generalization and real-time failure recovery in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: imitation learning lacks compositional generalization while task-and-motion planning has prohibitive planning latency, preventing real-time failure recovery.

Method: SymSkill learns predicates, operators, and skills from unlabeled demonstrations offline, then uses symbolic planning to compose skills at execution time with real-time recovery at both motion and symbolic levels.

Result: Achieved 85% success rate on 12 single-step tasks in simulation, composed skills into multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions, and demonstrated real-world performance on a Franka robot using only 5 minutes of unlabeled play data.

Conclusion: SymSkill successfully bridges the gap between imitation learning and task-and-motion planning, enabling robust compositional manipulation with real-time failure recovery.

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A geometric backstepping controller for variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotors that explicitly accounts for nonlinear servo and rotor dynamics, showing improved stability and tracking performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior actuator-aware control approaches for multirotors rely on linear input-wrench relationships, which cannot capture the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles, limiting effectiveness during aggressive maneuvers or disturbance recovery.

Method: Exploits the cascade structure between rigid-body dynamics and nonlinear actuator dynamics to design a geometric backstepping controller, establishing exponential stability and demonstrating robustness against parametric uncertainty in actuator models.

Result: The proposed controller outperformed baseline methods in three experimental scenarios (fast translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, disturbance recovery), maintaining stability where the baseline diverged and crashed, while achieving better tracking performance.

Conclusion: The geometric backstepping controller successfully accounts for nonlinear actuator dynamics in variable-tilt multirotors, providing superior stability and tracking performance, especially during aggressive maneuvers and disturbance recovery scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PolySim introduces a multi-simulator training platform for humanoid whole-body control that reduces sim-to-real gap by training policies across multiple heterogeneous simulators simultaneously, enabling better generalization and zero-shot real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid WBC policies trained in simulation suffer from simulator inductive bias - inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator that cause discrepancies across simulators and between simulation and real world.

Method: PolySim integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators to launch parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single training run, achieving dynamics-level domain randomization.

Result: PolySim substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations, improving execution success by 52.8% on MuJoCo over IsaacSim baseline, and enables zero-shot deployment on real Unitree G1 without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Training policies jointly across multiple simulators mitigates simulator inductive bias, provides tighter theoretical bounds on bias, and enables effective sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

*Taeyoung Kim,Jimin Lee,Myungkyu Koo,Dongyoung Kim,Kyungmin Lee,Changyeon Kim,Younggyo Seo,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RS-CL is a lightweight representation regularization method that improves VLA models for robot manipulation by aligning representations with robot proprioceptive states using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack sensitivity to robotic signals like control actions and proprioceptive states, making their representations suboptimal for robot manipulation tasks.

Method: Introduces Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL) that uses relative distances between robot proprioceptive states as soft supervision to align VLM representations with robotic signals.

Result: Improves pick-and-place task performance from 30.8% to 41.5% on RoboCasa-Kitchen and boosts real-robot manipulation success rates from 45.0% to 58.3%.

Conclusion: RS-CL effectively bridges the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals, enhancing control-relevant representation learning while being compatible with standard VLA training pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: A magnetic continuum robot with radially embedded permanent magnets enables independent bending or torsion control using a single external magnet, featuring a dual-layer blockage mechanism for on-demand drug release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the deformation capabilities of magnetic continuum robots beyond bending-only motion, enabling more versatile navigation and precise payload delivery in minimally invasive procedures.

Method: Embedding permanent magnets radially within the catheter wall, using physics-based formulation with finite-element analysis, and implementing a dual-layer blockage mechanism with outer grooves and inner plates for torsional shear-activated drug release.

Result: The system achieved decoupled bending and torsion control under practical magnetic fields, validated through benchtop experiments and demonstrated end-to-end operation in phantom interventions with successful target approach and twist-activated drug release.

Conclusion: The compact, cable-free platform combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, showing strong potential for next-generation site-specific therapies in minimally invasive interventions.

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

TL;DR: TS-ACES is a scalable solver for the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem that can handle factories with hundreds of machines, addressing the limitations of current solvers that only scale to dozens of machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern smart factories contain hundreds of machines, but existing SFE solvers can only handle factories with a couple dozen machines, creating a significant scalability gap.

Method: TS-ACES (Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver) is introduced as a complete and scalable solution that uses a traffic system-based approach for embedding manufacturing processes.

Result: TS-ACES can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with more than a hundred machines, demonstrating significant scalability improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TS-ACES provides the first highly scalable solution to the SFE problem, enabling the embedding of manufacturing procedures in modern smart factories with hundreds of machines.

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

TL;DR: Nav-EE is a navigation-guided early-exit framework that reduces Vision-Language Model inference latency in autonomous driving by precomputing task-specific exit layers and dynamically applying them based on navigation context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face high inference latency in autonomous driving applications, and traditional early-exit methods lack generalization across diverse scenarios. The authors observe that navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts, indicating which tasks will be required.

Method: Proposed Nav-EE framework precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. The system leverages navigation foresight to determine optimal exit points for different driving scenarios.

Result: Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH datasets show Nav-EE achieves comparable accuracy to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe demonstrated reduced inference latency from 600ms to 300ms.

Conclusion: Coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems, supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Large-scale empirical study of modular RL-based ObjectNav systems reveals perception quality and test-time strategies are key performance drivers, while policy improvements yield marginal gains. Enhanced system achieves new SotA with 6.6% SPL improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ObjectNav is critical for real-world robot deployment but lacks unifying analysis of which components drive performance. RL dominates but design choices vary widely without clear understanding of their impact.

Method: Decomposed modular RL-based ObjectNav systems into three components: perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Conducted extensive controlled experiments to isolate each component's contribution.

Result: Perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive performance drivers, while policy improvements with current methods yield only marginal gains. Enhanced system surpasses SotA by 6.6% SPL and 2.7% success rate. Human experts achieve 98% success under identical conditions.

Conclusion: Study provides principled design guidelines for ObjectNav development, highlighting the gap between RL agents and human-level navigation while setting new SotA performance benchmarks.

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

*Wanyue Li,Ji Ma,Minghao Lu,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a spatial-temporal trajectory planning method for bipedal robots to perform soccer kicking motions, addressing limitations in current MPC approaches by optimizing foot trajectories with target position, velocity, and acceleration constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robot soccer requires stable kicking motions with precise ball control. Current methods (position-based control, RL, and oversimplified MPC) fail to adequately handle leg swing dynamics, limiting environmental interaction capabilities for tasks like ball kicking.

Method: The study adapts spatial-temporal trajectory planning from drone applications to bipedal systems, autonomously generating foot trajectories that satisfy kicking constraints while optimizing swing phase duration.

Result: The optimized trajectories mimic human kicking behavior with backswing motion. The algorithm achieves planning times under 1 ms and nearly 100% task completion accuracy for soccer goals within ¬±90¬∞ range.

Conclusion: The proposed spatial-temporal trajectory planning method effectively addresses bipedal robot kicking challenges, demonstrating high efficiency and reliability for soccer applications while maintaining human-like motion characteristics.

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single pilots managing multi-drone systems need flexible autonomy levels from direct control to fully autonomous swarm behaviors, requiring a framework that supports multiple shared autonomy modes while reducing workload through intuitive language interfaces.

Method: TACOS integrates three key capabilities: one-to-many natural language interface, intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real world. It uses LLMs to interact with executable APIs for semantic reasoning and real-time multi-robot coordination.

Result: The system was demonstrated in real-world multi-drone systems and an ablation study was conducted to assess the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: TACOS provides a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through LLMs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Motivation: To create a portable platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion, enabling programmable impedance control in sagittal-plane motion for quadruped robots.

Method: Developed a compact spine module with three torque-controlled actuators, custom 1 kHz control board, and RNEA-based computed-acceleration controller with Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper behavior without explicit inertia shaping.

Result: Bench experiments validated linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness of 300-700 N/m (‚â§1.5% relative error, R¬≤‚â•0.992), and dynamic tests confirmed mass-spring-damper responses across multiple damping settings with small phase deviations.

Conclusion: SPARC successfully provides a portable platform for spine compliance studies in legged locomotion and will be released with complete hardware and firmware resources, outperforming traditional task-space PD controllers in linearity and coupling sensitivity.

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

*Varun Kotian,Vishrut Jain,Andrea Michelle Rios Lazcano,Daan Marinus Pool,Riender Happee,Barys Shyrokau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A motion cueing algorithm using model predictive control reduces motion sickness in driving simulators by 50% while maintaining fidelity, by jointly optimizing for both sensory conflict minimization and specific force tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driving simulators cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled visuals, limiting their research and development use. Current approaches don't adequately address the trade-off between motion fidelity and user comfort.

Method: Proposed a motion cueing algorithm using model predictive control that penalizes both sensory conflict (predicted by subjective vertical conflict model) and specific force errors. Compared four simulator settings: two MPC variations (pure force tracking vs. compromise), adaptive washout, and no motion.

Result: The compromise MPC solution reduced motion sickness by over 50% (average MISC level from 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and pure force tracking, without significant fidelity reduction. No motion had lowest sickness but poorest fidelity ratings.

Conclusion: The MPC-based approach that considers both simulator dynamics and motion sickness evolution offers significant advancement in achieving optimal control of motion sickness and force recreation, supporting broader simulator adoption.

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

Method: The framework couples a tracking module with sparse feature point maps and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. It incorporates both local and global loop closures for multi-view consistency.

Result: Experiments show EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while being faster and more memory-efficient. It runs effectively on resource-constrained platforms like laptops and Jetson Orin NX.

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM demonstrates strong potential for real-world robotics applications by providing an efficient, calibration-free solution that maintains high accuracy while operating on limited computational resources.

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-driven grasping methods struggle with ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents, limiting robots' ability to understand unstated task requirements in unstructured environments.

Method: Integrates fine-tuned LLMs for commonsense understanding and environmental perception to deduce implicit intents, and uses a point cloud localization module guided by 2D part segmentation for partial point cloud localization.

Result: Accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifies critical unstated operations and target information, and enables high-precision grasping from object-level to part-level manipulation.

Conclusion: LangGrasp significantly enhances robot adaptability and task execution efficiency in unstructured environments by handling implicit intents and enabling fine-grained manipulation.

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

TL;DR: The paper presents improved stand-up motions for the NAO robot in soccer, focusing on addressing joint position errors to increase success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stand-up motions are crucial for humanoid robot soccer as robots unable to stand up are removed from games. The need for reliable stand-up routines motivated this research.

Method: The approach addresses large joint position errors by executing special motions to free stuck limbs (like arms) and compensating errors with other joints. The method has been developed and refined over six years since 2019.

Result: The stand-up routine significantly increased overall success rates. The motions are used by multiple teams in the Standard Platform League and achieve similar success rates across tournaments.

Conclusion: Addressing joint position errors through specialized motions and error compensation is an effective strategy for improving stand-up success rates in humanoid robot soccer.

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Conclusion: The SCANS system advances soft robotics by demonstrating the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory modality, with capabilities for material identification through spectroscopy in both pre-touch and in-hand scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and

*Sara Strakosova,Petr Novak,Petr Kadera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using digital twin technology with Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Networks (Bi-PAN) to optimize disassembly processes for circular economy, specifically demonstrated through electric vehicle battery recycling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturers often don't share relevant data needed for remanufacturing and recycling processes, hindering sustainability efforts in the circular economy.

Method: The paper introduces Bi-PAN representation that extends the PAN paradigm to cover both manufacturing and remanufacturing/recycling phases, using digital twin technology to model relationships across products, processes, and resources.

Result: The approach enables flexible and efficient disassembly of various electric vehicle battery types, reducing ecological impact and enhancing sustainability.

Conclusion: Digital twin technology with Bi-PAN representation can effectively solve challenges in product disassembly and support circular economy goals by optimizing end-of-life processes.

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DisCo-Layout is a novel framework for 3D indoor layout synthesis that disentangles physical and semantic refinement using specialized tools and multi-agent coordination to generate realistic and coherent layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets, while recent LLM/VLM approaches lack robust refinement capabilities, leading to suboptimal layouts.

Method: Uses disentangled refinement with Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) for abstract relationships and Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) for spatial issues via grid-matching. Employs multi-agent framework with planner, designer, and evaluator for collaborative refinement.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts.

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout effectively addresses refinement challenges in 3D layout synthesis through coordinated physical and semantic refinement, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

### [166] [Performance-Guided Refinement for Visual Aerial Navigation using Editable Gaussian Splatting in FalconGym 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02248)
*Yan Miao,Ege Yuceel,Georgios Fainekos,Bardh Hoxha,Hideki Okamoto,Sayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FalconGym 2.0 is a photorealistic simulation framework using Gaussian Splatting with an Edit API for rapid track generation. Combined with Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, it trains visual policies that outperform state-of-the-art methods in generalization and robustness, achieving successful sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art visual policies for aerial navigation often overfit to single tracks and degrade when track geometry changes, highlighting the need for better generalization capabilities.

Method: Developed FalconGym 2.0 simulation framework with Gaussian Splatting and Edit API for programmatic track generation. Proposed Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm that focuses training on challenging tracks to iteratively improve policy performance.

Result: A single visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 achieved 100% success on three unseen tracks without retraining, maintained higher success rates under gate-pose perturbations, and achieved 98.6% success rate (69/70 gates) in real-world quadrotor hardware through zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The combination of FalconGym 2.0's rapid track generation capability and PGR's focused training approach enables robust visual policies that generalize well across diverse tracks and successfully transfer from simulation to real-world aerial navigation tasks.

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

### [167] [Retargeting Matters: General Motion Retargeting for Humanoid Motion Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02252)
*Joao Pedro Araujo,Yanjie Ze,Pei Xu,Jiajun Wu,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how retargeting quality affects humanoid motion tracking policies and proposes GMR, a new retargeting method that outperforms existing open-source approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid motion tracking approaches suffer from artifacts introduced during retargeting (foot sliding, self-penetration, infeasible motion) that require extensive reward engineering to correct. The paper aims to systematically evaluate retargeting quality's impact on policy performance.

Method: Proposed General Motion Retargeting (GMR) method and compared it with PHC, ProtoMotions, and Unitree's closed-source dataset. Used BeyondMimic for policy training to isolate retargeting effects without reward tuning.

Result: GMR consistently outperformed existing open-source methods in tracking performance and faithfulness to source motion, achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the closed-source baseline. Artifacts in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness.

Conclusion: Retargeting quality matters significantly for humanoid motion tracking policies. GMR provides a superior open-source solution that reduces artifacts and improves policy robustness, particularly for dynamic or long motion sequences.

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

### [168] [Do You Know Where Your Camera Is? View-Invariant Policy Learning with Camera Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02268)
*Tianchong Jiang,Jingtian Ji,Xiangshan Tan,Jiading Fang,Anand Bhattad,Vitor Guizilini,Matthew R. Walter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper shows that explicitly conditioning policies on camera extrinsics improves view-invariant imitation learning, preventing policies from relying on background cues as shortcuts for camera pose inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of policies failing to generalize across viewpoints by relying on visual shortcuts from static backgrounds rather than learning true view-invariant representations.

Method: Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays to condition policies on camera extrinsics, evaluated on six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and ManiSkill with fixed vs randomized scene variants.

Result: Policies conditioned on extrinsics significantly outperform standard behavior cloning methods (ACT, Diffusion Policy, SmolVLA) across viewpoint shifts, enabling robust RGB-only control without depth.

Conclusion: Explicit camera extrinsics conditioning is crucial for achieving true view-invariant imitation learning and prevents policies from exploiting background cues as shortcuts.

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

### [169] [ARMADA: Autonomous Online Failure Detection and Human Shared Control Empower Scalable Real-world Deployment and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02298)
*Wenye Yu,Jun Lv,Zixi Ying,Yang Jin,Chuan Wen,Cewu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARMADA is a multi-robot system with human-in-the-loop shared control that uses FLOAT for autonomous failure detection, enabling parallel policy rollout with minimal human intervention and efficient in-domain data collection for policy adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained imitation learning policies perform poorly without sufficient in-domain data, and human-collected demonstrations are labor-intensive with mixed-quality data. Existing human-in-the-loop systems require full-time human surveillance during policy rollout.

Method: ARMADA uses FLOAT (autonomous online failure detection method) to enable paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when necessary. This reduces reliance on human supervision while collecting in-domain data for policy post-training.

Result: FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy in failure detection, surpassing prior state-of-the-art approaches by over 20%. ARMADA shows more than 4√ó increase in success rate and greater than 2√ó reduction in human intervention rate compared to previous human-in-the-loop methods.

Conclusion: ARMADA enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, leading to more scalable deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios with significantly reduced human supervision requirements.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.
