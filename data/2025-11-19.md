### [1] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla is a large-scale BEV perception dataset built in CARLA simulator that addresses the lack of standardized datasets for closed-loop autonomous driving simulation, enabling seamless transfer of real-world models and accelerating E2E development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are collected from real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning but offering limited value for closed-loop testing, which hinders the development of E2E autonomous driving systems.

Method: Created nuCarla - a nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset within CARLA simulator with full nuScenes format compatibility, comparable scale to nuScenes but with more balanced class distributions, and direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment.

Result: Provides high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results, and offers both data and models as open benchmarks for the research community.

Conclusion: nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development and paves the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving by addressing the dataset gap for interactive simulation environments.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [2] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to mitigate overconfidence in Open Set Recognition by using perturbation-based uncertainty estimation and two-stage unknown detection to better distinguish between known and unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overconfidence in Open Set Recognition where unknown samples similar to known classes get misclassified due to inter-class feature space overlap, which blurs the decision boundary.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Perturbation-based uncertainty estimation using controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify uncertainty, 2) Two-stage unknown detection with learning-based classifiers that leverage estimated uncertainty.

Result: Experimental results on three public datasets show superior performance over existing OSR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap and enhances Open Set Recognition performance.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [3] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-aware temporal modeling approach for few-shot video object detection that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames to maintain temporal consistency and improve detection accuracy with limited labeled examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video object detection methods require extensive training data and struggle with temporal consistency issues like occlusion and appearance variations. Few-shot learning addresses these limitations but faces challenges in novel object generalization without computationally expensive region proposals.

Method: Object-aware temporal modeling with filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. Uses few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, eliminating need for explicit object tube proposals.

Result: Achieved significant AP improvements: 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5% (VidVRD) in 5-shot setting. Demonstrated consistent improvements across 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses temporal consistency challenges in few-shot video object detection while achieving robust performance gains across multiple datasets and shot configurations without complex region proposal mechanisms.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [4] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FusionFM, a flow matching-based approach for multi-modal image fusion that directly transports source modalities to fused images, improving sampling efficiency and structural consistency while using pseudo-labels from existing models for supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal image fusion methods rely on task-specific models with high training costs and limited scalability, while generative methods suffer from slow inference due to complex sampling trajectories.

Method: The authors formulate image fusion as probabilistic transport using flow matching, collect fusion results from SOTA models as priors with task-aware selection, introduce a Fusion Refiner module for enhancing degraded components, and integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay for multi-task scenarios.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

Conclusion: FusionFM provides an efficient and scalable solution for multi-modal image fusion by leveraging flow matching and pseudo-label supervision, with enhanced continual learning capabilities for multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [5] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework using diffusion models to generate future road segment maps and identify crashes by comparing monitored maps with generated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking by using road segment maps with individual-level traffic dynamic data for real-time crash detection.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Mapfusion diffusion model adds noise to road segment maps then denoises using temporal embeddings and ControlNet for background context, 2) Crash detection by comparing monitored maps with generated maps.

Result: Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps from non-crash data, robust across sampling intervals, and effectively detects real-world crashes.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-free two-stage method using diffusion models is effective for accurate real-time crash detection without requiring vehicle trajectory data.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [6] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADATG, an adaptive two-grid foundation model with Hilbert encoding for seismic data that addresses the limitations of standard vision transformers in handling both high- and low-frequency seismic features through spectrum decomposition and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision transformers fail to effectively capture both high- and low-frequency features in seismic data due to their sequential tokenization approach, which ignores the intrinsic patterns and hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data.

Method: Proposes ADATG with Hilbert encoding that uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components, hierarchical Hilbert encoding for data representation, and an adaptive training strategy that progressively shifts focus from coarse to fine features based on the frequency principle.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed training methods in handling seismic data characteristics.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies tailored to the distinct characteristics of seismic data's high- and low-frequency features for enhancing visual seismic foundation models.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [7] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a language-free dementia screening method using facial micro-dynamics from short talking head videos, achieving high performance without speech or text analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dementia screening methods rely on speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinical settings and coupling predictions to language. The authors aim to enable passive, scalable screening using natural facial behaviors that are transferable across devices and cultures.

Method: The method analyzes temporal facial kinematics including blink dynamics, mouth/jaw motions, gaze variability, and head adjustments. It stabilizes facial signals, converts micro-movements into interpretable time series, smooths them, and summarizes short windows into clip-level statistics that analyze the distribution of motion across streams rather than magnitude.

Result: On the YT DemTalk dataset (300 clips: 150 dementia, 150 controls), the method achieved AUROC of 0.953, Average Precision of 0.961, F1-score of 0.851, and accuracy of 0.857. Gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics were identified as the most informative cues.

Conclusion: Facial temporal micro-dynamics are sufficient for effective dementia screening without speech or text, enabling passive, scalable analysis that can be deployed in-the-wild across different devices and cultures.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [8] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe is a new benchmark framework that evaluates video generation models' Chain-of-Frames reasoning capabilities across six cognitive dimensions, revealing gaps between visual quality and actual reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on visual fidelity but fail to assess core cognitive abilities like multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, and abstract pattern extrapolation in Chain-of-Frames reasoning, creating an evaluation void.

Method: Developed Gen-ViRe framework with six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks, using multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria for quantitative assessment.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art systems show substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe provides the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners, enabling systematic understanding of capabilities and principled guidance for advancing genuine world simulators.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [9] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ranking-based losses for human pose estimation to address issues with traditional MSE loss, heatmap imbalance, and metric-loss misalignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO and other datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key problems in heatmap-based pose estimation: (P1) MSE loss doesn't focus on peak localization, (P2) heatmap spatial and class imbalance, (P3) discrepancy between mAP evaluation metric and loss functions.

Method: Propose ranking-based losses that align with mAP evaluation metric, applied to both 1D and 2D heatmaps across multiple datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).

Result: RSPose achieves 79.9 mAP on COCO-val with ViTPose-H (new SOTA) and improves SimCC Resnet-50 by 1.5 AP to 73.6 AP. Increases correlation between confidence scores and localization quality.

Conclusion: Ranking-based losses effectively address heatmap limitations and metric-loss misalignment, achieving superior performance and better alignment with evaluation metrics in human pose estimation.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [10] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), a novel task to segment objects responsible for collision sounds in video frames using audio cues, with a focus on egocentric video where scenes are cluttered and interactions brief.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can recognize object properties from collision sounds. The task is challenging because collision sounds arise from interactions between two objects and depend on both, unlike isolated sound events.

Method: A weakly-supervised method using foundation models (CLIP and SAM2) for audio-conditioned segmentation, incorporating egocentric cues like objects in hands to identify potential collision sound sources.

Result: The approach outperforms competitive baselines by 3× and 4.7× in mIoU on two new benchmarks: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the CS3 task by leveraging foundation models and egocentric cues, achieving significant improvements over baselines on the introduced benchmarks.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [11] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Geometric Representation Regression (GRR), a geometrically-grounded alternative to Absolute Pose Regression that explicitly predicts disentangled 3D geometric representations (ray directions and pointmaps) from images, then uses a differentiable solver to recover the 6-DoF camera pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard APR models operate as black boxes that directly regress poses, leading to memorization rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. The authors aim to introduce geometric priors by modeling the inverse of novel view synthesis.

Method: Reformulate APR as inverse rendering: predict two disentangled geometric representations (ray bundle directions for rotation, pointmaps for translation) in world coordinates, then use a differentiable deterministic solver to compute the final 6-DoF pose.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, with explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions boosting performance.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process provides a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation compared to black-box APR approaches.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

*Xueyang Li,Zongren Wang,Yuliang Zhang,Zixuan Pan,Yu-Jen Chen,Nishchal Sapkota,Gelei Xu,Danny Z. Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical multi-branch model for bladder cancer recurrence prediction using multi-sequence MRI, achieving 78.6% AUC and providing a dedicated dataset for this challenging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bladder cancer has high recurrence rates (up to 78%) requiring accurate post-operative monitoring. Current MRI interpretation is challenging due to post-surgical alterations, and AI progress is hindered by lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment.

Method: Proposed H-CNN-ViT, a Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that selectively weights features from global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands. Processes each MRI modality independently to capture unique properties and enable targeted feature fusion.

Result: Achieved 78.6% AUC on their curated multi-sequence MRI dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art models for bladder cancer recurrence prediction.

Conclusion: The work provides both a valuable benchmark dataset and an effective model (H-CNN-ViT) that balances global and local feature extraction for improved bladder cancer recurrence prediction, with the model being publicly available.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

### [13] [QwenCLIP: Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via LLM Embeddings and Prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13876)
*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP replaces CLIP's limited text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module to handle long radiology reports, using learnable prompts for better cross-modal alignment and improved medical image-text understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder only accepts 77 tokens, which is insufficient for long radiology reports. Domain-specific encoders like PubMedBERT help but are still limited to 512 tokens and have shallow semantic understanding.

Method: Replace CLIP's text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduce learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment between medical images and long clinical text.

Result: QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed QwenCLIP framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging LLMs' extended context windows and richer representations for better medical vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining EfficientNet and VGG19 with custom components: Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer for smart feature weight variations and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer for redundancy removal, forming a multi-tiered framework.

Result: Achieved precision: 0.9, recall: 0.861, F1 score: 0.88, loss: 0.18, accuracy: 88.1%, significantly outperforming the baseline EfficientNet model.

Conclusion: The novel architecture successfully addresses traditional transfer learning constraints in medical imaging and contributes to developing automated diagnostic tools for lumbar spine pathology analysis.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

*Xin Hu,Taotao Jing,Renran Tian,Zhengming Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based approaches for autonomous driving suffer from inconsistent performance due to handcrafted prompts and lack robustness in real-world scenarios, limiting their practical application.

Method: Leverage VLMs as semantic enhancers to generate structured scene descriptions, then use multi-modal fusion of visual and linguistic features, and add post-hoc refinement using VLMs to improve prediction reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating improved reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable autonomous driving systems by changing their role from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

TL;DR: Uni-Hema is a unified multi-task model for digital hematopathology that integrates detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases using a multimodal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hematopathology models are limited to single tasks and cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology including malignant disorders, infectious conditions, and non-malignant red blood cell disorders.

Method: Built on Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at hierarchy level for different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling, visual question answering) at different granularity, leveraging 46 public datasets with over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs.

Result: Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task, single-dataset models across diverse hematological tasks while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology, demonstrating unified reasoning capabilities across complex hematological conditions.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,John A. Lory,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First weakly supervised pipeline for ephemeral gully detection using Vision Language Models to reduce manual labeling, with a novel dataset of 18,000+ remote sensing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies in agricultural fields are difficult to detect automatically due to short temporal cycles and scarcity of accurate labeled data, limiting machine learning to zero-shot approaches.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models to generate noisy labels, then employs teacher-student model with weak supervision where teacher learns from VLM labels and student learns using teacher-generated labels with noise-aware loss function.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to VLMs and label model alone when using weak supervision to train student model.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses ephemeral gully detection challenges by combining VLM knowledge with teacher-student weak supervision, providing the first dataset and pipeline for this task.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

### [19] [Temporal Realism Evaluation of Generated Videos Using Compressed-Domain Motion Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13897)
*Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Idil Bilge Altun,Zhihe Lu,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using motion vectors from compressed video streams to evaluate temporal realism in generative video models, revealing systematic motion discrepancies and improving downstream classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models have weak temporal realism, as most evaluation metrics focus on spatial appearance and lack sensitivity to motion dynamics.

Method: Extract motion vectors (MVs) from compressed video streams using H.264/HEVC codecs, compute statistical divergences (KL, JS, Wasserstein) between MV distributions of real and generated videos, and investigate MV-RGB fusion methods for classification.

Result: Experiments on GenVidBench show systematic motion discrepancies: Pika and SVD rank closest to real videos in entropy-based measures, VC2 and Text2Video-Zero perform well in MV-sum statistics, while CogVideo shows largest deviations. MV integration improves classification accuracy up to 99.0% with I3D backbone.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain motion vectors provide effective temporal signals for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and enhancing temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCVT studies focus on accuracy but overlook real-time performance and scalability, which are crucial for real-world deployment, especially as camera networks grow in city-scale applications.

Method: Uses edge devices for processing RTSP video streams with object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction, transmitting only lightweight metadata to a central workstation that performs cross-camera association using self-supervised camera link models with spatial-temporal constraints.

Result: Achieves real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams with an IDF1 score of 61.2 on the RoundaboutHD dataset, demonstrating both scalability and performance.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment, successfully balancing accuracy with practical deployment requirements.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks when CoT outputs become lengthy or complex, and increased dataset size doesn't always help due to varying data complexities.

Method: Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO) leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to structure training data progressively from simpler to more challenging examples.

Result: CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods including Visual-RFT, with improvements up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO, and shows exceptional efficiency and robustness in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed CuRPO approach effectively addresses the limitations of RL-based CoT reasoning in Visual Grounding tasks by using curriculum learning based on complexity indicators, delivering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretraining vision transformers on procedurally-generated data (no visual content) improves data efficiency and performance when followed by standard image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill generic inductive biases in vision transformers that are beneficial across modalities, bypassing visual-specific priors.

Method: Generate procedurally-generated data using simple algorithms like formal grammars (no visual/semantic content), pretrain ViTs with this data while bypassing visual patch embeddings, then follow with standard image-based training.

Result: 1% procedural data pretraining improves ImageNet-1k accuracy by over 1.7%, equivalent to 28% of ImageNet-1k data in terms of performance effect.

Conclusion: Procedural data pretraining offers a promising path for data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Motivation: To develop a robust cell segmentation method that can handle outliers in training data while maintaining sharp cell boundaries, with computational efficiency suitable for edge computing applications.

Method: Learn continuous scalar fields parameterized by neural networks (UNet) that are solutions to Poisson PDE and heat equation diffusion. Segmentation is performed using watershed method on these fields. Training minimizes only field residuals without regularization.

Result: Achieves competitive results on public datasets, demonstrating excellent cell segmentation with robust instance detection and sharp boundaries. The method is computationally efficient with low training/inference times and small memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed geometrically insightful approach using scalar fields provides a simple yet effective solution for cell segmentation that is robust to outliers, computationally efficient, and suitable for edge computing applications.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle with generalization to unseen scenarios, while existing VLM-based approaches create hybrid systems with inconsistencies or have prohibitive computational demands in end-to-end VLA frameworks.

Method: Introduces Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) with RiskHead module that distills causal risk estimates from VLMs into Bird's-Eye-View features, creating interpretable risk-attention maps that enhance BEV representations.

Result: Experiments on Bench2Drive benchmark show significant improvements in both perception and planning capabilities, effectively managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

Conclusion: RSD successfully enhances autonomous driving generalization by learning richer risk attention representations that align with human-like driving behavior, addressing key limitations in current systems.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Motivation: Current skill assessment models are specialized for individual sports and suffer from high costs and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports.

Method: Discovers skill-attributes that transcend sport boundaries, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback and proficiency levels for novel videos.

Result: Achieves gains up to 60% relative to state-of-the-art in both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: By abstracting shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes better than existing techniques and enriches multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

### [30] [CD-DPE: Dual-Prompt Expert Network based on Convolutional Dictionary Feature Decoupling for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14014)
*Xianming Gu,Lihui Wang,Ying Cao,Zeyu Deng,Yingfeng Ou,Guodong Hu,Yi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-prompt expert network with convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution that separates features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components and uses frequency and adaptive routing prompts to guide feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-contrast MRI super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution scans using reference images with different contrasts, but contrast disparities between modalities make it challenging to effectively utilize reference textures, leading to suboptimal feature integration.

Method: Proposes CD-DPE strategy with iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features, and dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) using frequency prompt for feature selection and adaptive routing prompt for optimal fusion method.

Result: Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets show CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CD-DPE method effectively addresses contrast disparities in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution through feature decoupling and dual-prompt guided fusion, achieving superior reconstruction quality and generalization performance.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

*Kaichen Zhou,Laura Dodds,Sayed Saad Afzal,Fadel Adib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding that uses multipath reflections to achieve privacy-preserving layout reconstruction and object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical sensors like RGB and LiDAR face occlusion issues and privacy concerns in indoor environments, while mmWave radar preserves privacy but has low spatial resolution, making geometric reasoning difficult.

Method: Uses Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement to model Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary reflections, combined with a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework to transform radar responses into layout reconstruction and object detection.

Result: Reduces Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) in layout reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art, and achieves 58% IoU for mmWave-based object detection on a dataset of 50,000 frames across 100 indoor trajectories.

Conclusion: RISE establishes a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar by leveraging multipath reflections traditionally treated as noise.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a 2.5D context-aware classifier for MRI plane orientation that achieves 99.49% accuracy and reduces errors by 60% compared to 2D models, with demonstrated utility in improving brain tumor detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated systems struggle to identify anatomical planes in MRI slices, and missing plane orientation metadata complicates analysis, increases domain shift in heterogeneous datasets, and reduces diagnostic classifier accuracy.

Method: Adopted a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. Trained on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images, and validated with a gated strategy using uncertainty scores for metadata-enhanced predictions.

Result: 2.5D method achieved 99.49% accuracy (vs 98.74% for 2D reference), reducing errors by 60%. In brain tumor detection, boosted accuracy from 97.0% to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

Conclusion: 2.5D context is crucial for accurate plane orientation classification, and the generated metadata significantly improves diagnostic tasks. The model is integrated into an open-source web application.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINGUAL is a framework that uses natural language instructions to automate medical image segmentation, reducing annotation effort by ~80% while achieving comparable or better performance than active learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in medical image segmentation is labor-intensive and cognitively demanding due to blurry boundaries. Language guidance offers a less demanding alternative to precise boundary delineation.

Method: LINGUAL receives natural language instructions from experts, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs corresponding sub-tasks without human intervention.

Result: The framework achieves comparable or superior performance to active learning baselines in active domain adaptation while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: Language-guided approaches like LINGUAL provide an effective alternative to traditional active learning, significantly reducing expert annotation effort while maintaining or improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

TL;DR: WaRPAD is a training-free AI-generated image detection method that uses self-supervised models' sensitivity to image resizing operations, achieving competitive performance across diverse datasets and 23 generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a training-free AI-generated image detection approach that doesn't require dataset-specific training and leverages self-supervised models' inherent properties without prior data knowledge.

Method: Uses self-supervised models pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop. Defines a base score function measuring embedding sensitivity to perturbations along high-frequency directions from Haar wavelet decomposition. Rescales images to multiples of model input size, divides into patches, computes base scores per patch, and averages for final detection score.

Result: Consistently achieves competitive performance on real datasets of diverse resolutions/domains and images from 23 generative models. Shows strong robustness to test-time corruptions and works across different self-supervised models.

Conclusion: WaRPAD provides an effective training-free solution for AI-generated image detection that leverages self-supervised models' invariance properties to cropping augmentations, demonstrating broad applicability and robustness.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

TL;DR: FashionMAC is a diffusion-based framework for garment-centric fashion image generation that preserves garment details without deformation and enables fine-grained control over human model appearance using region-adaptive attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fashion image generation suffer from garment texture distortions due to deformation processes and lack fine-grained controllability over model attributes, limiting their practical applications in e-commerce.

Method: Proposes a deformation-free framework that directly outpaints garments segmented from dressed persons, eliminating deformation. Introduces region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism with chained mask injection to enable fine-grained attribute control by adaptively predicting regions for each text attribute.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-quality fashion showcase images with faithful garment preservation and enhanced controllability.

Conclusion: FashionMAC successfully addresses key challenges in garment-centric fashion generation by eliminating deformation artifacts and providing fine-grained appearance control through innovative attention mechanisms, making it suitable for practical e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-based flood models are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time applications, while existing CNN approaches lack generalizability to unseen areas.

Method: Leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, incorporating physics-informed inputs to enhance interpretability.

Result: Substantially reduces computational time for high-fidelity flood maps without compromising accuracy, with superior generalizability across locations and faster adaptation via transfer learning.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion models enable real-time flood risk management with accurate, generalizable predictions while addressing black-box limitations through physics-informed approaches.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly object detection and classification are challenging tasks in computer vision, particularly for infrastructure inspection where manual methods are time-consuming and potentially dangerous.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Saliency-based defect region proposals leveraging local discontinuities in surface patterns, 2) YOLOX-based deep learning detector operating on saliency-enhanced images with bounding-box level brightness augmentation.

Result: Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the framework's performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows huge potential for implementation in self-powered inspection systems for concrete bridge structures.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a semantic-context-driven method for autoregressive image generation that improves instruction adherence and reduces visual artifacts through compressed semantic prefilling and semantic alignment guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models show promise for image generation but struggle with general image editing due to weak conditioning, poor instruction adherence, and visual artifacts.

Method: SCAR introduces two components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling (encoding high-level semantics into compact prefixes) and Semantic Alignment Guidance (aligning visual hidden states with target semantics during decoding).

Result: SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

Conclusion: SCAR effectively addresses the limitations of autoregressive models in image editing by providing efficient semantic conditioning and alignment, generalizing across different AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE introduces object-centric token compression for LVLMs using semantic segmentation to guide token merging, achieving state-of-the-art performance with extreme compression rates while maintaining 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory inefficiency in LVLMs caused by quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution, overcoming limitations of existing token compression methods that lack semantic understanding.

Method: Uses efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks as semantic prior for merging visual tokens into compact object-centric representations, with centroid-guided sorting to restore spatial coherence.

Result: Establishes SOTA on six benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings, maintains 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% visual tokens under extreme compression.

Conclusion: Demonstrates superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing, providing a new paradigm for visual token compression.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

TL;DR: Proposes Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS) using Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS) to generate complete classifier parameters from minimal inputs (1-shot image + text), eliminating need for training and achieving SOTA in few-shot medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome dependency on large annotated datasets in medical AI, especially for rare diseases where data is scarce and expert annotation is expensive.

Method: Leverage pre-trained generative engine to synthesize entire classifier parameters from minimal multi-modal inputs (single image + clinical text), generating weights for lightweight classifiers without training.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on ISIC 2018 and rare disease datasets, significantly outperforming few-shot/zero-shot methods in 1-shot and 5-shot regimes.

Conclusion: Enables rapid AI tool deployment for rare diseases with limited data, eliminating training requirements through direct parameter synthesis.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

TL;DR: Developed a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT scans, showing strong agreement with manual measurements and exceeding surgeon-to-surgeon consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual and semi-automated methods for measuring glenoid bone loss are time-consuming and subject to interreader variability, creating a need for more reliable and efficient measurement tools.

Method: Multi-stage deep learning pipeline: (1) U-Net for glenoid and humerus segmentation, (2) network for glenoid rim point detection, (3) PCA, projection, and circle fitting for bone loss percentage calculation.

Result: Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings (ICC 0.84 vs surgeon ICC 0.78), with good classification recall (0.714 for low, 0.857 for high bone loss) and no misclassification between low and high categories.

Conclusion: The method provides a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

TL;DR: DEER-3D introduces an error-driven framework using 3D scene editing to generate targeted counterfactuals for improving 3D-LLM grounding accuracy through iterative fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-LLMs have limited spatial grounding capabilities due to training data biases and scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved.

Method: DEER-3D follows a "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow that diagnoses predicate-level errors and executes minimal 3D scene edits (recoloring, repositioning) to create targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning.

Result: The framework consistently improves grounding accuracy across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks through iterative refinement.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven scene editing effectively bridges linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs, demonstrating significant improvements without costly scene reconstruction or large-scale data collection.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse dataset and 92.64% on ACDC dataset, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

*Fan Zhang,Haoyuan Ren,Fei Ma,Qiang Yin,Yongsheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMGeo is a promptable end-to-end transformer model for cross-view object geo-localization that uses click prompting and real-time object localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on drone-to-satellite tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-stage 'retrieval-matching' pipelines for cross-view object geo-localization suffer from cumulative errors due to significant viewpoint/scale differences and complex background interference between drone and satellite imagery.

Method: Uses fully transformer-based architecture with Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding, grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) to capture inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, and anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression via heat-map supervision.

Result: Achieves leading performance on drone-to-satellite task: 87.51% accuracy at IoU=0.25, 62.50% mIoU, and 61.45% on test set, significantly outperforming DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, 54.05%).

Conclusion: SMGeo demonstrates complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts, providing an effective end-to-end solution for cross-view object geo-localization with real-time interactive capabilities.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

### [45] [BCE3S: Binary Cross-Entropy Based Tripartite Synergistic Learning for Long-tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14097)
*Weijia Fan,Qiufu Li,Jiajun Wen,Xiaoyang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCE3S is a binary cross-entropy-based tripartite synergistic learning method for long-tailed recognition that improves feature compactness and classifier separability through joint, contrastive, and uniform learning components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-entropy-based methods struggle with feature learning and amplify imbalance effects in long-tailed recognition due to coupled imbalanced classifier vectors in Softmax denominator.

Method: Three BCE-based components: (1) joint learning for feature and classifier optimization, (2) contrastive learning for intra-class compactness, and (3) uniform learning for balanced classifier separability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets (CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018) with improved feature compactness and balanced classifier separability.

Conclusion: BCE3S effectively addresses long-tailed recognition challenges by decoupling imbalanced classifier vectors and synergistically improving feature properties through its tripartite learning approach.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIO-IR methods rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies that struggle with real-world scenarios containing various degradations, requiring a more unified and adaptable approach.

Method: Uses frozen MLLM as planner to analyze degraded images and generate frequency-aware plans, then employs LoRA-MoE module in diffusion executor with dynamic expert selection based on frequency features, plus adversarial training and frequency regularization loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Conclusion: FAPE-IR provides a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration by coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER is a reasoning-based implicit video editor that interprets implicit text queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require explicit descriptions with precise spatial and temporal specifications, which are impractical when users want to conceptualize edits through implicit queries about semantic properties or object relationships.

Method: RIVER decouples reasoning from generation using digital twin representations that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model performs multi-hop reasoning on this representation with implicit queries, then outputs structured instructions to guide a diffusion-based editor for pixel-level changes. Training uses reinforcement learning with rewards for reasoning accuracy and generation quality.

Result: RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark (100 videos with 519 implicit queries) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), surpassing six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RIVER successfully addresses the challenge of reasoning video editing by interpreting implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning and structured instruction generation, enabling more intuitive video editing without requiring explicit spatial and temporal specifications.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono successfully addresses the trade-off between model efficiency and performance, enabling practical real-time deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed A²GC-VPR, an asymmetric aggregation method with geometric constraints for visual place recognition that addresses distributional discrepancies between image features and cluster centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Sinkhorn algorithm in optimal transport-based aggregation symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers have substantially different distributions.

Method: Uses row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration for asymmetric matching, and incorporates geometric constraints through learnable coordinate embeddings fused with feature similarities.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets, showing improved matching accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The asymmetric aggregation with geometric constraints effectively handles distributional discrepancies and enhances spatial awareness in visual place recognition.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents cause over 20% of global traffic fatalities, but existing video systems only detect when incidents occur without providing insights into how they unfold across cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation using TG-VLM, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning using PhaVR-VLM, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning using a designated LLM.

Result: TG-VLM achieves mIoU of 0.4881 for phase segmentation; PhaVR-VLM achieves captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering; framework effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR advances AI-driven traffic safety analytics by systematically processing multi-view videos into structured diagnostic reports with causal chains and prevention strategies, enabling better understanding of pedestrian-vehicle incident dynamics.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

TL;DR: Coffee is a method that uses language to specify undesired concepts during fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models, preventing the model from learning these concepts without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for text-to-image models can learn unwanted concepts from training data and entangle them with user prompts, which is problematic for bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, and attribute disentanglement.

Method: Coffee keeps the embeddings of user prompts from aligning with undesired concepts by using language descriptions to regularize the adaptation process, requiring no additional training and allowing flexible modification of undesired concepts.

Result: Experimental results show Coffee effectively prevents text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Coffee provides an effective solution for controllable fine-tuning of diffusion models by using language to specify and prevent learning of undesired concepts, with advantages in flexibility and no additional training requirements.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SMART is a multimodal framework that enhances video moment retrieval by integrating audio cues and shot-level temporal structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video moment retrieval methods rely on coarse temporal understanding and single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. The authors aim to address these limitations by incorporating audio cues and fine-grained temporal structure.

Method: SMART integrates audio and visual features with Shot-aware Token Compression to selectively retain high-information tokens within each shot, reducing redundancy while preserving temporal details. It also uses refined prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues.

Result: SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 1.61% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA, and shows strong performance on QVHighlights.

Conclusion: The integration of audio cues and shot-level temporal structure through SMART effectively enhances multimodal representations for video moment retrieval, demonstrating the importance of fine-grained temporal understanding and multimodal fusion.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

TL;DR: The paper unifies convolution and self-attention under a single k-nearest neighbor framework, showing they differ only in neighbor selection criteria (spatial proximity vs feature similarity). The proposed ConvNN framework serves as a drop-in replacement enabling systematic exploration between these extremes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dissolve the apparent distinction between convolutional and transformer architectures in computer vision by revealing their fundamental connection through neighbor aggregation operations.

Method: Introduces Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN) framework that formalizes convolution and attention as special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation. Validated on CIFAR-10/100 with hybrid VGG branching and ConvNN in ViT architectures.

Result: Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets. ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other variants. Interpolating along the convolution-attention spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields.

Conclusion: The work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the distinction between convolution and attention, enabling more principled and interpretable vision architecture design through systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

TL;DR: Proposes an object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression in MLLMs, achieving 10% token usage while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level tokenization in MLLMs causes quadratic growth in image tokens, leading to computational burden and misalignment with human vision cognition, resulting in hallucination and redundancy.

Method: Object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression that aligns with human vision system.

Result: Achieves average 10% token usage while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior balance between compression ratio and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed object-level token compression method effectively reduces computational burden while maintaining high performance, aligning better with human vision cognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Motivation: Existing camera pose estimation methods rely on iterative render-compare-refine loops with NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, which incur significant computational overhead and hinder real-time performance in robotics applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Coarse 6DoF pose regression using Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention, 2) Refinement through feature matching and multi-model fusion with cross-correlation module aligning image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering.

Result: Significant performance improvement on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T&T+DB datasets, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots - 10x speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: iGaussian enables real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion, eliminating the computational bottleneck of iterative rendering while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for robotics applications.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Result: Achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and effective solution for few-shot precise event spotting, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable 3D shape reconstruction of hidden objects for applications in robotics, AR, and logistics, overcoming limitations of past mmWave methods that suffered from limited coverage and high noise.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) proposes candidate geometric surfaces, 2) uses transformer-based shape completion model designed for mmWave signals, 3) performs entropy-guided surface selection. Trained on synthetic point-clouds with generalization to real data.

Result: Achieves 72% recall (up from 54% in baselines) while maintaining 85% precision in head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Wave-Former successfully bridges wireless signals with vision-based shape completion, demonstrating physics-aware reconstruction of occluded objects with strong generalization from synthetic to real data.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: MCFormer is a novel vessel re-identification method that addresses intra-identity variations and local part missing through multi-scale correlation modeling using global and local correlation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel Re-ID methods adapted from pedestrian algorithms are ill-suited for handling unique vessel challenges like greater intra-identity variations and severe local part missing, which create outlier samples within the same identity.

Method: Proposes Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer) with two modules: Global Correlation Module (GCM) constructs global similarity affinity matrix for feature aggregation across all images, and Local Correlation Module (LCM) mines and aligns local features using dynamic memory bank to compensate for missing regions.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in maritime vessel re-identification.

Conclusion: MCFormer effectively addresses vessel-specific challenges by modeling multi-scale correlations, suppressing outlier effects, and enhancing feature robustness through integrated global and local feature correlation.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RiSe is a multimodal face anti-spoofing framework that addresses cross-domain generalization issues through asymmetric invariant risk minimization and multimodal synergy disentanglement to handle domain shifts and spurious inter-modal correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal face anti-spoofing methods suffer severe performance degradation in unseen domains due to two overlooked risks: modal representation invariant risk (class asymmetry amplifies generalization error) and modal synergy invariant risk (overfitting to domain-specific inter-modal correlations).

Method: Proposes RiSe framework with two components: 1) Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) that learns invariant spherical decision boundaries in radial space while preserving domain cues in angular space, and 2) Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) using self-supervised cross-sample mixing and disentanglement to enhance generalizable modal features.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments verify that RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance in multimodal face anti-spoofing.

Conclusion: RiSe effectively addresses cross-domain multimodal generalization challenges in face anti-spoofing by tackling both representation and synergy invariant risks, providing a provable framework for robust performance across unseen domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Result: Empirical evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, uncovering significant robustness gaps.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench provides actionable insights to guide development of more reliable and robust LVLMs, addressing a critical gap in visual understanding evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) struggles with unreliable pseudo-labels due to weak local models and computational constraints that prevent using large models on client devices.

Method: SAM-Fed leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients through dual knowledge distillation and an adaptive agreement mechanism for refining pixel-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed effectively addresses the limitations of FSSL in medical image segmentation by combining foundation model guidance with knowledge distillation, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency on client devices.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process all skeleton regions uniformly and use FIFO queues for negative samples, leading to motion information loss and suboptimal negative sample selection.

Result: Achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View and 71.2%/75.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, surpassing SOTA by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3% respectively; comparable performance on PKU-MMD with 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II.

Conclusion: DoGCLR demonstrates strong robustness in challenging scenarios and effectively addresses limitations of existing contrastive learning methods through game-theoretic sample optimization and entropy-based negative sample management.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach is highly efficient, lightweight, and deployable, suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

TL;DR: UniSER is a foundational versatile model that addresses diverse image degradations from soft effects (lens flare, haze, shadows, reflections) within a single framework, outperforming both specialist and generalist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use highly specialized models for individual degradation types, lacking scalability and failing to exploit shared underlying essences of restoration problems, while generalist models require detailed prompts and often fail at robust removal or scene preservation.

Method: Curated a massive 3.8M-pair dataset with novel physically-plausible data, fine-tuned a Diffusion Transformer with tailored training pipeline integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls to learn robust restoration priors.

Result: UniSER significantly outperforms both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach successfully addresses diverse soft effect degradations by leveraging their common essence as semi-transparent occlusions, demonstrating superior performance over specialized and general-purpose alternatives.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

TL;DR: GloTok is a global perspective tokenizer that uses codebook-wise histogram relation learning to create more uniform semantic distributions for better image generation, achieving SOTA results on ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenization methods use local semantic supervision, which limits semantic distribution uniformity. Since VA-VAE shows that uniform feature distributions improve generation performance, the authors aim to develop a method that models more uniform semantic distributions using global relational information.

Method: GloTok uses codebook-wise histogram relation learning to transfer dataset-wide semantics from pre-trained models to the semantic codebook. It also includes a residual learning module to recover fine-grained details and minimize reconstruction errors from quantization.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-1k show state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality. The method produces more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations that facilitate autoregressive model training without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during training.

Conclusion: GloTok successfully creates more uniform semantic distributions through global relational modeling, leading to improved image reconstruction and generation quality compared to locally supervised approaches.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

TL;DR: First end-to-end autonomous driving dataset collected entirely by autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions, containing 100+ hours of data with high-precision localization and detailed annotations for safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets collected by human-driving mode are insufficient for evaluating real behavioral safety of autonomous vehicles, necessitating data collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode.

Method: Collected over 100 hours of naturalistic data from production autonomous vehicles, segmented into 32,727 key frames with synchronized camera images, GNSS/IMU data (0.8cm accuracy), and 20Hz vehicle trajectories spanning past 6s and future 5s.

Result: Created comprehensive dataset with detailed 2D annotations of vehicles, pedestrians, traffic elements, and rich scenario attributes including driver intent, area types, lighting, weather, and traffic conditions.

Conclusion: The dataset provides sustainable foundation for AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation, with continuous expansion of 10+ hours weekly, enabling end-to-end motion planning model with 1.4m ADE on autonomous-driving frames.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

*Kangqiao Zhao,Shuo Huai,Xurui Song,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models using 3D global camouflage texture instead of 2D patches, achieving visual consistency and attack effectiveness across stereo viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks mostly target monocular perception with 2D patches, leaving stereo-based binocular depth estimation vulnerable and unexplored for physical adversarial examples.

Method: Uses 3D PAE with global camouflage texture, 3D stereo matching rendering module for real-world alignment, and novel merging attack for seamless background blending through fine-grained optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PAEs successfully fool stereo models into producing erroneous depth information with enhanced stealth and lethality compared to existing hiding attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D texture-enabled physical adversarial attack effectively compromises stereo matching models in autonomous driving, demonstrating significant vulnerability in binocular depth estimation systems.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

TL;DR: A hierarchical curriculum learning approach with fractal softmax for 3D aortic segmentation that addresses class imbalance and anatomical relationships, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and 5x inference acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aortic segmentation overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships and struggle with severe class imbalance in vascular structures, limiting clinical practicality for minimally invasive repairs.

Method: Curriculum learning strategy with novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning, progressively decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components, with two-stage inference for acceleration.

Result: 11.65% Dice score improvement over nnU-Net ResEnc M at epoch 50, 5.6% higher Dice than baselines on test set, and up to fivefold inference acceleration.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in aortic pathology intervention.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI) is a training-free framework that enables human-like video understanding through a three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review), structured video knowledge base, and open-source model ensemble, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods either process videos in single-pass with limited evidence revisit, or rely on expensive proprietary models/RL training. There's a need for flexible, training-free approaches that enable iterative refinement and complex reasoning.

Method: AVI uses: (1) three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) for global exploration and local analysis, (2) structured video knowledge base with entity graphs and multi-granularity tools, (3) open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight CV models and VLM.

Result: Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA show AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AVI provides an effective training-free framework for complex video reasoning that eliminates dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training, while maintaining competitive performance and improved interpretability.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

TL;DR: DetGain is an online data curation method for object detection that dynamically selects training samples based on their estimated contribution to improving dataset-level Average Precision, achieving consistent accuracy improvements across multiple detectors on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data drives progress in scale laws, but existing online sampling strategies don't extend well to object detection due to its structural complexity and domain gaps. There's a need for specialized online data curation methods for object detection.

Method: DetGain estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level AP based on prediction quality. It models global score distributions to efficiently estimate global AP changes and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive.

Result: Experiments on COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation to further enhance performance.

Conclusion: DetGain serves as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection, offering architecture-agnostic online data curation that consistently improves detection accuracy across various settings.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for robust white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation and localization that quantifies regional WMH distribution, showing regional measures outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, especially when combined with brain atrophy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most automated WMH segmentation methods only provide global lesion load and overlook spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions, missing important diagnostic information.

Method: Proposed deep learning framework for WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and ADNI cohort, quantifying WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combining with brain structure volumes.

Result: Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, with integration of atrophy metrics reaching AUC up to 0.97. Anterior white matter tracts show reproducible association with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD.

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification provides added diagnostic value, and incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

*Weimin Bai,Suzhe Xu,Yiwei Ren,Jinhua Hao,Ming Sun,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR is an amortized inference framework that distills a bidirectional video diffusion model into a causal autoregressive student for ultra-fast video reconstruction, achieving real-time performance (35+ FPS) while matching diffusion-based quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video inverse problems require high perceptual quality with tight latency constraints for streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR applications. Current diffusion-based approaches either cause temporal artifacts or are too slow for real-time use due to iterative sampling.

Method: Distill a bidirectional video diffusion teacher model into a causal autoregressive student that performs single-pass inference. Replace VAE with high-efficiency LeanVAE via teacher-space regularized distillation. The approach is prior-driven and doesn't require external paired data.

Result: Achieves over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with up to 100x speedup over iterative video diffusion solvers. Matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in quality for streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based video reconstruction is now compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, making high-quality video restoration practical for modern vision systems.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CCSD framework for brain tumor segmentation that handles missing MRI modalities using cross-modal self-distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical settings often have missing MRI modalities, which severely compromises deep learning segmentation model performance and generalizability.

Method: Uses shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture with hierarchical modality self-distillation and progressive modality combination distillation to simulate gradual modality dropout.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: CCSD effectively addresses the challenge of missing modalities in clinical MRI data through flexible cross-modal self-distillation strategies.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) for diverse blind face restoration using text-to-image diffusion with measurement constraints to handle one-to-many reconstruction nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind face restoration methods produce deterministic results but fail to capture the one-to-many nature where low-quality inputs can correspond to multiple plausible high-quality reconstructions.

Method: Formulates BFR as measurement-constrained generative task using text-to-image diffusion with Forward Measurement (aligns with input structures) and Reverse Measurement (creates projection spaces for prompt alignment).

Result: MCS generates prompt-aligned diverse face reconstructions and outperforms existing BFR methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed MCS approach effectively addresses the one-to-many nature of blind face restoration through measurement-constrained sampling in diffusion models.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates tabular vs imaging-based representations for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, finding clinical features best predict severe decline while transformer-based MRI embeddings better identify stable individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management, but tabular predictors have limited ability to capture subtle brain changes.

Method: Introduced trajectory-aware labeling via Dynamic Time Warping clustering, trained 3D Vision Transformer via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized MRI data, and compared embeddings against tabular representations and convolutional baselines using traditional ML and deep learning classifiers.

Result: Clinical/volumetric features achieved highest AUCs (~0.70) for predicting mild/severe progression, while ViT MRI embeddings were most effective for distinguishing stable individuals (AUC 0.71). All approaches struggled with moderate progression group.

Conclusion: Clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, while transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

TL;DR: Proposes an autoregressive diffusion model for real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation that processes audio in streaming chunks to handle variable-length inputs with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based methods that process entire audio sequences at once, causing poor performance on long sequences and high latency.

Method: Uses autoregressive diffusion with limited past frames as historical context combined with audio input to create dynamic conditions for iterative facial motion generation.

Result: Achieves real-time synthesis with high-quality results and flexibility for varying audio lengths, demonstrated through an interactive demo.

Conclusion: The streaming autoregressive approach effectively solves latency and length limitations while maintaining high-quality 3D facial animation.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Result: Achieves artery-vein segmentation performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models while using simpler architecture.

Conclusion: Time-resolved preprocessing can unlock deep learning potential for Doppler holography, enabling better quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for 3D human motion prediction that uses quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties and introduces auxiliary learning objectives to enhance spatio-temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely too much on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into passive learning traps that result in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms.

Method: Proposes APS with two modules: (1) data perception module that projects poses into quotient space to decouple motion geometry from coordinate redundancy using tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, and (2) network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning by masking joints or injecting noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance with large improvements: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: APS is model-agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual capabilities, effectively overcoming limitations of passive learning approaches in 3D human motion forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR is a parameter-efficient framework that enhances foundation models for monocular depth estimation through weakly supervised self-training with regularization, improving robustness in unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of foundation models in monocular depth estimation when some downstream task data is available, addressing the need for better generalization in diverse and unseen domains.

Method: Uses dense self-training with structural self-supervision, semantically-aware hierarchical normalization using instance segmentation maps, cost-efficient pairwise ordinal depth annotations as weak supervision, and weight regularization to anchor LoRA updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: WeSTAR effectively enhances the robustness of MDE foundation models through parameter-efficient adaptation with multiple regularization strategies, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Method: Used 1000 images from IMDB-Clean dataset processed in seven different resolutions (7000 total samples), evaluated using DeepFace and InsightFace with MAE, SD, and MedAE metrics.

Result: Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels (MAE: 10.83 years for DeepFace, 7.46 years for InsightFace). Low resolutions substantially increase MAE, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Conclusion: Input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on age estimation accuracy, with 224x224 being the optimal resolution for both frameworks, and InsightFace providing better overall performance than DeepFace.

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

TL;DR: A GNSS-free collaborative perception framework using LiDAR localization with pose confidence estimation and spatio-temporal alignment for robust multi-agent perception in GNSS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNSS-based localization fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult for multi-agent collaborative perception.

Method: Proposes Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) for compact pose estimation and Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for confidence-aware spatial alignment with temporal context. Also introduces V2VLoc dataset for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on V2VLoc dataset under GNSS-denied conditions and shows effectiveness on real-world V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust collaborative perception without GNSS dependency through LiDAR-based localization and confidence-aware alignment.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework that integrates ECG signals with anatomical priors for improved myocardial scar segmentation from LGE cardiac MRI, using temporal-aware feature fusion to handle non-simultaneous acquisitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate myocardial scar segmentation from LGE cardiac MRI is challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. ECG signals provide complementary physiological information about conduction abnormalities that can help localize scarred regions.

Method: Proposed multimodal framework integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from AHA-17 atlas. Introduces Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism to dynamically weight and fuse features based on acquisition time difference between ECGs and LGE-MRIs.

Result: Achieved substantial gains over state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463, with high precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043).

Conclusion: Integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to 'see beyond the image', setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Method: Created ManipBench with 450K+ manipulated images from 25 state-of-the-art editing models across 12 categories, including 100K images with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations. Developed ManipShield using MLLM with contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders.

Result: ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance on ManipBench and public datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen manipulation models.

Conclusion: Both ManipBench and ManipShield address limitations of existing benchmarks and methods, providing comprehensive evaluation and effective unified detection capabilities for AI-edited image manipulations.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework that enhances synthetic video realism by preserving multi-level structures using diffusion models without fine-tuning, leveraging structure-aware guidance from auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the photorealism of synthetic videos from simulators while maintaining structural and semantic consistency with the original content.

Method: Uses a diffusion video foundational model conditioned on structure-aware information (depth maps, semantic maps, edge maps) extracted from synthetic videos via an auxiliary model, without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency while achieving state-of-the-art photorealism quality.

Conclusion: The approach provides a simple yet powerful zero-shot solution for enhancing synthetic video realism while preserving structural integrity.

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

TL;DR: Proposes GSLR framework using 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting to overcome t-SVD limitations in multi-dimensional image representation, achieving superior local high-frequency information capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key limitations of t-SVD: coarse latent tensor approximation that fails to capture spatial local high-frequency information, and fixed transform matrix basis atoms that cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along mode-3 fibers.

Method: Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework using tailored 2D Gaussian splatting for latent tensor generation and 1D Gaussian splatting for transform matrix generation, with both components being indispensable and complementary.

Result: Extensive experiments show GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-dimensional image recovery, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: GSLR provides a compact and continuous representation for multi-dimensional images with powerful representation capability for local high-frequency information, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

TL;DR: VARC frames the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as a vision-centric image-to-image translation problem using Vision Transformers, achieving 60.4% accuracy on ARC-1 and closing the gap to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC tasks are inherently visual but have been primarily approached as language problems. The authors argue for a vision-centric perspective to better leverage the visual nature of these abstract reasoning tasks.

Method: Represent ARC inputs on a "canvas" as natural images and apply Vision Transformers (ViT) for image-to-image mapping. The model is trained from scratch on ARC data and uses test-time training for generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: VARC achieves 60.4% accuracy on ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods trained from scratch and being competitive with leading LLMs.

Conclusion: Vision-centric approaches are effective for abstract reasoning tasks like ARC, with VARC demonstrating that standard vision architectures can achieve strong performance and close the gap to human-level reasoning.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

TL;DR: VLM3D repurposes vision-language models as differentiable semantic and spatial critics to address coarse semantic alignment and poor 3D spatial understanding in text-to-3D generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D models struggle with fine-grained prompt details and geometric inconsistencies, failing in part assembly and spatial relationships.

Method: Uses dual-query critic signals from VLM's Yes/No log-odds to assess semantic fidelity and geometric coherence, applicable to both optimization-based and feed-forward pipelines.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmarks and actively corrects spatial errors in SOTA 3D models through test-time guidance.

Conclusion: VLM3D provides a principled framework to inject VLM's language-grounded understanding of semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) including semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity by creating intermediate domain bridges.

Method: Construct IDP with source feature embeddings as codebook, reconstruct target features, and use proxies for fast domain alignment through collaborative learning of reconstruction and transformation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks by significant margins.

Conclusion: Intermediate domain proxies effectively bridge source and target domains, enabling superior cross-domain few-shot learning performance through collaborative reconstruction and transformation learning.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Motivation: Existing implicit surface reconstruction methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure tight fitting between reconstructed surfaces and input point cloud data, leading to potential inaccuracies in shape representation.

Method: Proposes NeuralSSD solver based on neural Galerkin method with a novel energy equation that balances point cloud reliability, and a 3D convolutional network that learns spatial information for superior optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, demonstrating superior surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD provides an effective framework for high-quality 3D surface reconstruction from point clouds by ensuring tight surface fitting and leveraging learned 3D information, advancing the state of implicit surface reconstruction.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

TL;DR: NeuralBoneReg is a self-supervised framework for modality-agnostic bone surface registration in orthopedic surgery, using neural UDFs and MLP-based registration to align intraoperative point clouds with preoperative models without requiring inter-subject training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In computer-assisted orthopedic surgery, precise registration between preoperative and intraoperative data is challenging due to modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities. Current methods are error-prone, creating a need for robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration.

Method: NeuralBoneReg uses two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align intraoperative point clouds with the neural UDF.

Result: NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across three datasets: UltraBones100k (1.68°/1.86 mm), UltraBones-Hip (1.88°/1.89 mm), and SpineDepth (3.79°/2.45 mm), demonstrating strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg provides robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS, operating self-supervised without inter-subject training data and showing strong performance across different bone anatomies and imaging modalities.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

TL;DR: Diff-NAF is an iterative framework combining Neural Attenuation Fields with dual-branch conditional diffusion models to enhance CT reconstruction quality under ultra-sparse-view conditions in multi-source stationary CT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-source stationary CT enables rapid imaging but suffers from degraded reconstruction quality under ultra-sparse-view sampling, where traditional methods fail due to inaccurate interpolation and unsatisfactory results.

Method: Diff-NAF uses an iterative approach: initial NAF training with sparse projections, Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis to generate new views, Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement, and iterative incorporation of refined projections as pseudo-labels.

Result: Experimental results on simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data show that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions, progressively enhancing projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed Diff-NAF framework effectively addresses ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges through iterative refinement, yielding high-quality reconstructions where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

TL;DR: Dental3R is a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral smartphone photos, addressing challenges of large view baselines, inconsistent lighting, and specular surfaces through intelligent image pairing and wavelet-regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intraoral scanning methods are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which relies on sparse smartphone imagery. Existing 3DGS methods struggle with the clinical triad of unposed photographs due to large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces, leading to unstable pose estimation and over-smoothed reconstructions that lose diagnostic details.

Method: Proposes Dental3R with two key components: 1) Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) that selects high-value image pairs for stable geometry initialization, and 2) wavelet-regularized 3DGS training using discrete wavelet transform to enforce band-limited fidelity, preserving fine dental details while suppressing artifacts.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases. Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R provides a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D dental reconstruction from sparse smartphone photos, enabling remote tele-orthodontics by addressing key challenges in pose estimation and detail preservation through intelligent pairing and wavelet regularization.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: StepsNet is a generalized residual architecture that addresses shortcut degradation and limited width issues in deep networks by separating features along channels and progressively learning through stacked blocks with increasing width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep residual networks struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements due to shortcut degradation and depth-width trade-offs, calling for more advanced designs to unleash the potential of deeper networks.

Method: Separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width, mitigating shortcut degradation and limited width problems.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance over residual models across diverse tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling.

Conclusion: StepsNet serves as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture, bridging the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free framework for structured dental understanding from intraoral 3D scans, combining geometry-aware arch-flattening with dental knowledge-guided reasoning for robust performance across various clinical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning approaches for intraoral 3D scan analysis suffer from modality-specific training requirements, dependency on large annotated datasets, and limited generalization across devices and scanning conditions. Raw intraoral meshes also present challenges with arch pose variation, incomplete geometry, and lack of texture cues.

Method: ArchMap uses a geometry-aware arch-flattening module to standardize raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned multi-view projections, and constructs a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain symbolic reasoning.

Result: Validated on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, ArchMap demonstrates robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and identification of clinical conditions (crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, caries). It achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability compared to supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines.

Conclusion: ArchMap shows that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning provides a practical and scalable training-free solution for structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in digital orthodontics.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Ji Jiang,Tong Chen,Zhe Tang,Zhengyong Jiang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSCR is a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scans and lateral cephalometric radiographs, addressing challenges like projective magnification, geometric distortion, and low-contrast dental crowns in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle with real clinical cephalograms due to projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation, leading to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments.

Method: The method constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) for unified anatomical coordinate system, generates radiograph-like projections via surface-based DRR with Gaussian splatting, and performs registration using 2D similarity transform optimized with symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule.

Result: Evaluation on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases shows substantial reductions in landmark error (especially at posterior teeth), tighter dispersion on lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at curve level, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D-2D alignment, providing a reliable solution for orthodontic diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: ARC-Chapter demonstrates clear performance improvements with data scaling (both in volume and label intensity) and provides a powerful solution for video chaptering that generalizes well to real-world applications and downstream tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting improves 3DGS by using source images for fine details and view-dependent effects, combining base 3DGS rendering with learned residuals from training images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with spatially varying colors and view-dependent effects due to limited spherical harmonics, and existing augmentation methods either fail with complex scenes or have high storage costs.

Method: Model pixel color as combination of base 3DGS rendering and learned residuals from neighboring training images, enabling accurate surface alignment and high-frequency detail rendering.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality on standard NVS benchmarks without increasing storage footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed image-based approach effectively enhances 3DGS for fine details and view-dependent effects while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O3SLM is a new Large Vision Language Model that addresses the limitation of existing LVLMs in understanding hand-drawn sketches by introducing a large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle to interpret abstract visual inputs like hand-drawn sketches, which offer intuitive ways to express concepts that are hard to describe textually. The main bottleneck is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly model sketches, photorealistic images, and natural language instructions.

Method: The paper presents two key contributions: (1) a new large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets for pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. The model is evaluated on multiple sketch-based tasks including object localization, counting, image retrieval (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and visual question answering.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation incorporates three existing sketch datasets (QuickDraw!, Sketchy, Tu Berlin) along with the newly generated SketchVCL dataset.

Conclusion: O3SLM successfully addresses the sketch comprehension limitations of existing LVLMs through its novel dataset and model architecture, demonstrating superior performance across various sketch-based reasoning tasks and establishing a new benchmark for sketch understanding in vision-language models.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes JFD3, an end-to-end joint feature-domain deblurring and detection framework for infrared UAV images with motion blur, using dual-branch architecture with shared weights to enhance discriminative features for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared UAV target images suffer from motion blur that reduces contrast between target and background, and existing deblurring methods focus on visual quality rather than enhancing task-relevant features for detection.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with shared weights where clear branch guides blurred branch; includes feature restoration network with feature-level supervision, frequency structure guidance module, and feature consistency self-supervised loss.

Result: Achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency on IRBlurUAV benchmark containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images.

Conclusion: JFD3 effectively enhances discriminative feature representation for detection under blur conditions through joint feature-domain deblurring and detection approach.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm that quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using 3D shoulder landmarks to assess compliance with biometric document pose requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in automated quality assessment for biometric identity documents, specifically the lack of quantitative methods to evaluate shoulder presentation compliance with international standards.

Method: Uses 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks from pose estimation frameworks to quantify shoulder yaw and roll angles, evaluated on 121 portrait images.

Result: SPE scores showed strong correlation (r ≈ 0.80) with human labels, and error-versus-discard analysis confirmed effectiveness in identifying non-compliant samples.

Conclusion: The SPE algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrollment systems for biometric identity documents.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects like traffic lights and signs, which poses safety risks.

Method: TLS-Assist converts traffic light and sign detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. It's plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups.

Result: Evaluation on LangAuto benchmark in CARLA showed relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist effectively addresses the safety limitations of LLM-based driving agents by providing explicit traffic rule enforcement through structured detection feedback, significantly improving driving performance and reducing traffic violations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0 is an improved dataset for 3D human motion estimation that addresses limitations of the original BEDLAM dataset by adding more diverse cameras, realistic motions, body shapes, clothing, hair, environments, and shoes, significantly improving training for world coordinate human estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods estimate human motion in image coordinates, but many applications require world coordinate estimation, which is challenging with both human and camera motion. Progress has been limited by lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement.

Method: Created BEDLAM2.0 dataset with more diverse and realistic cameras/camera motions, increased diversity in body shape, motions, clothing, hair, 3D environments, and added shoes missing in original BEDLAM.

Result: BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. State-of-the-art methods trained on BEDLAM2.0 show significant accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 provides a superior dataset for 3D human pose and motion regressors, particularly for world coordinate estimation, with rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, camera motions, and 3D assets available for research.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

*Shuyi Geng,Tao Zhou,Yi Zhou*

TL;DR: LAVA introduces a novel Domain Incremental Learning framework that uses language-based anchors to maintain consistent relative geometry between visual representations across domains, avoiding both inter-domain interference and knowledge fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DIL methods face a dilemma: unified visual spaces cause inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, while isolated domain-specific parameters create knowledge islands that hamper knowledge reuse and cause forgetting.

Method: LAVA replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by text-based reference anchors. It guides visual representations to preserve consistent relative geometry defined by pairwise semantic similarities between class names.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LAVA's language-anchored visual alignment effectively bridges domains, enables retrieval of prior knowledge, and facilitates robust feature aggregation while mitigating forgetting in Domain Incremental Learning.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniometric landmark localization is time-consuming and requires expertise, while current automatic methods lack reliability due to insufficient large-scale validation.

Method: 1) Automatic landmark annotation on 2D skull X-rays using trained YOLO-pose models; 2) Cross-modal matching by converting landmarks to graph representations and finding semantic correspondence using cross-attention and optimal transport.

Result: Extensive experiments on S2F and CUHK datasets show significant improvements in reliability and accuracy for cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness in forensic craniofacial identification, providing more reliable and accurate cross-modal matching compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CATDiet, a training approach that simulates infant visual development stages (grayscale-to-color, blur-to-sharp, temporal continuity) for self-supervised learning models, showing enhanced robustness and biologically-aligned developmental patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ecological advantages of staged "visual diets" by simulating how newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision that gradually sharpens during development.

Method: Train self-supervised learning models on object-centric videos under CATDiet constraints (Color, Acuity, Temporal continuity), then develop CombDiet that initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity.

Result: CATDiet variants show enhanced robustness in object recognition across 10 datasets and exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns. CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception.

Conclusion: The developmental progression of early infant visual experience provides a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-query text-to-image retrieval by enabling interactive, conversational refinement of image searches with better controllability and fault tolerance.

Method: Two-module framework: Dialog Refiner Module actively queries users to extract essential information and generate precise descriptions; Image Refiner Module identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions to reduce visual-semantic discrepancy.

Result: Significantly improves target image hit accuracy compared to initial-description-only baselines, achieving higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience across diverse image datasets.

Conclusion: The dialogue-based approach with synergistic module integration provides superior performance over conventional methods, demonstrating the value of interactive refinement in text-to-image retrieval.

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

*Bayu Adhi Tama,Jianwu Wang,Vandana Janeja,Mostafa Cham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-guided deep learning framework for subglacial bed topography prediction that combines residual learning over BedMachine prior with physical constraints to achieve accurate and physically plausible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar observations of subglacial bed topography are sparse and uneven, making accurate ice sheet modeling challenging. Current methods lack sufficient physical constraints and generalization capabilities.

Method: DeepLabV3+ decoder with ResNet-50 encoder trained with physics-guided residual learning. Uses mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity constraints, prior consistency, and masked Huber loss with confidence modulation.

Result: Outperforms U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and plain CNN across two Greenland regions. Achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity with spatially coherent, physically plausible beds.

Conclusion: The residual-over-prior design combined with physics constraints enables robust operational mapping under domain shift, providing accurate subglacial bed topography suitable for ice sheet modeling.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of conventional optimal transport methods that require iterative transport plan computation during training, which slows down the optimization process.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian splatting-based approach to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, computes transport plan using Bayesian probability, and derives a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport for network optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on crowd counting and landmark detection tasks validate the effectiveness of GST, showing it eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: GST provides an efficient alternative to conventional optimal transport schemes by leveraging Gaussian splatting to create transport plans, significantly improving training efficiency without sacrificing performance in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

TL;DR: SEED-SR is a novel approach that performs super-resolution in segmentation-aware latent space instead of pixel space, enabling 20× scale factor improvements for smallholder farm boundary delineation from satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-based super-resolution methods fail for smallholder farm delineation because they optimize for perceptual quality rather than downstream task features, and can't handle the large scale factors needed to combine high-resolution (annual) and low-resolution (weekly) satellite images.

Method: Uses conditional latent diffusion models and geo-spatial foundation models to bypass explicit pixel-space super-resolution, instead performing super-resolution directly in a segmentation-aware latent space.

Result: Achieves 20× scale factor and demonstrates 25.5% relative improvement in instance segmentation and 12.9% improvement in semantic segmentation metrics over state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods on two large real datasets.

Conclusion: The segmentation-aware latent space approach enables unprecedented scale factors and significantly outperforms traditional two-step approaches for agricultural monitoring applications requiring frequent farm boundary updates.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

TL;DR: PAMM is a novel decoder-based framework using state space models for multi-task dense prediction, featuring dual parameter experts and Hilbert scanning to enhance task interactions and 2D feature perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use convolutions and attention for task interactions, but there's a need for better modeling of task inter-relations in multi-task dense prediction using state space models' rich parameters.

Method: PAMM leverages state space models with dual parameter experts for task-specific priors, uses S4 for global integration, and employs Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning for 2D feature sequence construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in multi-task dense prediction.

Conclusion: PAMM provides an effective framework for multi-task dense prediction by enhancing task interconnectivity through state space models and improved 2D feature perception.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT is a novel LDCT enhancement method inspired by human visual system principles, using semantic-aware feature extraction and global-local processing to preserve critical anatomical details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT reduces radiation risk but degrades image quality. Existing methods often over-smooth and lose critical diagnostic details. Need for methods that preserve perceptually relevant features for radiologists.

Method: Two main components: 1) Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex) integrates semantic priors from DINOv2 with local features, 2) Global-Local State-Space block captures long-range and multiscale features. Plus Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) based on human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Mayo2016 dataset show D-PerceptCT outperforms SOTA methods in preserving structural and textural information in LDCT images.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT effectively enhances LDCT images by incorporating human visual system principles and semantic awareness, providing better preservation of diagnostically important features compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using in-air natural images as reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions to create synthetic datasets, overcoming the limitation of scarce high-quality paired datasets in underwater image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for underwater image restoration are constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets, as obtaining pristine reference labels in underwater scenes is difficult.

Conclusion: The research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement, with the generated dataset publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo-VAE decouples video content into keyframe, motion, and residual components with dedicated encoders to achieve compact latent representation and superior video reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs overlook similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling and inefficient representation.

Method: Decompose video into keyframe, motion, and residual components; use dedicated encoders for each component with shared 3D decoder; employ decoupled adaptation strategy with sequential training of partial encoders.

Result: Achieves superior video reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE provides an effective framework for compact video representation through explicit content decoupling and dedicated component modeling.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: A method to represent multiple neural signed distance functions (SDFs) in a common space that preserves high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SDFs work well for single shapes/scenes but struggle with multiple SDFs due to limited latent space information and loss of geometry details. Current methods pose obstacles for analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity details.

Method: Combines generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Introduces a novel sampling strategy for training queries that improves efficiency and eliminates artifacts from other SDFs.

Result: Validated on widely used benchmarks, showing advantages over latest methods in representative ability and compactness. Numerical and visual evaluations demonstrate improved performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully overcomes limitations of neural SDFs for multiple shapes by enabling high-fidelity geometry preservation with compact representations through hybrid learning strategies and optimized sampling.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Motivation: To address the challenging problem of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance in hand-object interaction scenes without relying on any object priors, particularly dealing with complex dynamics, mutual occlusion, and edge blur.

Method: Uses dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians featuring optimizable parameters for piecewise linear structural representation. Incorporates hand information into object deformation fields and employs a progressive optimization strategy with explicit regularizations for smooth motion and physical reality.

Result: The approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenges of modeling hand-object interactions without object priors, achieving superior reconstruction quality through interaction-aware representations and progressive optimization strategies.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processing audio-video token sequences creates computational bottlenecks in omnimodal LLMs, and existing token compression methods don't address the need for joint multimodal token compression.

Method: OmniZip identifies salient audio tokens, computes audio retention scores for time groups to guide video token pruning, uses cross-modal similarity to preserve audio anchor cues, and applies interleaved spatio-temporal compression for video tokens.

Result: Achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction compared to other top-performing methods while maintaining performance without requiring training.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively bridges the gap in multimodal token compression for audio-video understanding, providing significant computational efficiency gains while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses a 3D-aware flow-matching framework with cross-section context fusion via a lightweight ControlNet, retrieves morphologically corresponding spots in shared feature space, combines learned ZINB prior with spatial-empirical prior from neighboring sections, and employs global attention for linear scaling with spot count.

Result: Consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Conclusion: HoloTea advances the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening understanding of disease through scalable 3D-aware transcriptomics prediction.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

### [127] [Fusing Biomechanical and Spatio-Temporal Features for Fall Prediction: Characterizing and Mitigating the Simulation-to-Reality Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14620)
*Md Fokhrul Islam,Sajeda Al-Hammouri,Christopher J. Arellano,Kavan Hazeli,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BioST-GCN, a dual-stream model combining pose and biomechanical data for fall prediction, achieving 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score improvements over baseline on simulated datasets, but faces significant simulation-reality gap with performance dropping from 89.0% to 35.9% in zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major cause of injury in older adults, and vision-based fall prediction systems are limited by scarce real fall data. This study aims to develop better fall prediction models while addressing the simulation-reality gap.

Method: Developed Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN) - a dual-stream model combining pose and biomechanical information using cross-attention fusion, with spatio-temporal attention mechanisms for interpretability.

Result: Model outperformed baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on simulated datasets, achieving 89.0% F1-score with full supervision. However, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects dropped to 35.9%, revealing significant simulation-reality gap due to biases in simulated data.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need to bridge the simulation-reality gap through personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations, particularly those with unique kinematic profiles like diabetes or frailty patients.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from overfitting in sparse-view scenarios due to increased anisotropy in flattened Gaussians, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality and degraded novel view synthesis performance.

Method: Introduces Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to bridge rendering quality and geometry estimation, and Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency using both training and unseen views to mitigate overfitting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets, demonstrating more accurate and detailed surface reconstruction while preserving high-quality novel view rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses overfitting in sparse-view Gaussian Splatting by jointly enhancing surface reconstruction and view synthesis through geometry-texture alignment and multi-view consistency enforcement.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SLAM-AGS is a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that addresses computational cytology challenges by combining weakly supervised similarity learning with self-supervised contrastive learning, using Adaptive Gradient Surgery to stabilize training and improve performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: unreliable instance-level labels that are costly to obtain, and extremely low witness rates (as low as 0.5%). These issues make traditional supervised learning approaches impractical for cytology applications.

Method: Proposes SLAM-AGS framework that jointly optimizes: (i) weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches, (ii) self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches. Uses Adaptive Gradient Surgery to handle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. Integrates pretrained encoder into attention-based Multiple Instance Learning for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference through Adaptive Gradient Surgery enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks in computational cytology, particularly at low witness rates where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: RepAir is a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines nnU-Net with topology correction, outperforming existing methods on both healthy and pathological CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual airway annotation is impractical and automated U-Net-based methods often produce disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction from chest CT scans.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) nnU-Net-based segmentation produces initial airway mask, 2) skeleton-based algorithm identifies discontinuities and proposes reconnections, 3) 1D convolutional classifier determines true anatomical branches vs false paths.

Result: Outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches (Bronchinet, NaviAirway) on both voxel-level and topological metrics across ATM'22 (healthy subjects) and AeroPath (severe pathology) datasets, producing more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees.

Conclusion: RepAir provides robust airway segmentation that maintains high accuracy while producing more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees, essential for reliable quantitative lung analysis.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

*Sriram Srinivasan,Srinivasan Aruchamy,Siva Ram Krisha Vadali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyMAD is a deep neural architecture that uses spatio-temporal feature fusion to detect and distinguish overlapping seismic activities like human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling in border surveillance applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismic sensors are effective for border surveillance due to their covert nature, but accurately detecting and distinguishing simultaneous activities remains challenging due to complex and noisy seismic signals, which can lead to misclassification and reduced reliability.

Method: HyMAD integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by an RNN, employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations, and uses a cross-modal fusion module for robust multi-label classification of seismic events.

Result: The method was evaluated on real-world field recordings from border surveillance scenarios and demonstrated competitive performance in generalizing to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

Conclusion: HyMAD offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications, effectively addressing the challenge of detecting overlapping activities in border surveillance.

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free method for ultra-high-resolution video generation using pretrained video Diffusion Transformers with inward sliding window attention and cross-attention override strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic time and memory complexity of attention mechanisms in Transformer-based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive.

Method: Inward sliding window attention mechanism with dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with cross-attention override strategy, plus cross-attention caching for efficiency.

Result: Generates ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency, achieving superior performance on VBench compared to training-based alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free approach successfully enables high-resolution video generation while maintaining visual fidelity and global coherence, with competitive efficiency.

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSD unifies encoder, decoder, and diffusion into a single end-to-end trainable network by addressing latent collapse through a self-distillation framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard latent diffusion models use complex three-part architectures that are computationally inefficient and prevent unification with single-network vision foundation models.

Method: Proposed Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD) framework with modified training objectives to stabilize latent space, enabling stable end-to-end training of a single network for encoding, decoding, and diffusion.

Result: Achieved FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with 42M/118M/205M parameters on ImageNet 256×256 conditional generation using only 50 training epochs, without classifier-free-guidance.

Conclusion: DSD successfully unifies diffusion model components into a single network, overcoming latent collapse and achieving excellent performance with efficient training.

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D urban datasets are difficult to explore due to computational bottlenecks, complex geometry causing occlusion, and inefficient manual viewpoint adjustments that hinder large-scale analysis.

Method: Proposes a view-based approach using vector fields to encode environment views, supported by a neural field-based implicit representation of 3D environments that enables both direct queries (view assessment indices) and inverse queries (occlusion avoidance and pattern matching).

Result: Validated through quantitative experiments, real-world case studies, and expert feedback, showing effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses urban analysis challenges by enabling efficient 3D data exploration and supporting key tasks like visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and visual impact analysis of new developments.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Motivation: Engagement recognition in video datasets faces challenges from subjective labels and noise that limit model performance, requiring methods to address label uncertainty and reliability.

Method: Uses VLMs with questionnaires to extract behavioral cues and split data into high/low-reliability subsets, then applies curriculum learning with soft label refinement to gradually incorporate ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision for uncertainty.

Conclusion: Classical CV models trained on refined high-reliability subsets with curriculum strategy show improvements, demonstrating benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF approaches treat planning and execution separately, address variants ad hoc, and lack explicit uncertainty modeling, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Introduces MAPF system formal model and FICO algorithm - a factorization-based approach inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for closed-loop operation.

Result: Enables real-time execution (millisecond response), scales to thousands of agents, reduces computation time by up to 100x vs baselines, and achieves higher throughput under stochastic delays and arrivals.

Conclusion: Establishes principled foundation for MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design, enabling practical deployment with uncertainty handling.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

Conclusion: LIO-MARS provides a robust and accurate LiDAR-inertial odometry solution with optimized computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation applications.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

TL;DR: STAR is a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions for spatiotemporal object retrieval in dynamic environments, outperforming existing scene-graph and memory-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Service robots need to retrieve objects in dynamic environments using various query types (attributes, spatial context, past states), but existing approaches only handle parts of this problem - scene graphs ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods lack embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs remain closed-world.

Method: STAR uses non-parametric long-term memory and working memory for efficient recall, and employs a vision-language model to select temporal or spatial actions at each step within a unified decision loop.

Result: Experiments on STARBench benchmark and Tiago robot show STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines in spatiotemporal object search tasks.

Conclusion: Treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem provides significant benefits for object retrieval in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments.

*Jaskirat Singh,Rohan Chandra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FACA is a fair and agile collision avoidance approach for multi-robot systems that uses natural language communication and a novel potential field algorithm to create automatic "roundabout" effects for conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot systems in critical applications need to navigate constrained spaces at high speeds while dealing with multiple heterogeneous agents with changing priorities, requiring both safety and agility.

Method: Robots coordinate via natural language communication and use a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates automatic "roundabout" effects when conflicts arise.

Result: FACA achieves 3.5X faster mission completion than baselines with over 70% time reduction while maintaining robust safety margins.

Conclusion: FACA successfully balances safety with agility in multi-robot navigation through constrained spaces, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for UAV-UGV cooperative navigation that uses risk-triggered aerial re-scanning to reduce uncertainty and maintain safety in dynamic construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation approaches rely on static BIM priors or limited onboard perception, which are insufficient for dynamic construction environments where conditions change frequently.

Method: Continuous fusion of real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain evolving 2D occupancy maps, with autonomous UAV re-scanning triggered when unified corridor-risk metric exceeds safety thresholds.

Result: Risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4m. Achieves similar uncertainty reduction as frontier-based exploration in half the mission time.

Conclusion: Integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics, providing significant improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

TL;DR: AsyncVLA is a vision-language-action model that introduces asynchronous flow matching with temporal flexibility and self-correction capabilities, outperforming traditional synchronous approaches in long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLA models using synchronous flow matching (SFM) suffer from rigid time schedules and lack action context awareness, making them unstable in long-horizon tasks where single action errors can cascade into failure.

Method: Proposes asynchronous flow matching (AFM) that generates action tokens in non-uniform time schedules with action context awareness. Introduces a confidence rater to extract confidence of generated actions and selectively refine inaccurate tokens before execution. Uses unified training for both SFM and AFM modes in a single model.

Result: Extensive experiments show AsyncVLA is data-efficient with self-correction ability, achieving state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM.

Conclusion: AsyncVLA's asynchronous flow matching framework with temporal flexibility and self-correction capabilities provides a more robust approach for VLA models in long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

*Felipe Ballen-Moreno,Pasquale Ferrentino,Milan Amighi,Bram Vanderborght,Tom Verstraten*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-variable characterization method for wearable robot cuffs that considers both normal and tangential forces, addressing limitations of single-variable approaches in capturing multi-degree-of-freedom interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current characterization methods for wearable robot cuffs rely on single fitting variables along one degree of freedom, which limits applicability since interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom and complex soft tissue behavior.

Method: The authors developed a dual-variable characterization method involving both normal and tangential forces to identify reliable material parameters and evaluate the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses.

Result: The method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into characterization by analyzing normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models.

Conclusion: The dual-variable approach provides a foundation for more accurate simulation of the physical interaction between wearable robots and human limbs, enabling better understanding of pressure distribution and shear stress in cuff design.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

TL;DR: MA-SLAM is a Map-Aware Active SLAM system using Deep Reinforcement Learning that improves exploration efficiency in large-scale environments through structured map representation and global path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Active SLAM methods work well in small controlled environments but struggle with large-scale diverse environments due to long exploration times and suboptimal paths.

Method: Proposes a novel structured map representation by discretizing spatial data and integrating boundary points with historical trajectory. Uses DRL-based decision module with global planner for long-range target optimization instead of sequential action prediction.

Result: Experiments in three simulation environments and real UGV deployment show significant reduction in both exploration duration and distance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MA-SLAM effectively addresses efficient exploration challenges in large-scale environments through structured map representation and global path planning with DRL.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Achieved 8.0% average relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests confirmed generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Conclusion: CCoL successfully overcomes semantic-physical misalignment and generates robust, smooth action execution trajectories, demonstrating superior performance in language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Result: Demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations including sensor noise and object dynamics changes. Achieves high success rates with only 6,000 online interactions on real robot.

Conclusion: MSDP provides a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control, offering strong robustness and efficient learning in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial robotic systems face severe consequences from failures, but traditional mutation testing operators are poorly suited for robotic programs involving message-based commands and physical interactions.

Method: Proposed domain-specific mutation operators at high-level read/write operations including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection, with empirical evaluation on a pick-and-place scenario.

Result: The approach produces more informative mutants and reduces invalid/equivalent cases compared to conventional operators, demonstrating improved test suite evaluation effectiveness.

Conclusion: Mutation testing with domain-specific operators can enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

Result: Successfully demonstrated with a robot arm performing movement tasks while avoiding obstacles, showing the policy maintains safety without compromising task performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively transforms unsafe policies into safe ones with formal guarantees and can be extended to complex specifications and dynamic environments.

Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

Conclusion: The presented robotic platform successfully overcomes challenges in open cavity MIS by providing enhanced dexterity, control, and surgical awareness, particularly for complex procedures like fetoscopic laser coagulation.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

TL;DR: An automated firefighting assistance system using UAVs for fire detection and localization, combined with motorized fire monitors for precise water jet targeting in industrial facilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial fires present challenges due to large building sizes, visual obstructions, and inaccurate fire location assessments, leading to increased damage and prolonged firefighting operations.

Method: UAV autonomously flies in obstacle-free flight funnels to detect and localize heat sources. Operator selects targets, then UAV triangulates fire positions while system automatically steers fire monitor to direct water jets.

Result: Preliminary tests showed successful localization of multiple heat sources and accurate water jet direction towards fires.

Conclusion: The automated assistance system effectively addresses industrial firefighting challenges by combining UAV-based fire detection with automated water targeting.

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

### [157] [Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14565)
*Minyoung Hwang,Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Nathaniel Dennler,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Masked IRL combines language instructions with demonstrations to learn reward functions more efficiently, using LLMs to infer state-relevance masks and handle ambiguous instructions, achieving better generalization with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward learning from demonstrations often overfits to spurious correlations due to limited data, while language instructions can specify what matters but are often treated as simple conditioning signals without fully resolving ambiguity.

Method: Proposes Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL) that uses LLMs to infer state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, LLMs clarify them in the context of demonstrations.

Result: Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data in both simulation and real robot experiments, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Conclusion: Combining demonstrations and language instructions through LLM reasoning enables more effective reward learning by leveraging complementary information - demonstrations show how to act while language specifies what is important.

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs show promise for autonomous driving but their safety-critical performance is unexplored, creating safety concerns due to lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external and in-cabin safety simultaneously.

Method: Developed DSBench benchmark with 10 key categories and 28 sub-categories covering external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety. Constructed a 98K instance dataset for fine-tuning VLMs on safety scenarios.

Result: Extensive evaluations show significant performance degradation of mainstream VLMs in complex safety-critical situations. Fine-tuning on the safety dataset significantly enhances VLM safety performance.

Conclusion: DSBench addresses critical safety gaps in VLM applications for autonomous driving, provides comprehensive evaluation framework, and demonstrates that targeted fine-tuning can substantially improve safety performance, advancing autonomous driving technology.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Gallant is a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion using LiDAR data and end-to-end optimization, enabling navigation in complex 3D environments like stairs and narrow passages with near 100% success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception methods for humanoid locomotion (depth images, elevation maps) provide only partial, flattened views of environments, failing to capture full 3D structure needed for robust navigation in constrained terrains.

Method: Uses voxelized LiDAR data as perceptual representation with z-grouped 2D CNN mapping to control policy, supported by high-fidelity LiDAR simulation for scalable training and sim-to-real consistency.

Result: Achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios like stair climbing and elevated platforms, with broader perceptual coverage enabling navigation through lateral clutter, overhead constraints, and multi-level structures.

Conclusion: Gallant demonstrates superior performance over previous methods by providing comprehensive 3D environmental perception and end-to-end optimization, enabling robust humanoid locomotion in complex constrained terrains.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NORA-1.5 is an enhanced VLA model that adds flow-matching-based action expert to NORA backbone, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It further improves robustness through reward-driven post-training using action-conditioned world models and deviation heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack reliability and generalization across different embodiments and real-world environments, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Enhanced NORA backbone with flow-matching action expert, then used reward models (action-conditioned world model + deviation heuristic) to create preference datasets for DPO-based post-training adaptation.

Result: Outperforms NORA and state-of-the-art VLA models across simulated and real-world benchmarks, with reward-driven post-training consistently improving performance in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training provide a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment, demonstrating significant VLA model reliability gains.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

*Albert Lin,Alessandro Pinto,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoVer-CoRe is a framework for robust verification of perception-based controllers using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, addressing safety verification under perceptual uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perception-based controllers for autonomous systems need formal safety verification despite perceptual uncertainty, but current verification methods are limited by controller complexity or result in conservative analyses.

Method: Concatenate system controller, observation function, and state estimation modules to create an equivalent closed-loop system compatible with existing HJ reachability frameworks, enabling formal safety verification and robust controller design.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation, showing the framework's practical applicability.

Conclusion: RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for verifying perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty, providing a novel approach to safety verification and robust controller design.

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

Motivation: Real-world robot demonstrations face challenges with complex interaction dynamics, where purely positional controllers struggle with contacts and varying payloads.

Result: Experiments on real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks like compliant table wiping and drawer opening.

Conclusion: HMC framework effectively addresses complex real-world manipulation by adaptively combining multiple control modalities, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advanced VLMs like DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at logical reasoning but struggle with fundamental spatial reasoning tasks involving mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension.

Method: Introduces SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark to measure spatial reasoning accuracy and efficiency, and proposes an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training to build internal world models.

Result: Three key findings: 1) VLMs rely heavily on linguistic representations, failing at visual-centric spatial tasks; 2) VLMs show severe inefficiency with token usage growing rapidly with complexity; 3) IDF can implicitly construct internal world models for better spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The work identifies spatial reasoning limitations in advanced VLMs, reveals their linguistic bias and inefficiency patterns, and provides a framework (IDF) to guide future improvements in building spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

TL;DR: KANGURA is a novel 3D machine learning framework that uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for geometry-aware learning with unified attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both benchmark datasets and real-world MFC anode structure optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive models struggle to capture complex geometric dependencies needed to optimize microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode structures, which are crucial for sustainable energy generation performance.

Method: KANGURA formulates prediction as function decomposition using KAN-based representation learning without conventional MLPs, employs geometry-disentangled representation learning to separate structural variations, and uses unified attention mechanisms to enhance critical geometric regions.

Result: Outperforms 15+ SOTA models on ModelNet40 with 92.7% accuracy, and achieves 97% accuracy in real-world MFC anode structure optimization problems.

Conclusion: KANGURA establishes a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, enabling new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

*Humza Nusrat,Omar Nusrat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, was evaluated on three radiation biology hypotheses using random-gene null benchmarks, producing one well-supported discovery, one uncertain result, and one false hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capability of agentic AI scientists like KOSMOS in generating and testing scientific hypotheses in radiation biology, and assess their performance against appropriate null models.

Method: Used simple random-gene null benchmarks to test three specific hypotheses: DDR capacity predicting p53 response, OGT/CDO1 predicting radiation-response modules, and a 12-gene signature predicting prostate cancer recurrence after radiotherapy.

Result: Hypothesis 1 was unsupported (DDR-p53 correlation: rho=-0.40, p=0.76). Hypothesis 2 showed weak association for OGT (r=0.23, p=0.34) but strong for CDO1 (r=0.70, p=0.0039). Hypothesis 3 achieved modest predictive power (C-index=0.61, p=0.017) but non-unique effect size.

Conclusion: AI scientists can generate useful scientific ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models, as they can produce both valid discoveries and false hypotheses.

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Markovian models in representing confounding relationships and extend the methodology to more general semi-Markovian SCMs that can capture real-world confounding scenarios.

Method: Investigated challenges of extending the divide-and-conquer approach to semi-Markovian models using a minimal example, developed alternative solution strategies, and evaluated them theoretically and computationally.

Result: Identified specific challenges in extending the methodology and proposed alternative strategies for handling semi-Markovian models with shared exogenous variables across multiple endogenous variables.

Conclusion: Successfully extended the counterfactual probability bounding approach to semi-Markovian SCMs, providing methods to handle confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot represent.

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are widely used in ITS applications but are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, posing serious security risks in transportation systems.

Method: Constructed a transportation-specific harmful query dataset, developed a novel jailbreaking attack combining image typography manipulation with multi-turn prompting, and created a multi-layered response filtering defense technique.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LVLMs showed severe security vulnerabilities, with GPT-4 and manual verification confirming the effectiveness of the proposed attack method.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical security risks in LVLMs integrated in ITS and demonstrates that image typography manipulation combined with multi-turn prompting poses significant jailbreaking threats that require robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [168] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI is a new pattern-matching algorithm that provides quadratic time/space guarantees for finding matches, addressing exponential complexity issues in rule-based systems by using a two-step graph approach instead of traditional RETE β-memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based systems face exponential time/space complexity when matching rules with many underconstrained variables, especially when AI systems automatically generate rules through induction or synthesis, causing memory overflows and execution halts.

Method: CORGI uses a two-step approach: 1) build/maintain a graph of grounded relations in a forward pass, 2) iterators generate matches by working backward through the graph, eliminating traditional β-memory and enabling streaming of matches without full conflict sets.

Result: Performance evaluation shows CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on combinatorial matching tasks, avoiding high-latency delays and memory overflows.

Conclusion: CORGI makes rule-based systems practical for real-time applications by providing predictable performance guarantees and eliminating the memory explosion problems of traditional pattern-matching approaches.

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scene graph-guided generative AI framework synthesizes photorealistic workplace hazard images from OSHA accident reports using GPT-4o for hazard reasoning extraction and diffusion models for image generation, with a novel VQA-based evaluation metric outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision models for workplace hazard detection requires realistic images of unsafe conditions, but capturing actual accident-triggering scenarios is nearly impossible, creating a data acquisition challenge.

Method: OSHA accident reports are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, converted into object-level scene graphs that guide text-to-image diffusion models to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. A VQA framework evaluates realism and semantic fidelity.

Result: The proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics across four state-of-the-art generative models based on entropy-based validation, demonstrating higher discriminative sensitivity for evaluating generated hazard images.

Conclusion: The scene graph-guided generative framework successfully synthesizes realistic workplace hazard images from textual accident reports, with the novel VQA evaluation metric providing superior assessment of semantic fidelity compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Conclusion: ALEX presents a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems by fundamentally improving retrieval efficiency and handling of complex multi-hop questions.

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS is an LLM-based framework that generates synthetic triage cases for mass casualty incidents, achieving quality comparable to manually curated datasets and enabling stable AI model development for emergency medical situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents require effective triage but occur infrequently, making real-world data collection challenging. AI development for such scenarios needs sufficient benchmark datasets that are difficult to obtain from actual incidents.

Method: Developed Syn-STARTS framework using Large Language Models to generate synthetic triage cases, then compared quality against manually curated TRIAGE dataset using standard START triage categories (green, yellow, red, black).

Result: Generated triage cases were qualitatively indistinguishable from manually curated data. LLM accuracy evaluation across hundreds of cases in all four triage categories showed highly stable performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using LLMs shows strong potential for developing high-performance AI models in critical medical situations where real-world data is scarce, particularly for mass casualty incident triage systems.

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an integrated multi-agent system for scientific and engineering workflows that emphasizes transparency, provenance tracking, and adaptability to evolving scientific corpora.

Method: Uses Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow with optional Evaluator, prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph, hybrid memory (FAISS + SQLite), incremental indexing based on file hashing, and configuration-driven project bootstrap.

Result: Successfully applied to multiple research areas at Argonne National Laboratory including waste-to-products research, energy process safety, and general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: AISAC provides a flexible, transparent multi-agent framework for scientific workflows that can adapt to evolving research needs while maintaining full provenance tracking and decision transparency.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an instructor-governed adaptive learning system with three safeguards (adequacy, attention, diversity) that converts concept-level assessments into vetted micro-interventions using optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem that adaptive learning often provides weak interventions that are mistimed or misaligned despite precise diagnosis, aiming to close the diagnostic-pedagogical loop.

Method: Formalizes intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows, prerequisites, and anti-redundancy. Uses greedy selection for low-richness scenarios, gradient-based relaxation for rich repositories, and a hybrid method.

Result: In deployment with 1,204 physics students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage within bounded watch time. Gradient-based method reduced redundancy by ~12% vs greedy while harmonizing difficulty, while greedy provided comparable adequacy with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The system provides a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper models how networks of LLMs collaboratively answer questions, analyzing how hallucinations spread through interactions. Using mean-field dynamics and randomized utility models, it studies conditions for stable truthful behavior and experimentally validates findings on 100 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate when evidence is lacking, and these effects amplify in networks where hallucinations can spread, causing previously accurate models to become unreliable. Understanding this collaborative hallucination phenomenon is crucial for reliable multi-agent AI systems.

Method: Combines mean-field dynamics from network science with randomized utility models from economics to create a generative model. Models LLMs with latent truthfulness states, analyzes fixed points in directed networks, and experimentally tests on 100 open-source LLMs across various network conditions.

Result: Establishes sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of fixed points in LLM networks, analyzes how incentives affect behavior, and experimentally validates the model's predictions regarding data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and framing sensitivity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully models hallucination spread in LLM networks, providing analytical tools to understand and potentially mitigate collaborative misinformation while highlighting the importance of network structure and incentives in maintaining truthful behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APD-agents is an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates mobile app page layout design by dynamically coordinating specialized agents to parse user descriptions, generate layouts, retrieve templates, and recursively create fine-grained components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile app layout design is time-consuming and requires extensive training with design software, while collaborative design across pages demands additional effort for consistency. The authors aim to automate this process using AI.

Method: A multi-agent framework with OrchestratorAgent (coordinates tasks), SemanticParserAgent (converts descriptions to structured data), PrimaryLayoutAgent (generates coarse layouts), TemplateRetrievalAgent (fetches relevant examples), and RecursiveComponentAgent (creates fine-grained sub-elements).

Result: Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in automated page design.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration to automate mobile app page design, demonstrating effective performance through specialized agent coordination.

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial information retrieval from lengthy filings is critical for operational and analytical decision-making, requiring effective extraction of task-relevant information.

Method: PRISM integrates three components: refined system prompting for precise instructions, in-context learning for relevant few-shot examples, and a lightweight multi-agent system for coordinated scoring behavior.

Result: Achieves NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on restricted validation split, demonstrating feasibility and robustness for production-scale financial retrieval.

Conclusion: PRISM's modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world financial retrieval applications without requiring model training.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

TL;DR: R3 is a dual-process framework that combines lightweight VLN experts with powerful multimodal LLMs for vision-and-language navigation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with real-world spatial understanding in VLN tasks and have high computational costs, creating a performance gap with domain experts despite their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-module framework: Runner (lightweight transformer expert for efficient navigation), Ruminator (multimodal LLM with chain-of-thought reasoning), and Regulator (controls thinking mode switching based on navigation progress).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.28% SPL and 3.30% RGSPL on REVERIE benchmark in zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: The dual-process framework effectively integrates LLM generalization with domain expertise, providing efficient and accurate navigation while handling challenging VLN tasks.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks focus only on task completion accuracy, ignoring critical enterprise requirements like cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability.

Method: Proposed CLEAR framework with systematic analysis of 12 benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents on 300 enterprise tasks.

Result: Accuracy-only optimization yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives; CLEAR better predicts production success (ρ=0.83) vs accuracy-only (ρ=0.41).

Conclusion: CLEAR provides a holistic evaluation framework essential for enterprise AI deployment, addressing cost variations, reliability drops, and missing multidimensional metrics.

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Motivation: Traditional centralized ML struggles with distributed data and privacy in 5G/IoT networks, while existing federated learning has high costs and poor generalization for network traffic classification.

Method: Proposed HFL-FlowLLM framework that applies large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning environments.

Result: Achieved 13% improvement in average F1 score over SOTA methods, and with increasing clients, achieved 5% F1 improvement while reducing training costs by 87% compared to existing LLM federated learning frameworks.

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM demonstrates strong potential and practical value for network security in modern communication networks, offering compelling performance and robustness.

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [181] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with chronological reasoning tasks, particularly as sequence length increases, but explicit reasoning allocation (especially in GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking) significantly improves performance on ordering, conditional sorting, and anachronism detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs truly understand chronology, which is crucial for their application in finance and economics where look-ahead bias must be avoided.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet (with/without Extended Thinking), and GPT-5 on three chronological tasks: chronological ordering, conditional sorting (filter then order), and anachronism detection across multiple reasoning-effort settings.

Result: Exact match rates drop sharply with longer sequences, though rank correlations remain high. Conditional sorting failures mainly occur during filtering. GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outperform other models, with GPT-5 achieving flawless ordering at medium/high reasoning effort.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in chronological reasoning, but explicit reasoning allocation helps significantly, especially for complex tasks. These findings are important for real-time financial applications of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

*Kumud Tripathi,Aditya Srinivas Menon,Aman Gaurav,Raj Prakash Gohil,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage architecture combining Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and multi-objective knowledge distillation to reduce hallucinations in Whisper ASR under noisy conditions while maintaining clean speech performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper ASR suffers from hallucination errors in noisy environments, and previous approaches focused on preprocessing/post-processing rather than modifying the model itself to directly address hallucinations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) ALA groups encoder layers into semantic blocks and fuses them via multi-head attention for robust encoding; 2) Multi-objective KD trains student on noisy audio to match teacher's semantic/attention distributions from clean inputs.

Result: Significant reduction in hallucinations and word error rates on noisy speech benchmarks, while preserving performance on clean speech.

Conclusion: ALA and KD provide a principled strategy to enhance Whisper's reliability in real-world noisy conditions by directly modifying the model architecture.

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel time-series framework predicts Airbnb market trends (Revenue, Reservation Days, Number of Reservations) 1-3 months ahead using LLM-generated regional embeddings and advanced time-series models, achieving 48% lower error than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb expansion disrupts local housing markets, increasing rental prices and affordability issues. Accurate forecasting helps policymakers mitigate these impacts.

Method: Sliding-window approach with regional representations integrating listing features, urban accessibility, and human mobility. Converts tabular data to LLM prompts for embeddings, then uses RNN/LSTM/Transformer models for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Result: 48% reduction in average RMSE and MAE compared to traditional statistical and machine learning baselines on Seoul's Airbnb dataset.

Conclusion: Framework improves forecasting accuracy and provides practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

*Yu Liu,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Yangxi Li,Shi Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind is a novel framework that enhances knowledge graph reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths using a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm with semantic-aware path prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGR methods face two limitations: indiscriminate path extraction that introduces irrelevant noise, and high computational demands from frequent LLM calls during dynamic path exploration.

Method: Follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm: retrieves query subgraph, prioritizes paths using semantic-aware function considering both accumulated and future costs, and generates responses via dual-phase training (instruction tuning + path-wise preference alignment).

Result: Extensive experiments show PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, especially on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Conclusion: PathMind effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based KGR methods by providing faithful and interpretable reasoning through selective path guidance, demonstrating superior performance particularly in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data insight agents have limitations including insufficient domain knowledge utilization, shallow analytical depth, and error-prone code generation, which prevent them from delivering satisfactory automated insight discovery results.

Method: Proposed DataSage framework with three key features: external knowledge retrieval to enrich analytical context, multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives, and multi-path reasoning to improve code and insight accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on InsightBench show DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: DataSage provides an effective solution for automated data insight discovery by addressing key limitations of current approaches through its multi-agent framework with enhanced knowledge utilization and analytical depth.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

### [187] [When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14334)
*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate executable optimization models from natural language descriptions, but their apparent success may stem from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning, as performance drops significantly when problems are rephrased or perturbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' ability to generate optimization models comes from genuine reasoning or data contamination, since many standard constraint programming problems are likely in their training data.

Method: Systematically rephrased and perturbed well-known CSPLib problems to preserve structure while changing context and adding misleading elements, then compared model generation performance across original and modified descriptions using three representative LLMs.

Result: LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, but performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate limited genuine reasoning capabilities for optimization model generation, showing sensitivity to surface-level changes that suggests their success on standard benchmarks may be due to data contamination rather than deep understanding.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

*Dalia Ali,Dora Zhao,Allison Koenecke,Orestis Papakyriakopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how incorporating pluralistic human values affects LLM alignment, finding systematic demographic variations in safety ratings and showing that technical design choices significantly impact model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment often overlooks human social diversity, focusing on homogeneous values rather than incorporating pluralistic perspectives from different demographic groups.

Method: Collected alignment data from 1,095 US and German participants (27,375 ratings) across five dimensions, fine-tuned multiple LLMs using group-specific preferences while varying rating scales, disagreement handling, and optimization techniques.

Result: Found systematic demographic effects (e.g., male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than females), and technical choices showed strong impacts - preserving rater disagreement achieved 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded 22% more reduction than binary formats.

Conclusion: The findings represent a preliminary step toward understanding how alignment should balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation across diverse social groups.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that bridges continuous perception and discrete symbolic reasoning by modeling and propagating uncertainty from visual observations to planning, achieving high success rates in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of connecting continuous perceptual signals with discrete symbolic reasoning under uncertainty in AI systems.

Method: Couples transformer-based perceptual front-end with GNN relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states, combined with uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low.

Result: Processed 10,047 PyBullet scenes with F1=0.68 for predicate extraction; achieved 94%/90%/88% success on robotic manipulation benchmarks (90.7% average), exceeding POMDP baselines by 10-14 points with 15ms planning time.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled connection between perception and planning with theoretical guarantees linking calibrated uncertainty to planning convergence, applicable to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting unstructured educational materials like lecture notes into task-oriented knowledge graphs that capture key pedagogical content remains challenging, limiting the effectiveness of AI-powered learning systems.

Method: Model lecture content as metric-measure space, align candidate KGs using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to quantify semantic distortion, and apply refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) to minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian.

Result: Applied to data science lectures, the method yields interpretable rate-distortion curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education, enabling automatic generation of high-quality educational content.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

*Jingyi Jia,Qinbin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTool is a graph-based framework that reduces LLM agent inference costs by 30% by modeling tool usage inertia from historical trajectories, eliminating repeated LLM calls for tool selection while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent frameworks like ReAct suffer from high inference costs due to repeated LLM invocations for tool selection at each step, creating a major bottleneck for practical deployment.

Method: Constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, modeling tool usage inertia. Integrates parameter-level information for tool input generation and traverses this graph to select tools with minimal LLM inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates across diverse agent tasks.

Conclusion: AutoTool demonstrates the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance, offering a practical enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

*Ruomeng Ding,Wei Cheng,Minglai Shao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillGen is a skill-based in-context learning framework that improves LLM performance in sequential decision-making by creating action-centric graphs, identifying high-utility actions, and generating fine-grained prompts without heavy expert annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods for LLMs in sequential decision-making are sensitive to prompt quality and often fail to simultaneously address three key principles: focusing on decision-critical information, providing step-level granularity, and minimizing expert annotation requirements.

Method: SkillGen constructs an action-centric domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions using temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts.

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld with both open-source and proprietary LLMs show SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

Conclusion: SkillGen effectively addresses the limitations of existing ICL methods by focusing on high-utility segments, which supports task identifiability and enables more effective prompt design for sequential decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

*Parya Dolatyabi,Mahdi Khodayar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper applies Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) with HAPPO to coordinate power distribution system restoration across interconnected microgrids, achieving better performance than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches are computationally inefficient and difficult to scale for power distribution system restoration due to sequential switching operations, nonlinear constraints, and coordination challenges.

Method: Uses Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) with decentralized actor policies and centralized critic, trained in a physics-informed OpenDSS environment that enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals.

Result: HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX on IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex power distribution system restoration.

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.
