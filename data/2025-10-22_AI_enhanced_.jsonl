The Strategist\ndynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles\nthem into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to\nenhance the Attacker's effectiveness.

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning.
