Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations.

Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies.

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken.

In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics.

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps.

This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adding explicit spatial relations to 3D scene graphs improves LLMs' ability to ground objects from natural language commands, with open-vocabulary VLM-generated relations showing limited advantage over closed-vocabulary ones.", "motivation": "Robots need to understand natural language commands in human environments, requiring task inference, action decomposition, and grounding in environmental knowledge.

However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead.

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS.

State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \\method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.
