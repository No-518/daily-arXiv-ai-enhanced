### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training improves text-to-image generation by routing confounding factors through auxiliary modules during training, then removing them during inference to achieve better disentanglement and prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapter-based training for image generators often entangles target attributes with incidental factors like pose, expression, and lighting, limiting generalization and prompt adherence.

Method: Provide shortcuts for confounding factors through auxiliary modules (ControlNet or LoRA) during adapter training, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them, then remove auxiliary modules during inference.

Result: When applied to facial and full-body identity injection, the approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Establishing shortcuts for what should NOT be learned is an effective design principle for achieving disentangled representations in large models.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) introduces a new paradigm for semantic video control using reference videos as prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that prevents catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for semantic video control either introduce artifacts through pixel-wise priors or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning, creating a need for unified, generalizable approaches.

Method: VAP uses reference videos as semantic prompts to guide a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers expert with temporally biased position embedding for robust context retrieval.

Result: VAP achieves 38.7% user preference rate, rivaling leading condition-specific commercial models, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across various applications.

Conclusion: VAP represents a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation with its unified approach and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net combines CNNs and transformers with focal modulation attention and bidirectional feature fusion to improve medical image segmentation by capturing global context and enhancing boundary precision across various lesion types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but CNNs struggle with capturing global context and long-range dependencies, limiting their ability to segment complex structures with varying sizes and borders.

Method: Proposes FM-BFF-Net that integrates convolutional and transformer components, uses focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces bidirectional feature fusion module for efficient encoder-decoder interaction across scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets (polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, ultrasound imaging) show FM-BFF-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net effectively enhances boundary precision and robustness to lesion variations, demonstrating strong adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT is a generative framework for multi-modal point tracking that captures trajectory uncertainty through flow matching, outperforming discriminative models on occluded points while maintaining competitive visible point tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative point trackers fail to capture multi-modality in trajectories and regress to mean/mode estimates under uncertainty from occlusions and appearance changes.

Method: Uses flow matching with iterative refinement, window-dependent prior for consistency, and coordinate-specific variance schedule. Employs best-first search on generated samples during inference guided by model confidence.

Result: State-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points in TAP-Vid with added occlusions, competitive performance on visible points across PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks.

Conclusion: Generative modeling effectively captures multi-modality in point trajectories, significantly improving occluded point tracking while maintaining visible point tracking performance.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee is the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, providing 494k high-quality quintuples from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes with diagnostic questions, 3D bounding boxes, clinician reasoning steps, and severity assessments to address VLMs' limitations in anatomical grounding and step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle to ground anatomical regions in 3D medical images and reason step-by-step, which is essential for aligning with clinical diagnostic workflows and enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets lack support for this "grounded reasoning" ability.

Method: Created 3DReasonKnee dataset with 494k quintuples from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes, each containing: 3D MRI volume, diagnostic question, 3D bounding box, clinician-generated reasoning steps, and structured severity assessments. Involved 450+ hours of expert clinician time for manual segmentation and reasoning chain generation.

Result: Established ReasonKnee-Bench for evaluating localization and diagnostic accuracy, providing insights into VLM grounding and severity assessment capabilities. Benchmarked five state-of-the-art VLMs to provide baseline performance metrics for the benchmark.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities, addressing the gap in grounded reasoning for 3D medical images.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a 3D reconstruction method that is robust to illumination variations and material properties, addressing limitations of existing techniques that struggle with transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects.

Method: Uses multi-view thermal polarimetric imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum, formulating a general theory of polarization observation that eliminates ambiguities present in visible light polarization analysis.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs fine details in challenging objects including transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous materials, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Thermal polarization-based 3D reconstruction provides a robust alternative to conventional methods, enabling detailed shape recovery regardless of illumination conditions and material properties.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA introduces a self-supervised fine-tuning method for vision foundation models that adapts them to new domains using only multi-view object-centric videos without requiring annotations, preventing knowledge forgetting through careful parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels where supervised fine-tuning is infeasible, and existing self-supervised adaptation methods haven't worked well for vision encoder models.

Method: Uses self-distillation paradigm with multi-view object-centric videos, carefully tuning prediction heads and deploying parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to prevent forgetting pretrained knowledge.

Result: VESSA consistently improves downstream classification performance across 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets compared to base models and previous adaptation methods.

Conclusion: The method enables effective domain adaptation for vision foundation models without annotations, learning robustness to varied capture conditions through multi-view object observations.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings that enhances detection accuracy by reducing domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation pipelines degrade under challenging industrial conditions like clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck.

Method: Uses low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with foundation models to suppress false positives in raw SAM outputs, providing more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP demonstrate significant boost in detection accuracy with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows effectiveness and practicality for improving 2D detection in industrial environments, addressing key challenges in 6D pose estimation pipelines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [9] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for automated structural damage assessment using image data from the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes, focusing on detecting exposed steel reinforcement in concrete structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely assessment of structural integrity after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response. The study aims to automate damage detection using exposed steel reinforcement as an indicator of structural damage.

Method: Developed a hybrid deep learning framework using YOLOv11 models for damage detection. Created labeled datasets from 2023 Turkey Earthquake images, employed fine-tuning and data augmentation. The framework includes classification for building locations/structural components, detection of cracking/spalling/exposed bars, and damage level categorization.

Result: The research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts through the proposed deep learning approach.

Conclusion: The study successfully shows that automated structural damage assessment using image data and deep learning methods is feasible and reliable for post-earthquake emergency response.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D is a zero-shot framework that generates 3D scene graphs by leveraging pretrained foundation models for open-vocabulary recognition, enabling incremental updates and geometric grounding without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene graph generation methods are limited to single-view settings, lack incremental update capability, and have no explicit geometric grounding, which are essential for embodied robotics applications.

Method: Uses VLM reasoning to generate rich 2D scene graphs, then grounds them in 3D using depth information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial/semantic relations with inter-object distances.

Result: Experiments on Replica and HM3D datasets show ZING-3D effectively captures spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training.

Conclusion: ZING-3D provides a zero-shot solution for generating geometrically grounded 3D scene graphs with incremental update capability, making it suitable for robotics applications.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [11] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg is a novel decoder architecture for semantic segmentation that jointly optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains using wavelet frequency priors and Mamba-based attention to enhance boundary details while preserving semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic segmentation networks rely on powerful pretrained encoders but use simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation.

Method: Proposes WaveSeg decoder with: 1) Learning high-frequency components as explicit priors for boundary details, 2) Dual Domain Operation (DDO) for multi-scale fusion, 3) Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) using Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling, 4) Reparameterized convolutions for low-frequency semantic preservation, and 5) Residual-guided fusion for multi-scale feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show WaveSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Conclusion: WaveSeg demonstrates that leveraging wavelet-domain frequency priors with Mamba-based attention enables superior semantic segmentation performance by effectively balancing semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

### [12] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrating expert-derived textual concepts with vision-language models for Hirschsprung's disease classification, outperforming CNN-based models with 83.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis are black boxes that don't align with physician decision-making processes and lack clinical interpretability.

Method: Integrates expert-derived textual concepts into Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) using prompts from medical sources, encoded with QuiltNet to align semantic cues with visual features.

Result: Achieved 83.9% accuracy, 86.6% precision, and 87.6% specificity, outperforming VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 models.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning with expert knowledge integration enables more clinically relevant and interpretable histopathology models for Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistRetinex extends Retinex model to histogram domain for fast low-light image enhancement, achieving better results with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based methods are time-consuming for large-sized images, requiring a faster alternative.

Method: Extends Retinex model to histogram domain using histogram location/count matrices, constructs two-level optimization model, and uses histogram matching for enhancement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visibility and performance metrics, executes in 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 images (6.67 seconds faster than alternatives).

Conclusion: HistRetinex provides an efficient and effective solution for fast low-light image enhancement with superior performance.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Visual Reasoning (AVR), extending visual reasoning to partially observable environments where agents must actively gather information through physical actions, integrate multi-step observations, and dynamically adjust decisions based on visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to static, fully observable settings, which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where information is often incomplete due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans actively explore environments through perception-reasoning-action loops.

Method: Created CLEVR-AVR benchmark for evaluating AVR, developed AVR-152k dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations, and built PhysVLM-AVR model that handles uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Analysis shows current embodied MLLMs struggle with active information acquisition and integration.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental gap in active reasoning capabilities of current MLLMs - while they can detect information incompleteness, they fail to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, highlighting the need for active visual reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

### [15] [Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112)
*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An object-centric, uncertainty-aware pipeline for 3D city change detection using LiDAR data that handles registration errors, surface roughness, and object splits/merges while maintaining class consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D city change detection are sensitive to alignment errors, degrade thin structures, lack object identity preservation, and don't handle uncertainty or object splits/merges effectively.

Method: Multi-resolution NDT alignment followed by point-to-plane ICP, height normalization, uncertainty modeling from registration covariance and surface roughness, geometry-based cross-epoch associations refined by semantic/instance segmentation, and class-constrained bipartite assignment with dummy handling for splits/merges.

Result: Achieved 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU on 15 Subiaco blocks, outperforming Triplet KPConv with largest gains on 'Decreased' category where IoU improved by 7.6 points to 74.8%.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware, object-centric approach effectively handles registration errors, sampling variations, and complex object relationships while maintaining high accuracy and class consistency in large-scale urban change detection.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

*Yanguang Sun,Jiawei Lian,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Controllable-LPMoE is a novel fine-tuning paradigm that uses dynamic local priors to efficiently adapt large foundation models for segmentation tasks with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-parameter fine-tuning of large foundation models for segmentation tasks causes significant computational overhead, while existing prompt-based methods lack semantic priors, limiting model adaptability.

Method: Uses a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor with heterogeneous convolutions to capture diverse local priors, a gating network to select expert priors, and a bi-directional interaction adapter with cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods and adaptability to multiple binary object segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE provides an efficient fine-tuning approach that achieves excellent segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational overhead through dynamic local priors modulation.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafetyPairs is a framework for generating counterfactual image pairs that differ only in safety-relevant features, enabling fine-grained analysis of image safety and improving vision-language model evaluation and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, lacking isolation of specific features that determine safety. Subtle changes can drastically alter safety implications, but current approaches don't systematically differentiate between benign and problematic images.

Method: Leverage image editing models to make targeted changes that alter safety labels while preserving safety-irrelevant details, creating counterfactual pairs where only safety-relevant features differ.

Result: Created a benchmark with 3,020 SafetyPair images across 9 safety categories, revealing weaknesses in vision-language models' ability to distinguish subtle safety differences. The pipeline also improves sample efficiency for training lightweight guard models.

Conclusion: SafetyPairs provides the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions, serving both as an evaluation benchmark and effective data augmentation strategy for safety-focused model training.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO is a multimodal RL framework that improves Chain-of-Thought reasoning in MLLMs by injecting controlled noise into visual inputs and using Bayesian advantage estimation to enhance generalization beyond training distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks for improving general CoT reasoning in MLLMs struggle with generalization beyond training distributions, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposes NoisyGRPO with two key components: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy using Gaussian noise on visual inputs to encourage broader exploration, and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation that formulates advantage estimation as Bayesian inference, fusing noise level as prior and trajectory reward as likelihood.

Result: Experiments show NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness on CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, especially with small-scale MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO effectively addresses generalization limitations in RL-based CoT reasoning improvement by combining noise-injected exploration with principled Bayesian advantage estimation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

### [19] [Digital Contrast CT Pulmonary Angiography Synthesis from Non-contrast CT for Pulmonary Vascular Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21140)
*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, eliminating the need for iodinated contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic quality for pulmonary vascular diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA requires iodinated contrast agents that pose risks like nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, especially in high-risk patients. The study aims to develop a safer alternative by generating contrast-enhanced images from non-contrast scans.

Method: Used a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) trained on 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans from three centers, with 249 for training/validation and 161 for testing.

Result: Achieved superior performance with MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98 on test set. Downstream tasks showed improved pulmonary vessel segmentation (Dice: 0.70) and better vascular quantification (ICC: 0.81 vs 0.70 for NCCT).

Conclusion: The proposed DCCTPA method successfully generates contrast-enhanced images from non-contrast CT scans, providing a safer alternative to traditional CTPA while maintaining diagnostic quality for pulmonary vascular assessment.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIG (Spatial Intelligence Grid) is a grid-based schema that explicitly encodes spatial layouts and relations to better evaluate and enhance visual-spatial intelligence in foundation models, addressing limitations of text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating visual-spatial intelligence in foundation models rely on textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscure geometry, allow linguistic shortcuts, and fail to properly attribute spatial skills.

Method: Introduces Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) - a structured grid-based schema that encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physical priors as a complementary channel to text for representing scene structure.

Result: SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations in few-shot learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. Also releases SIGBench benchmark with 1.4K driving frames.

Conclusion: SIG shows promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning visual-spatial intelligence, providing more faithful evaluation of spatial capabilities separate from language priors.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) partitions the generative trajectory into temporal segments with specialized velocity blocks, improving efficiency and quality through semantic feature guidance and feature residual approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Flow Matching models use a single large network for the entire generative trajectory, which struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps and incurs high inference costs due to iterative model evaluation.

Method: BFM divides the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each modeled by smaller specialized velocity blocks. It introduces Semantic Feature Guidance to condition blocks on semantically rich features, and Feature Residual Approximation to preserve quality while reducing costs.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 show BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Conclusion: BFM effectively addresses the limitations of single-network Flow Matching by enabling specialized modeling of different temporal segments, significantly improving both inference efficiency and sample quality.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP is a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods that use a single textual space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based anomaly detection methods use a single textual space to align with diverse visual semantics, which hinders accurate capture of varied anomaly semantics across different objects and domains.

Method: TokenCLIP expands the token-agnostic textual space into orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assigns each visual token to a subspace combination based on semantic affinity using optimal transport, with top-k masking to sparsify the assignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP over existing methods for anomaly detection on unseen objects.

Conclusion: The proposed token-wise adaptation framework with dynamic alignment enables more accurate fine-grained anomaly learning by customizing textual subspaces for different visual tokens rather than using a single textual space.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

TL;DR: KBE is a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework that transforms static VQA benchmarks into evolving versions using graph formulation and knowledge integration to address data contamination and saturation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks for multimodal LLMs suffer from data contamination and saturation, leading to unreliable performance evaluations.

Method: Uses graph formulation to represent VQA samples, then expands static benchmarks by integrating multimodal knowledge through reconstructing questions with visual information and expanding questions with external textual knowledge.

Result: KBE alleviates data contamination and saturation risks, enables difficulty-controllable evaluation, and provides more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: KBE offers a more reliable and dynamic evaluation protocol for multimodal LLMs compared to static benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively overcomes data scarcity by leveraging simulator-generated demonstrations, enabling efficient learning of physics-consistent world models for deformable objects with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel

enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256×256 demonstrate substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut models viable and competitive.

Conclusion: The iSM framework systematically resolves the core limitations of shortcut models, establishing them as a competitive class of generative models with improved performance across different sampling modes.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack is a multiscale adaptive system for nighttime UAV tracking that addresses challenges like low-light conditions and cluttered backgrounds through three core modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges including low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and viewpoint changes that cause existing trackers to fail. Current solutions like low-light enhancement introduce artifacts, while domain adaptation methods are computationally expensive.

Method: MATrack uses three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) for feature consistency between static/dynamic templates, Adaptive Key Token Gate to identify objects in complex backgrounds, and Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) for stable long-sequence tracking.

Result: On UAVDark135 benchmark, MATrack achieves 5.9% precision, 5.4% normalized precision, and 4.2% AUC improvements over SOTA methods, while maintaining 81 FPS real-time processing. Real-world UAV tests validate reliability for critical applications.

Conclusion: MATrack provides stable and effective nighttime UAV tracking support for critical robotics applications like search and rescue and border patrol, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai,Yaqing Zhang,Chuangjian Cai,Yan Pan Kun Yue,Jian Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSSR is a novel method using Discrete Diffusion Models to generate high-quality 3D artist-style meshes with parallel generation capability, achieving up to 10,000 faces at 1024^3 resolution through decoupled training, improved architecture, and topological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, which provides significant advantages over sequential autoregressive methods by allowing the model to see all mesh tokens concurrently for better efficiency and control.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference separating DDM-based generation into topology sculpting and shape refinement stages; 2) Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings; 3) Novel Connection Loss as topological constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at remarkable spatial resolution of 1024^3.

Conclusion: TSSR successfully introduces a parallel generation approach for 3D mesh creation using Discrete Diffusion Models, with the method showing promising results in generating complex, high-resolution artist-style meshes through its innovative decoupled architecture and topological constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE-3D upgrades 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with object-level semantics and physics for Visual-Language Navigation, creating executable environments that improve VLN performance by 31% on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS provides photorealistic real-time rendering but lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability needed for Visual-Language Navigation tasks.

Method: Two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding adds object-level annotations to 3DGS, and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing embeds collision objects and constructs physical interfaces.

Result: Created InteriorGS dataset (1K annotated scenes) and SAGE-Bench benchmark (2M VLN data). 3DGS scenes are harder to converge but show strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on VLN-CE Unseen task.

Conclusion: SAGE-3D successfully bridges the gap between 3DGS representation and VLN requirements by adding semantic and physical capabilities, demonstrating improved navigation performance and generalizability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineRS is a two-stage MLLM reinforcement learning framework that addresses the challenge of precisely localizing and segmenting extremely small objects in high-resolution images through a coarse-to-fine pipeline with global semantic exploration and localized perceptual refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with precise understanding and localization of visual details in high-resolution images, especially for extra-small objects in cluttered contexts due to restricted input resolutions.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline: Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) for instruction-guided reasoning and coarse target region generation, and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) for accurate bounding box and segmentation mask refinement. Uses locate-informed retrospective reward to couple stages.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks on FineRS-4k dataset and public datasets.

Conclusion: FineRS effectively addresses the challenge of precise small object localization and segmentation in high-resolution images through its reinforcement learning framework and two-stage approach.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE is a sparse autoencoder that interprets vision-language alignment by mapping multi-modal representations to a unified concept set, enabling both interpretation and enhancement of VLMs through concept-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in vision-language alignment components, as it's difficult to map multi-modal representations into a unified concept set for understanding how VLMs reason across modalities.

Method: Proposes VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders, using cosine similarity for explicit alignment and encouraging consistent neuron activations for semantically similar representations to establish neuron-concept correlations.

Result: VL-SAE successfully interprets vision-language alignment by comparing semantics with concepts and enhances alignment at concept level, improving performance in zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination across multiple VLMs like CLIP and LLaVA.

Conclusion: VL-SAE provides an effective framework for both interpreting and enhancing vision-language alignment through concept-level representation mapping, demonstrating practical improvements in downstream tasks while offering interpretability insights.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

*Reed Naidoo,Matt De Vries,Olga Fourkioti,Vicky Bousgouni,Mar Arias-Garcia,Maria Portillo-Malumbres,Chris Bakal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORM is a machine learning framework that predicts 3D cellular structure changes under perturbations using a morphology encoder and diffusion-based trajectory modeling, enabling virtual cell simulation and downstream analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models are limited to 2D representations, failing to capture the complexity of 3D cell morphology under perturbations, which hinders accurate virtual cell model development.

Method: FORM uses a multi-channel VQGAN-based morphology encoder to learn 3D cell shape representations and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module to model morphological evolution across conditions, trained on 65,000+ 3D cell volumes.

Result: FORM supports unconditional morphology synthesis, conditional simulation of perturbed states, prediction of downstream signaling, combinatorial perturbation effects, and morphodynamic transitions between unseen perturbations.

Conclusion: FORM and the accompanying MorphoEval benchmark advance toward realizing 3D virtual cells by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

TL;DR: CT-CLIP is a multi-branch framework combining CNN, Transformer, and CLIP for apple leaf disease recognition, achieving over 96% accuracy by fusing local and global features and using multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods fail to adequately handle the phenotypic heterogeneity of apple leaf diseases and the relationships between local and global features in complex orchard environments.

Method: Proposes CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP) framework: CNN extracts local lesion details, Vision Transformer captures global structural relationships, Adaptive Feature Fusion Module dynamically fuses features, and multimodal image-text learning leverages pre-trained CLIP weights.

Result: Achieves 97.38% accuracy on public dataset and 96.12% on self-built dataset, outperforming baseline methods. Effectively handles lesion diversity and complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP demonstrates strong agricultural disease recognition capabilities, significantly enhances accuracy under complex conditions, and provides an innovative solution for automated disease recognition in agriculture.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework for UAV tracking that improves accuracy and robustness under challenges like camera motion and fast motion through semantic relevance exploration and includes pruning for speed-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking methods focus on speed but lack semantic awareness, leading to suboptimal performance under typical UAV challenges like camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.

Method: Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator combined with Transformer correlation maps to explore semantic relevance, enhancing search region's ability to extract important information from templates, plus pruning method for speed optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets with multiple model variants offering different speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework effectively addresses limitations of existing UAV tracking methods by improving semantic awareness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for egocentric understanding tasks by aligning model attention with human gaze during training only, improving prediction accuracy for future events and current activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye gaze provides valuable cues about attention and future actions, making it powerful for modeling egocentric behavior, but prior approaches either ignore gaze or use it as direct input rather than leveraging it for training regularization.

Method: Introduces gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze during training only, without requiring gaze at inference. The method is flexible and modular, working across multiple VLM architectures that use attention.

Result: Improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11% for future event prediction and around 7% for current activity understanding compared to baseline models trained without gaze regularization.

Conclusion: Gaze-guided training significantly improves accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs, establishing foundation for using human gaze to enhance predictive capabilities in real-world applications like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline for synthetic CT generation from MRI and CBCT using a 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder, trained with combined L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss, achieving improved anatomical fidelity through IMPACT-based registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust synthetic CT generation that addresses registration bias in supervised learning and improves anatomical consistency across different imaging modalities.

Method: 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder trained jointly across anatomical regions, using combined L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss, with test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling. Evaluated two registration strategies: Elastix with mutual information vs IMPACT feature-based similarity.

Result: IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate alignments and improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and better anatomical structures on local tests, though Elastix-aligned models scored higher on public validation due to registration bias in the evaluation pipeline.

Conclusion: Registration errors propagate into supervised learning, influencing both training and evaluation. IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports development of more robust and generalizable sCT synthesis models by promoting anatomically consistent alignment.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that enables diffusion models to adapt image generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints, allowing early-stop sampling while maintaining appropriate perceptual quality for transmission conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use fixed denoising steps regardless of network limitations, leading to wasted computation and quality loss when heavy compression is needed for bandwidth-constrained cloud-to-device scenarios.

Method: Joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on target quality levels derived from available bandwidth, using lightweight quality embeddings to guide adaptive denoising and enable early-stop sampling with minimal architectural changes.

Result: Significantly improves visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, demonstrating better perceptual quality maintenance under transmission constraints.

Conclusion: Offers a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments by enabling diffusion models to adapt generation quality to real-time network conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework for remote sensing that enables spatially controllable synthesis across multiple vision tasks like detection and segmentation, outperforming task-isolated approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated (each task requires separate generative models) and ignore geographical information and spatial constraints in remote sensing.

Method: Introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, with multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints from global to fine details. Also creates a large-scale multi-task dataset with 45k images.

Result: Achieves best generation image quality across diverse tasks and serves as universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task performance significantly with robust cross-task generalization in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: TerraGen provides a unified framework for spatially controllable remote sensing image generation that addresses limitations of task-isolated approaches and demonstrates strong performance across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this

*Zhiying Jiang,Ruhao Yan,Zengxi Zhang,Bowei Zhang,Jinyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-consistency-constrained image stitching method that addresses parallax issues through multi-stage alignment with depth regularization and graph-based seam optimization, achieving superior performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image stitching often suffers from ghosting and misalignment due to significant variations in object depth and large parallax when capturing images from multiple perspectives.

Method: Uses multi-stage mechanism with global depth regularization constraints for alignment, graph-based low-cost computation for optimal stitching seams, soft-seam region diffusion for transition areas, and reparameterization strategy for efficiency optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance against existing methods, effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural seamless stitching results.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses parallax challenges in image stitching through depth-constrained alignment and optimized seam computation, providing both high-quality results and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVR, a new benchmark for Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval that supports video-centric multi-modal queries and focuses on retrieving relevant segments from long untrimmed videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video retrieval for long-video platforms by addressing the limitations of existing methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as improving multi-video understanding and reranking capabilities.

Method: Proposes MUVR benchmark with three versions (Base, Filter, QA) containing 53K untrimmed videos from Bilibili, 1,050 multi-modal queries, and 84K matches. Features multi-level visual correspondence across six levels and supports queries with long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts.

Result: Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs revealed limitations in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs' weaknesses in multi-video understanding and reranking.

Conclusion: MUVR provides a comprehensive benchmark that exposes current limitations in video retrieval systems and enables future research to improve multi-modal query processing and untrimmed video retrieval capabilities for long-video platforms.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable framework for adaptive visual concept learning that identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes using pretrained vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to predefined axes like color and shape and typically work only in synthetic datasets, failing to capture the rich spectrum of semantic dimensions that human intelligence effortlessly interprets.

Method: Leverages a pretrained vision-language model with universal prompting strategy to identify diverse image-related axes without prior knowledge, uses a universal concept encoder to bind visual features to discovered axes without additional parameters, and optimizes a compositional anchoring objective for independent axis manipulation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ datasets, showing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts and strong compositional generalization, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables adaptive visual concept learning in real-world scenes, overcoming limitations of predefined concept axes and synthetic datasets while maintaining strong compositional generalization.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent is a generative framework that synthesizes articulated 3D objects with fine geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance by combining sparse voxel representations with articulation properties in a unified latent space using VAE and latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating human-made 3D objects that require both geometric consistency and realistic articulation dynamics, particularly for objects with moving parts like furniture where articulation affects visibility and appearance.

Method: Jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics by embedding sparse voxel representations and articulation properties (joint type, axis, origin, range, part category) into a unified latent space via VAE, then trains a latent diffusion model for diverse sampling. Uses articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that conditions appearance on articulation state to handle visibility changes.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity, achieving realistic texture features even for typically occluded regions across different articulation configurations.

Conclusion: ArtiLatent provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation by effectively modeling both geometry and articulation dynamics in a unified framework.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [44] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes anisotropic pooling methods to replace average pooling in LUT-based CNN image restoration, achieving better performance by adaptively weighing contributions from differently oriented pixel patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT-based CNN restoration methods use average pooling for fusing look-up results from different orientations, which is ill-suited for anisotropic signal structures and limits performance.

Method: Two anisotropic pooling methods: generalized median pooling and data-dependent pooling coefficients that adaptively weigh contributions from differently oriented pixel patches.

Result: Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks show both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Conclusion: Anisotropic pooling strategies significantly improve LUT-based CNN restoration performance by better handling anisotropic signal structures compared to naive averaging.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

*Lisa Weijler,Sebastian Koch,Fabio Poiesi,Timo Ropinski,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype uses hyperbolic latent space to model hierarchical 3D scene structures, enabling efficient multi-scale representation without predefined hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hierarchical 3D scene modeling require multiple rendering passes or predefined discrete hierarchies, limiting efficiency and generalization to real-world diverse structures.

Method: Proposes OpenHype that represents scene hierarchies using continuous hyperbolic latent space, leveraging hyperbolic geometry properties to encode multi-scale relationships and enable smooth hierarchy traversal via geodesic paths.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic latent space provides an effective solution for modeling hierarchical 3D structures, offering improved efficiency and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoniTor is a training-free online video anomaly detection method that uses vision-language models with memory mechanisms and scoring queues to identify unusual activities in real-time videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online video anomaly detection has been neglected due to real-time constraints and computational intensity, despite advances in LLMs and VLMs that could enable more nuanced anomaly understanding.

Method: Uses streaming input to VLMs with LSTM-inspired prediction mechanism to capture temporal dependencies, plus a scoring queue and anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and guide LLMs in distinguishing normal vs abnormal behaviors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without requiring training.

Conclusion: MoniTor successfully addresses online VAD challenges through memory-based mechanisms and achieves strong performance without training, demonstrating the potential of leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for real-time anomaly detection.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice is a novel video inpainting framework that decouples the task into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation, using spaced-frame priors and a CoSpliced Module to enhance spatiotemporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inpainting methods using I2V priors struggle with severe content degradation and overlook spatiotemporal stability, leading to insufficient control over video generation.

Method: Proposes VidSplice with spaced-frame priors, CoSpliced Module for first-frame propagation, and context controller module to constrain content distortion during generation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios with significant improvements in foreground alignment and motion stability.

Conclusion: VidSplice outperforms existing approaches by effectively addressing spatiotemporal stability issues in video inpainting through its novel framework design.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC is a novel framework that makes chest X-ray AI diagnosis interpretable by discovering clinically relevant visual patterns through transcoder-based sparse autoencoders trained on diagnostic classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. Clinicians need transparent explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failures.

Method: Trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical images into interpretable visual patterns. Uses ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from MIMIC-CXR dataset to discover ~5,000 monosemantic patterns across clinical categories.

Result: Achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while providing transparent attribution where predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable activation galleries. Patterns span cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories.

Conclusion: Medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable. The key innovation is extracting interpretable features from classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general embeddings, ensuring patterns are clinically relevant and supporting safer deployment through transparent explanations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream architecture that integrates macroscale tissue features with aggregated cellular representations using a recurrent transformer for efficient cell-level modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on histopathological subtype classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models capture global tissue context but lack cell-level feature modeling, which is crucial for fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification.

Method: Dual-stream architecture with receptance-weighted key-value aggregation (recurrent transformer for linear-complexity cell dependencies) and bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module for mutual attention between cellular cues and tissue environment.

Result: Outperforms existing models on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction are critical for fine-grained computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but lack fine-grained regional analysis due to scarce annotated data and absence of fine-grained pre-training paradigms.

Method: Constructed Gran-29M dataset with 180M region-level annotations, developed pretraining-adaptation framework with self-distillation mechanism using bounding-box-to-caption and caption-to-bounding-box regression, and incorporated explicit localization constraints.

Result: GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders, achieves strong transferability to varying LLMs, and attains state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: GranViT successfully addresses the limitations of existing vision encoders by integrating fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to LLMs through comprehensive region-level training and achieves superior performance across multiple vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foresight Guidance (FSG), a new approach for text-to-image diffusion models that improves upon Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by reframing conditional guidance as fixed point iterations and solving longer-interval subproblems with increased iterations in early stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to CFG stem from divergent theoretical interpretations, limiting design space and obscuring key design choices. The authors aim to provide a unified perspective and address the theoretical inefficiency of existing methods.

Method: The authors reframe conditional guidance as fixed point iterations seeking a golden path where latents produce consistent outputs. They introduce FSG, which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion stages with increased iterations, moving beyond the single-step short-interval iteration of CFG.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures validate FSG's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The work offers novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of adaptive design in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to analyze and rank attention heads in text-generative models based on their specialization in semantic or visual attributes, enabling targeted editing of model outputs by modifying as few as 1% of heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of language and vision-language models, specifically how individual attention heads specialize in semantic or visual attributes, despite their impressive performance across various tasks.

Method: Reinterpreting probing of intermediate activations through signal processing lens to analyze multiple samples systematically and rank attention heads based on relevance to target concepts.

Result: Consistent patterns of specialization at head level across unimodal and multimodal transformers; editing just 1% of selected heads can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in model output.

Conclusion: Attention layers contain interpretable and controllable structure, providing simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models, validated across language and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

### [55] [Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581)
*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control is a lightweight video-to-audio generation method that connects frozen pretrained video and audio models using a small cross-attention bridge, enabling synchronized audio generation from video while maintaining prompt controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a video-guided Foley system that preserves the strong capabilities of pretrained single-modality models while learning only the cross-modal dependencies needed for synchronization, avoiding expensive end-to-end retraining.

Method: Connects V-JEPA2 video embeddings to frozen Stable Audio Open DiT T2A model by inserting compact video cross-attention after existing text cross-attention, with video token pooling to reduce memory and stabilize training.

Result: Achieves competitive temporal and semantic alignment on video-audio benchmarks with far fewer trainable parameters than multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven controllability and modularity.

Conclusion: The lightweight bridge approach effectively learns audio-video dependencies for synchronization while keeping backbones frozen, and the design can extend to other audio modalities beyond Foley.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

*Yifu Luo,Penghui Du,Bo Li,Sinan Du,Tiantian Zhang,Yongzhe Chang,Kai Wu,Kun Gai,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by shifting from step-level to chunk-level optimization, addressing inaccurate advantage attribution and temporal dynamics neglect in flow-matching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO faces limitations in accurate advantage attribution and neglects temporal dynamics in text-to-image generation, which chunk-level optimization can effectively address.

Method: Groups consecutive steps into coherent chunks to capture temporal dynamics, optimizes policies at chunk level, and optionally uses weighted sampling for enhanced performance.

Result: Achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Chunk-level optimization shows promise for GRPO-based methods in text-to-image generation, effectively addressing key limitations of step-level approaches.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gompertz-CNN is a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that uses the Gompertz growth model to adjust distillation loss weights based on student learning stages, achieving up to 8% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models during training, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes stage-aware distillation using Gompertz curve to dynamically adjust distillation loss weights, incorporates Wasserstein distance for feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching for backward propagation alignment, unified under multi-loss objective.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms traditional methods, achieving up to 8% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 and 4% on CIFAR-100 across various teacher-student architectures.

Conclusion: The Gompertz-CNN framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional knowledge distillation by modeling student learning progression, demonstrating superior performance through dynamic loss adjustment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

TL;DR: TIGER is a two-stage super-resolution framework that breaks the trade-off between image quality and text readability by first reconstructing text structures then using them to guide full-image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative super-resolution methods perform well on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability.

Method: TIGER uses a "text-first, image-later" paradigm that explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement. It first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide subsequent full-image super-resolution through glyph-to-image guidance.

Result: TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing readability while preserving overall image quality. The method is supported by UltraZoom-ST, the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (×14.29).

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework successfully breaks the trade-off between image quality and text readability in super-resolution tasks through explicit text structure reconstruction and guided image enhancement.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene

*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group Inertial Poser is a novel method that combines sparse wearable IMUs with UWB ranging to accurately track full-body motion and global trajectories for multiple individuals, overcoming limitations of purely IMU-based tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure IMU-based tracking has limitations in translation estimates and relative positioning between individuals since inertial cues are self-referential and lack spatial references for others. The paper aims to address these limitations by incorporating distance measurements between sensors.

Method: The method uses ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) to estimate absolute distances between pairs of sensors on and across individuals, fuses them with inertial observations in structured state-space models, and employs a novel two-step optimization for accurate global trajectory tracking.

Result: Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across both synthetic and real-world data. The authors also introduced GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking with 200 minutes of motion recordings from 14 participants.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in real-world scenarios, providing more accurate and robust tracking compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (ANN and CNN) can effectively detect interictal epileptic spikes in MEG recordings using limited temporal and single-expert annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with F1-scores of 0.46 and 0.44 respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual detection of interictal epileptic spikes in MEG recordings is tedious, error-prone with moderate interrater agreement, and current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice due to extensive annotation requirements or lack of robustness.

Method: Proposed two deep learning architectures: feature-based ANN and CNN, trained on 59 patients' data, using interactive machine learning to iteratively improve annotation quality from intermediary model outputs, and evaluated against state-of-the-art models on short time windows.

Result: Both models outperformed state-of-the-art methods on 10 holdout test patients (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44), with interactive learning demonstrating robustness to noisy annotations and simple architectures showing strong performance on complex, imperfectly annotated data.

Conclusion: Simple deep learning architectures are robust for analyzing complex MEG data with imperfect annotations, and the interactive machine learning approach enables faster data annotation while providing efficient automated spike detection tools for clinical practice.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies post-hoc explainability methods to neural network-based seal detection in aerial imagery to build trust and identify model limitations for ecological monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of trust in black-box neural network models for ecological research and conservation monitoring by providing evidence for predictions and documenting deployment limitations.

Method: Trained Faster R-CNN on aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park to detect harbor seals, then applied multiple explanation methods: gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), LIME, and perturbation-based explanations.

Result: Explanations focused on seal torsos and contours rather than background, removal of seals reduced detection confidence, and analysis uncovered systematic errors like confusion between seals and black ice/rocks.

Conclusion: Pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability enables moving beyond black-box predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring, with actionable next steps for model improvement.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Motivation: Salient object detection faces data limitations due to expensive pixel-precise annotations, forcing separate model training for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD.

Method: Multi-modal diffusion pipeline generates S3OD dataset with 139,000+ high-resolution images using diffusion and DINO-v3 features, with iterative generation prioritizing challenging categories. Streamlined multi-mask decoder handles ambiguity by predicting multiple valid interpretations.

Result: Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Large-scale synthetic data generation and ambiguity-aware architecture dramatically improve generalization in salient object detection tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and

high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent

TL;DR: Modest-Align is a lightweight cross-modal alignment framework that addresses overconfidence and performance degradation in resource-constrained settings through random perturbation and embedding smoothing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal alignment models like CLIP suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance when operating with limited or low-quality data, particularly due to ambiguous image-text pairs and contrastive learning approaches that reinforce overconfidence.

Method: Proposes Modest-Align with two complementary strategies: Random Perturbation (introduces controlled noise to simulate uncertainty) and Embedding Smoothing (calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Modest-Align offers a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios by reducing overconfidence and improving performance on noisy or weakly aligned samples.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using epipolar geometry constraints to improve video diffusion models, addressing geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion through preference-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts despite large-scale training, failing to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying realistic 3D scenes.

Method: Align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, enforcing geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements.

Result: Evaluation shows classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment quality. The model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic content.

Conclusion: By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, this approach presents a practical method for generating spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

TL;DR: DAP-MAE is a domain-adaptive masked autoencoder method that adaptively integrates knowledge from cross-domain point cloud datasets to address data scarcity issues while maintaining alignment with downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data is limited across different domains, and combining mixed-domain data for MAE pre-training often leads to degraded performance in downstream tasks due to misaligned prior knowledge.

Method: Proposes DAP-MAE with a heterogeneous domain adapter that uses adaptation mode during pre-training and fusion mode during fine-tuning, plus a domain feature generator to guide feature adaptation for various downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves 95.18% accuracy in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus with only one pre-training, showing excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in point cloud analysis by adaptively integrating cross-domain knowledge while maintaining task alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition (LTR) methods for species recognition on the imbalanced NACTI wildlife dataset, achieving 99.40% Top-1 accuracy and demonstrating improved generalization under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The North America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset exhibits severe long-tailed class imbalance, with the largest class covering over 50% of 3.7M images, necessitating specialized LTR approaches for effective species recognition.

Method: Built on PyTorch Wildlife model, the study systematically evaluates various LTR loss functions and LTR-sensitive regularization techniques, including experiments with different scheduler choices and evaluation on domain-shifted test sets.

Result: Best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on NACTI test data (up from 95.51% baseline), and 52.55% accuracy on Reduced-Bias Test set from ENA-Detection dataset (up from 51.20%), showing improved generalization under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: LTR-enhancing scheduler choices consistently improve performance, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art LTR losses, though limitations remain including catastrophic breakdown for 'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. All dataset splits, code, and weights are published for reproducibility.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We

### [67] [Self-Supervised Learning of Synapse Types from EM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21663)
*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised method for classifying synapses in EM images based on spatial proximity, without requiring predefined classes or labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synapse classification requires supervised learning with labeled examples, which limits flexibility and requires prior knowledge of synapse types. The authors aim to develop a more flexible approach that can discover synapse classes automatically.

Method: The method leverages the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are more similar than randomly selected synapses from different cells. This spatial proximity principle is used to cluster synapses without supervision, and the approach doesn't require knowing the number of synapse types in advance.

Result: The methodology was successfully applied to Drosophila data, demonstrating that unsupervised classification based on spatial proximity is feasible and effective for synapse type discovery.

Conclusion: This unsupervised approach provides a principled way to identify ground-truth synapse types that span the range of synaptic structures, offering advantages over traditional supervised methods by eliminating the need for predefined classes and labeled training data.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

*Riya Gupta,Yiwei Zong,Dennis H. Murphree*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates UNI and Virchow2 foundation models for classifying whole-slide images into melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions, finding Virchow2 features generally outperform UNI with logistic regression achieving 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid generation of whole-slide images in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification.

Method: Used patch-level embeddings from foundation models aggregated into slide-level features via mean-aggregation, trained multiple classifiers (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, random forest), and assessed performance using precision, recall, AUROC metrics.

Result: Virchow2 outperformed UNI across most classifiers, with logistic regression achieving 90% accuracy for Virchow2 (though not statistically significant). Mean-aggregation provided reliable slide-level feature representations.

Conclusion: Foundation models show strong potential for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable approach for dermatopathological diagnosis and paving the way for slide-level representation learning advancements.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow is a hierarchical framework for generating infinitely extendable 3D worlds with coherent geometry and realistic appearance, addressing limitations of existing 2D-lifting, 3D implicit, and object-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges: 2D-lifting approaches have geometric and appearance inconsistencies, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting scene-level generation.

Method: Leverages strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D models for structured scene block generation. Features three core components: (1) data curation pipeline for high-quality scene blocks, (2) 3D block inpainting for context-aware extension, and (3) coarse-to-fine generation strategy for global layout and local fidelity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction on 3D-FRONT dataset, uniquely supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and has potential for building future world models.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

*Han Yan,Xibin Song,Yifu Wang,Hongdong Li,Pan Ji,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid is a training-free method for consistent video generation that achieves both character and background consistency across multiple videos by analyzing and leveraging DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, without needing reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for consistent video generation rely on reference images or extensive training, and typically only address character consistency while leaving background consistency to image-to-video models.

Method: The method analyzes DiT's attention mechanism to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during denoising, then caches intermediate variables from an identity video and injects them into corresponding positions in newly generated videos.

Result: Experimental results show that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: BachVid offers a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation that doesn't rely on reference images or additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models can solve geometric problems by treating them as image generation tasks, transforming noisy geometric structures into valid solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge generative modeling with geometric problem solving by using visual diffusion models as geometric solvers for notoriously hard problems.

Method: Treat geometric problems as images and train standard visual diffusion models to transform Gaussian noise into images representing valid approximate solutions.

Result: Successfully applied to three hard geometric problems: Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem.

Conclusion: Operating in image space provides a general framework for approximating hard geometric problems, opening doors to tackling a wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated framework using self-reflective agents to detect visual attribute dependencies in vision models, improving performance through iterative hypothesis testing and self-evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect unintended reliance on specific visual features in vision models, ensuring robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations.

Method: A self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes, iteratively refining hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and using self-evaluation to assess findings.

Result: The agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, showing significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines on a benchmark of 130 models across 18 categories, and identifies real-world dependencies in models like CLIP and YOLOv8.

Conclusion: The self-reflective framework effectively detects visual attribute dependencies in vision models, demonstrating the value of iterative hypothesis refinement and self-evaluation for model analysis.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts hand-drawn floor plan sketches into 3D BIM models using multimodal LLMs in a multi-agent framework with iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts by enabling conversion from simple freehand sketches to professional 3D models.

Method: Uses multimodal LLMs in multi-agent framework combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema validation, and automated BIM scripting. Sketches are refined into structured JSON layouts then converted to executable BIM scripts.

Result: Experiments on 10 floor plans show strong performance: openings captured with high reliability initially, wall detection starts at 83% and reaches near-perfect alignment after feedback. All metrics (precision, recall, F1) remain above 0.83, geometric errors decrease to zero through feedback.

Conclusion: MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning successfully enables BIM creation from freehand sketches, demonstrating accessibility for both expert and non-expert users.

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS) is a concept-selection method that generates creative ideas by finding combinations that are highly coherent but culturally atypical, outperforming baselines and matching human art students in originality and harmony.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to generate ideas that are both original and coherent in open-ended domains like art - they either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence for novelty.

Method: CAS uses two GPT-2 models: a Concept Coherence Model that scores concept co-occurrence plausibility, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates typicality within artists' work. It selects combinations high in coherence but low in typicality.

Result: Human evaluation (N=100) showed CAS outperformed random selection and GPT-4o baselines, achieving performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Quantitative analysis showed more diverse outputs and broader conceptual exploration than GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents by maintaining internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions.

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes extensional fuzzy numbers as an alternative to traditional fuzzy sets to address computational complexity and shape preservation issues in fuzzy number operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fuzzy number operations using Zadeh's extension rule have high computational complexity, don't preserve shape features (e.g., triangular fuzzy sets don't remain triangular after multiplication), and suffer from increasing fuzziness with multiple operations.

Method: The paper introduces extensional fuzzy numbers and defines operations (arithmetic and relational operators =, >, >=, <, <=) for them, providing C++ implementation available on GitHub.

Result: The proposed approach is illustrated with several application examples, showing that extensional fuzzy numbers can overcome the limitations of traditional fuzzy sets.

Conclusion: Extensional fuzzy numbers provide a viable alternative to traditional fuzzy sets that addresses key limitations in computational complexity and shape preservation during operations.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using customized open-source LLMs to extract and standardize MOUD prescription data from heterogeneous EHR systems, achieving high accuracy in computing medication coverage metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmonizing medication data across different EHR systems is challenging due to scattered prescription attributes in various formats and freetext notes, hindering consistent monitoring of medications for opioid use disorder.

Method: Customize open-source LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, MedGemma) to extract unified MOUD prescription attributes from heterogeneous data, process records in fixed JSON schema, perform normalization and cross-field consistency checks.

Result: Larger models performed best: Qwen2.5-32B achieved 93.4% coverage with 93.0% exact-match accuracy, MedGemma-27B attained 93.1%/92.2% on 25,605 records from 1,257 patients across five clinics.

Conclusion: This approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention by removing brittle site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems can qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to reliability, but AI Preemptionism (replacing human judgment) faces amplified objections. A better approach is a total evidence view where AI outputs serve as contributory reasons alongside human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when AI outputs should be deferred to over human expert judgment, addressing the epistemological challenges of AI authority and developing principled guidelines for justified AI deference.

Method: Draws on social epistemology to analyze AI systems as Artificial Epistemic Authorities, critiques AI Preemptionism, and develops a total evidence view where AI outputs function as contributory reasons rather than replacements for human judgment.

Result: Identifies three key advantages of the total evidence approach: (1) mitigates expertise atrophy by keeping humans engaged, (2) provides epistemic justification for meaningful human oversight, (3) explains justified mistrust when reliability conditions are unmet.

Conclusion: The total evidence view offers a principled framework for determining justified AI deference, particularly in high-stakes contexts, by treating AI outputs as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements for human epistemic considerations.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework that translates natural language questions into spatial SQL queries, achieving 87.7% accuracy on spatial queries through specialized agents and self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity of SQL and geospatial functions that create barriers for non-experts in spatial data analysis, addressing limitations of single-agent LLM approaches for spatial queries.

Method: Multi-agent framework with knowledge base, embeddings for context retrieval, and specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, plus a review agent for programmatic and semantic validation.

Result: 81.2% overall accuracy on KaggleDBQA (221/272 questions) and 87.7% accuracy on spatial queries (79/90 questions), compared to 76.7% without the review agent. System sometimes generates queries more semantically aligned with user intent than benchmark queries.

Conclusion: The framework makes spatial analysis more accessible and provides a robust foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing autonomous GIS development.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign is a framework that addresses hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and multi-institutional collaboration challenges in medical LVLMs through multimodal DPO, retrieval-aware MoE, and federated governance with adaptive CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models have potential for smart healthcare but face three critical deployment challenges: hallucination of answers not grounded in visual evidence, inefficient fixed-depth reasoning, and difficulty in multi-institutional collaboration.

Method: Proposes multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) for visual context alignment, Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture for routing queries to specialized experts, and federated governance with local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator for adaptive Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three Med-VQA datasets, outperforming retrieval-augmented baselines by up to 11.85% in F1-score and reducing average reasoning length by 51.60% compared to fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: MedAlign effectively addresses key challenges in medical LVLM deployment through its integrated approach of visual alignment, expert routing, and adaptive reasoning, enabling more reliable and efficient clinical services.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Motivation: Off-policy learning methods like Q-learning are effective but vulnerable to biased data with unobserved confounding in complex environments, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.

Method: Builds on Deep Q-Network (DQN) to develop a novel algorithm that finds safe policies for worst-case environments compatible with observations, addressing confounding biases.

Result: Applied to twelve confounded Atari games, the method consistently outperforms standard DQN in all games where behavioral and target policy inputs mismatch and unobserved confounders exist.

Conclusion: The proposed robust algorithm effectively handles confounding biases in off-policy learning, demonstrating superior performance over standard methods in complex, confounded environments.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines

*Jihyun Lee,Yejin Min,San Kim,Yejin Jeon,SungJun Yang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACE dataset for panic attack counseling using Psychological First Aid principles, PACER model trained with supervised learning and preference alignment, outperforms baselines in panic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of suitable datasets for panic attack intervention due to ethical/logistical issues, and need for timely appropriate support during acute fear episodes.

Method: Created PACE dataset from first-person narratives structured around PFA principles, trained PACER model using supervised learning and simulated preference alignment, evaluated with PanicEval framework.

Result: PACER outperforms strong baselines in counselor-side metrics and client affect improvement, consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in panic scenarios.

Conclusion: PACER provides effective empathetic and directive support for panic attacks, demonstrating practical value in crisis counseling scenarios.

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

### [83] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroGenPoisoning is a novel RAG poisoning attack that uses LLM neuron attribution and genetic optimization to generate adversarial external knowledge, achieving over 90% success rate in overriding model memory while resolving knowledge conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG poisoning attacks ignore model internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities, and don't address knowledge conflicts with strong parametric knowledge in RAG systems.

Method: Identifies Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation correlates with poisoning knowledge, then uses genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons, enabling massive-scale generation of poisoned knowledge.

Result: Consistently achieves high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% across models and datasets while preserving fluency, effectively resolving knowledge conflict.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that neuron-guided poisoning can effectively compromise RAG systems by leveraging internal representation dynamics, highlighting new vulnerabilities in retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [84] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt is an automated framework that optimizes prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs using evolutionary graph optimization and causal guidance, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs on domain-specific tasks is challenging, especially regarding domain knowledge integration, reasoning efficiency, and providing domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints.

Method: EGO-Prompt starts with general prompts and fault-tolerant Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) from experts, then uses causal-guided textual gradient optimization in two steps: generating deterministic reasoning guidance from SCGs, and adapting LLMs to utilize this guidance with original inputs.

Result: EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than state-of-the-art methods, allows small models to reach larger model performance at under 20% of original cost, and outputs refined domain-specific SCGs that improve interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates prompt optimization and reasoning process design while enhancing performance, reducing costs, and improving interpretability through refined causal graphs.

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [85] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT is a prompting method that improves LLMs' ability to follow probabilistic instructions by having them generate random strings first to create entropy, then manipulate those strings to produce diverse answers that match target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF) where they need to select answers from predefined options with specific probabilities. This causes biases and reduces response diversity, which is problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors like human simulation, content diversification, and games.

Method: SSoT instructs LLMs to first output a random string to generate entropy, then manipulate this string to extract randomness and derive final answers while preserving diversity and adhering to constraints.

Result: SSoT significantly improves PIF performance, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. It also enhances response diversity in open-ended tasks as shown in NoveltyBench experiments.

Conclusion: SSoT effectively addresses LLMs' limitations in probabilistic reasoning and diversity generation through a simple prompting technique that leverages string-based entropy generation.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL is a memory-free continual learning framework that uses null space adaptation to preserve zero-shot capabilities in vision-language models while adapting to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained VLMs like CLIP face distributional shifts and novel tasks in real deployment, requiring continual learning methods that avoid catastrophic forgetting while maintaining zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Uses low-rank adaptation and constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space of current parameters to minimize interference with previous knowledge.

Result: Effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities and achieves competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: NuSA-CL provides a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shylock is a novel method for discovering causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) that works well in both few-shot and normal data scenarios, addressing limitations of existing methods that are error-prone, rely on idealized assumptions, and require large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods are error-prone, stuck at idealized assumptions, rely on huge amounts of data, and are easily over-fitting on MTS data. There's a serious data gap in accessing MTS in many areas, making causal relationship discovery difficult.

Method: Shylock uses group dilated convolution and sharing kernels to exponentially reduce parameters while learning better representations of variables with time delay. It combines global and local constraints to enable information sharing among networks for improved accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-the-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. The authors also developed Tcausal library for easy use and deployed it on EarthDataMiner platform.

Conclusion: Shylock effectively addresses the challenges of causal relationship discovery in MTS, particularly in few-shot scenarios, by reducing parameters exponentially while maintaining good representation learning and achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI

*Victoria J. Hodge,Colin Paterson,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques for safety assurance in autonomous systems, focusing on safety-critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of AI-enabled autonomous systems requires rigorous safety demonstration, which is challenging due to the need to handle novel and uncertain situations throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting OOD data.

Method: The review analyzes OOD detection techniques by defining relevant concepts, investigating causes of OOD, exploring safety assurance challenges, and identifying techniques applicable throughout the ML development lifecycle.

Result: The review identifies a range of OOD detection techniques that can be integrated into system lifecycles to support safety assurance arguments, while highlighting important caveats for system and safety engineers.

Conclusion: The paper outlines challenges and future work needed for the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across various domains and applications.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [90] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive λ-strategies for UCT algorithm to make it agnostic to reward scales, recommending λ = 2σ as the best performing method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT algorithm is sensitive to reward scales, which causes problems in games with dense rewards of varying magnitudes. Current approaches require hand-picked reward scales.

Method: Evaluated various λ-strategies (including five new ones) that adaptively choose UCT exploration constant λ based on game statistics, particularly using empirical standard deviation of Q-values.

Result: The proposed λ = 2σ strategy outperforms existing methods across various tasks in both single parameter performance and peak optimized performance.

Conclusion: Using λ = 2σ (where σ is empirical standard deviation of Q-values) is recommended as the best adaptive strategy for UCT exploration constant that works across different reward scales.

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Self-Jailbreak vulnerability in Large Reasoning Models where they override their own safety assessments, and proposes Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) training to fix unsafe reasoning steps while preserving reasoning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mitigation strategies suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off in Large Reasoning Models, which remain vulnerable to harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps to steer models back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoG substantially improves safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Conclusion: CoG effectively addresses the safety-reasoning trade-off by fixing unsafe reasoning steps without compromising reasoning capabilities, providing a systematic solution to Self-Jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that combines LLM-based code generation with symbolic verification and interactive validation to improve embodied task planning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based code-as-policies approaches suffer from limited environmental grounding in dynamic/partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates.

Method: Incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation, including exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states.

Result: Improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions in RLBench and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The integrated neuro-symbolic approach enhances grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI trustworthiness research focuses primarily on technical attributes while overlooking critical sociotechnical dimensions needed to understand AI in real-world contexts.

Method: Scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across research domains.

Result: Significant progress in technical attributes but critical gaps: overemphasis on technical precision at expense of social/ethical considerations, sociotechnical nature remains unexplored, trustworthiness emerges as contested concept shaped by power dynamics.

Conclusion: Interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential; actionable measures proposed for holistic frameworks addressing AI-society interplay.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

<details>

Motivation: Safety is crucial for autonomous systems, but specifying failure states (like tailgating in driving) is often non-obvious or difficult, while expert demonstrations that avoid failures are easier to generate.

Method: Use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies states as safe or unsafe, then use this function to label simulated trajectories for training neural CBFs, creating safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls.

Result: Empirical evaluation in four environments shows the approach outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to neural CBFs trained with ground-truth safety labels.

Conclusion: The proposed ICL-based method provides an effective data-driven alternative for neural CBF synthesis when formal failure specifications are unavailable but expert demonstrations exist.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [95] [CXRAgent: Director-Orchestrated Multi-Stage Reasoning for Chest X-Ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21324)
*Jinhui Lou,Yan Yang,Zhou Yu,Zhenqi Fu,Weidong Han,Qingming Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CXRAgent is a director-orchestrated multi-stage agent for chest X-ray interpretation that coordinates tool invocation with evidence validation, diagnostic planning with expert team assembly, and collaborative decision-making to improve adaptability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CXR analysis models struggle with adapting to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios, and lack mechanisms for assessing tool reliability, limiting their adaptability and credibility.

Method: A three-stage approach: (1) Tool Invocation with Evidence-driven Validator for output normalization and verification; (2) Diagnostic Planning that formulates targeted plans and assembles expert teams; (3) Collaborative Decision-making that integrates expert insights with contextual memories.

Result: Experiments show CXRAgent delivers strong performance on various CXR interpretation tasks, provides visual evidence, and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

Conclusion: CXRAgent represents an effective multi-stage agent framework that enhances CXR interpretation through orchestrated tool coordination, evidence validation, and collaborative reasoning, improving both performance and reliability.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan is a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search with hierarchical guidance to help LLMs generate more innovative ideas by steering exploration away from familiar concepts and using explicit reward structures instead of flawed self-evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with generating truly innovative ideas, defaulting to familiar concepts from training data. Existing methods like Tree of Thoughts rely on unprincipled self-evaluation heuristics that limit creative exploration.

Method: Magellan reframes creative generation as guided exploration using Monte Carlo Tree Search with a hierarchical guidance system: a "semantic compass" for long-range direction and a landscape-aware value function for local decisions that balances coherence, novelty, and narrative progress.

Result: Extensive experiments show Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines including ReAct and Tree of Thoughts in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation.

Conclusion: For creative discovery, principled guided search is more effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more capable partners in innovation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [97] [Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency of Budget Forcing in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21398)
*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining reinforcement learning (RL) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves mathematical reasoning in small language models by boosting accuracy while reducing token usage by over 40% compared to SFT-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Budget forcing methods for test-time scaling rely on SFT with long-context reasoning traces, which causes performance degradation in smaller models due to verbose responses. The goal is to improve token efficiency and boost performance of small models for mathematical reasoning.

Method: Integration of reinforcement learning (RL) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to improve token efficiency. The approach uses only 1.5K training samples and is tested on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets.

Result: The SFT+RL model achieved higher overall accuracy while reducing token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT-only model. This demonstrates that RL can recover losses from long-context training and improve mathematical reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively complements supervised fine-tuning by improving token efficiency and recovering performance losses in small language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, enabling better performance with significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

*Maneeha Rani,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the transparency gap in LLMs by proposing a novel taxonomy and roadmap for integrating symbolic AI techniques, organizing existing literature across four dimensions to enhance LLM transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency despite their effectiveness, and existing Neurosymbolic AI methods designed for conventional neural networks are not well-suited for LLMs' unique features, creating a need for systematic understanding of symbolic integration.

Method: The paper reviews established NeSy AI methods and proposes a novel taxonomy with a roadmap for symbolic integration in LLMs, categorizing across four dimensions: integration stages, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, and algorithmic/application perspectives.

Result: The research organizes existing literature within the proposed categorization framework, identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps in the field to provide a comprehensive roadmap for future research.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical insights for implementing symbolic integration frameworks in LLMs to enhance transparency, highlighting both latest developments and notable gaps to guide future research directions.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k is a dataset of 11,000+ handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models with LaTeX and modeling language labels, used to train AutoOpt - an automated ML framework that converts optimization problem images to solutions through three modules: image-to-text recognition, text-to-text script generation, and bilevel optimization solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the process of solving mathematical optimization problems by eliminating manual intervention, enabling users to simply provide an image of the formulation and get automated solutions.

Method: Three-module framework: M1 uses deep learning for Mathematical Expression Recognition (image to LaTeX), M2 uses fine-tuned LLM for LaTeX to PYOMO script conversion, M3 uses Bilevel Optimization based Decomposition to solve the optimization problems. Dataset created by 25 experts with two-phase verification.

Result: The MER model outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score. BOBD method yields better results on complex test problems compared to interior-point algorithm and genetic algorithm. Dataset contains diverse optimization problems with various complexities.

Conclusion: AutoOpt framework successfully automates optimization problem solving from images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods on complex problems, enabled by the comprehensive AutoOpt-11k dataset.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MoSES framework that decomposes multi-task vehicle routing problems into basis VRP variants, enabling unified solvers to reuse specialized basis solvers through state decomposition and latent space mixture functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural methods for multi-task VRPs underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants and miss benefits of specialized basis solvers, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that expresses state space as Cartesian product of basis state spaces, and Latent Space-based SDMDP with optimal basis policies and learnable mixture function. Implements MoSES with specialized LoRA experts and adaptive gating mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments across VRP variants show MoSES outperforms prior methods by effectively leveraging basis solver reuse and compositional structure.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables unified solvers to perceive shared-component nature across VRP variants while mitigating exponential growth of trained neural solvers, achieving superior performance through basis policy reuse.

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench is a benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' compliance with EU legal norms when benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents deployed with tools can exhibit unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, including taking illegal actions under EU legislation.

Method: Created a verifiable human-curated benchmark with scenarios across data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity categories. Compared model function calls against a rubric supported by relevant EU legislature citations.

Result: Evaluated frontier LLMs' legal compliance and investigated the effect of providing legislative excerpts in system prompts with explicit compliance instructions.

Conclusion: The benchmark helps measure LLM agents' propensity for illegal actions under EU law and encourages extending agentic safety benchmarks to other jurisdictions and multi-turn/multilingual interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight improves long-horizon reasoning in LLM agents through conflict-aware verification and structured facts management, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails due to insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning rather than generative weaknesses.

Method: Uses Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) to identify and falsify conflicts among expert agents, and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF) to organize, validate, and synchronize evidence across agents.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%), Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

Conclusion: Co-Sight offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents through the synergy of structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM), a self-improving coding agent that uses a novel metric (CMP) to guide tree search for self-modifications, achieving human-level performance on coding benchmarks with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving coding agents focus on benchmark performance, but there's a mismatch between performance and actual self-improvement potential (metaproductivity).

Method: Proposed CMP metric aggregates descendant performances to estimate self-improvement potential. HGM uses CMP estimation to guide tree search for self-modifications.

Result: HGM outperforms prior methods on SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot with less wall-clock time, and achieves human-level performance on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5.

Conclusion: CMP metric effectively captures self-improvement potential, enabling HGM to achieve superior performance and efficiency in self-improving coding agents.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Motivation: Existing agent frameworks follow predefined workflows that limit autonomous and global task completion, while real-world tasks require external tools and long-horizon interactions.

Method: DeepAgent uses autonomous memory folding to compress past interactions into structured memories, and ToolPO reinforcement learning with LLM-simulated APIs and tool-call advantage attribution for fine-grained credit assignment.

Result: DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across eight benchmarks including general tool-use tasks and downstream applications in both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications by enabling autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single reasoning process.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent benchmarks fail to properly evaluate real-world scientific research use cases due to lack of holistic measures, reproducible tools, controlled comparisons, standardized interfaces, and comprehensive baselines.

Method: Developed AstaBench with 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process across multiple domains, including a scientific research environment with production-grade search tools for reproducible evaluation, plus 9 science-optimized agent classes and numerous baselines.

Result: Evaluation of 57 agents across 22 classes revealed that despite progress on individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Conclusion: The paper presents principles and tooling for rigorous agent benchmarking and shows that current AI agents still have significant limitations in performing comprehensive scientific research assistance.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen is the first end-to-end complex multi-ontology matching strategy that generates complete and semantically sound mappings using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and In-Context Learning, outperforming baselines in biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple pairwise ontology matching cannot provide full semantic integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching (CMOM) is needed to align source entities to composite logical expressions of multiple target entities for more nuanced equivalences and provenance.

Method: CMOMgen uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to select relevant classes and filter matching reference mappings as examples for In-Context Learning. It generates complete mappings without restrictions on the number of target ontologies or entities.

Result: CMOMgen outperformed baselines in class selection and achieved minimum 63% F1-score, outperforming all baselines in two out of three biomedical tasks and placing second in the third. Manual evaluation showed 46% of non-reference mappings achieved maximum score.

Conclusion: CMOMgen effectively constructs semantically sound mappings for complex multi-ontology matching, demonstrating the importance of dedicated strategies for comprehensive knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

*Gaku Morio,Harri Rowlands,Dominik Stammbach,Christopher D. Manning,Peter Henderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for analyzing corporate greenwashing in video ads, designed to evaluate vision-language models on detecting environmental framing in energy sector communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand corporate public relations campaigns at scale, especially addressing the mismatch between what companies say and do (greenwashing), using multimodal analysis of video advertisements.

Method: Created an expert-annotated dataset of video ads from Facebook and YouTube with 13 framing types across 50+ companies in 20 countries, specifically designed for vision-language model evaluation.

Result: Baseline experiments show GPT-4.1 achieves 79% F1 score for environmental message detection, while best model achieves only 46% F1 for green innovation framing, revealing challenges in implicit framing and cultural contexts.

Conclusion: The dataset enables multimodal analysis of strategic communication in energy sector, identifying key challenges for VLMs including implicit framing, variable video lengths, and cultural background handling.

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

*Edward Holmberg,Elias Ioup,Mahdi Abdelguerfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Knowledge Graph framework bridges the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs for autonomous agents, enabling adaptive coordination through declarative policy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs that hampers coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces a Knowledge Graph with two-plane architecture that compiles declarative facts into per-agent mission-aware worldviews and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics from domain-agnostic planning.

Result: Case study with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles demonstrates the end-to-end process and shows that different declarative policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes.

Conclusion: Establishes Knowledge Graphs as powerful, stateful orchestrators for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems, not just data repositories.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

### [109] [ROPES: Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20884)
*Pranamya Kulkarni,Puranjay Datta,Burak Varıcı,Emre Acartürk,Karthikeyan Shanmugam,Ali Tajer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROPES introduces an unsupervised causal representation learning framework for robot pose estimation that disentangles controllable latent variables from raw images using only distributional changes from actuator interventions, without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between causal representation learning theory and real-world practice by applying it to robotics, specifically addressing robot pose estimation where interventions naturally occur through actuator commands.

Method: ROPES (Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL) uses interventional causal representation learning to identify controllable latent variables by leveraging variations from actuator interventions, without requiring labeled data.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity to ground truth in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments, outperforming a semi-supervised baseline.

Conclusion: Robot pose estimation serves as a near-practical testbed for causal representation learning, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic suturing is a key long-horizon dexterous manipulation task in surgery, but despite efforts, a fully autonomous suturing pipeline has not been demonstrated on physical hardware. Autonomous suturing represents a critical milestone for robotic autonomy in surgical applications.

Method: The authors propose a goal-conditioned framework that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision and evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models (π₀, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT, multitask ACT) augmented with high-level task-prediction policies.

Result: The goal-conditioned framework improves targeting accuracy by 59-74% over task-only baselines. A high-fidelity dataset of 1,890 suturing demonstrations is released to ensure repeatability and support reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: SutureBot establishes suturing as a benchmark for dexterous imitation learning and supports the development of precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for end-to-end autonomous suturing in surgery.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a

vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.

TL;DR: PPC is a canonicalization framework that maps point clouds to a unique canonical pose to improve robustness against camera pose mismatches in point cloud reinforcement learning for robotic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point Cloud RL mitigates appearance-based brittleness but remains sensitive to camera pose mismatches, undermining reliability in realistic robotic settings.

Method: Proposed PCA Point Cloud (PPC) framework that maps point clouds under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning observations to a consistent frame.

Result: PPC improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks and provides a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Conclusion: PPC effectively addresses viewpoint-induced inconsistencies in PC-RL, enhancing reliability for robotic control applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

*Sai Haneesh Allu,Jishnu Jaykumar P,Ninad Khargonkar,Tyler Summers,Jian Yao,Yu Xiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that enables robots to learn manipulation tasks from human demonstration videos using AR headset data collection, video understanding, trajectory transfer, and optimization modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn manipulation tasks by watching human demonstrations once and then repeat the same tasks in different environments, even when object placements differ from demonstrations.

Method: Four-module system: 1) AR headset data collection for human demonstration videos from robot's viewpoint, 2) Video understanding for object detection and 3D hand trajectory extraction, 3) Human-to-robot trajectory transfer to end-effector reference trajectory, 4) Trajectory optimization in robot configuration space.

Result: The system enables robots to successfully repeat mobile manipulation tasks in different environments after watching human demonstrations once, even with different object placements.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively transfers human demonstration trajectories to robots, allowing one-shot learning of manipulation tasks with generalization to different environments and object configurations.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

*Zlatan Ajanović,Ravi Prakash,Leandro de Souza Rosa,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares two teaching frameworks for robot learning from demonstration: monolithic (entire trajectory) vs. sequential (step-by-step) approaches, finding similar performance but different user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple skills is challenging due to accumulated deviations, distributional shift, and human teacher fatigue, which increases failure chances.

Method: Introduced $(ST)^2$, a sequential method that allows users to define key points and provide incremental demonstrations. Conducted user study with 16 participants on restocking task in retail environment comparing monolithic and sequential approaches.

Result: Both methods achieved similar trajectory quality and success rates. Participants were divided in preference: some preferred sequential for iterative control, others preferred monolithic for simplicity.

Conclusion: While both teaching frameworks perform similarly in terms of trajectory quality and success, user preferences vary based on desired level of control versus simplicity.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

### [115] [Revisiting Replanning from Scratch: Real-Time Incremental Planning with Fast Almost-Surely Asymptotically Optimal Planners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21074)
*Mitchell E. C. Sabbadini,Andrew H. Liu,Joseph Ruan,Tyler S. Wilson,Zachary Kingston,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reactive replanning can be done efficiently using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning algorithms without requiring explicit plan updates, outperforming traditional reactive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactive planning approaches require computationally expensive updates to existing plans when obstacles change, and detecting these changes can be difficult in some applications.

Method: Use fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning algorithms that quickly find initial solutions and converge to optimal ones, treating incremental planning as independent problems rather than updating existing plans. Demonstrated with Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) and Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC).

Result: EIT* found shorter median solution paths than tested reactive planning algorithms in simulations, and AORRTC successfully handled real-world planning on a robot arm.

Conclusion: The assumption that reactive replanning requires updating existing plans can be replaced with more efficient ASAO algorithms that solve planning problems independently, achieving better performance without explicit plan reuse.

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

TL;DR: GSL is a hierarchical policy learning framework that uses object-centric skills to bridge high-level vision-language models and low-level visual-motor policies, achieving superior generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve policy generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation by creating a structured yet flexible hierarchical learning approach that can handle unseen spatial arrangements, object appearances, and task compositions.

Method: Decomposes demonstrations into transferable object-canonicalized skill primitives using foundation models, with skill-object pairs predicted by high-level agents and mapped to world frame execution by low-level modules.

Result: In simulation, GSL trained with only 3 demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30x more data by 15.5% on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses baselines trained with 10x more data.

Conclusion: The GSL framework significantly improves sample efficiency and generalization capabilities in robot manipulation through its object-centric hierarchical skill learning approach.

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

TL;DR: Developed adaptive velocity controllers for modular lunar robots that ensure stable motion alignment using real-time pose measurements, tested in JAXA's lunar simulator with two variants showing predictable motion and millimeter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular robots need controllers that can safely adapt to real-world disturbances for lunar missions, requiring robust motion control that handles mechanical imperfections and sensing noise.

Method: Built on previous actuator synchronization work, developed controllers with dynamic hypersphere clamp that adapt velocity bounds using only real-time end-effector and target pose measurements. Implemented discrete step-based and continuous velocity-based variants.

Result: Step-based variant produced highly predictable, low-wobble motions; continuous variant converged faster with millimeter-level positional accuracy. Both remained robust across limbs with mechanical imperfections like backlash and flex.

Conclusion: The robot-agnostic framework demonstrates flexibility and robustness for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh conditions, suitable for lunar missions.

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address visual degradation challenges in underwater environments caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and feature scarcity that hinder traditional visual-inertial SLAM systems.

Method: Uses tight integration of four sensor modalities with novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy, hybrid tracking strategies, acoustic-inertial-depth joint optimization at frontend, and multi-source hybrid residuals in graph optimization framework.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, demonstrating exceptional robustness in visually challenging underwater environments.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-sensor fusion approach effectively addresses underwater visual degradation challenges and provides reliable SLAM performance even under degraded visual conditions.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer UAVs are widely used by first responders but typically require manual operation by trained pilots, especially in GNSS-denied environments. Autonomous flight could reduce operator strain but existing systems require special interfaces, custom sensors, and powerful computers, limiting deployment.

Method: Developed a system using lightweight consumer-grade DJI drones controlled by an Android app running on the UAV's remote control for state estimation and obstacle avoidance. Includes a ground control station for single operator supervision of multiple heterogeneous UAVs.

Result: The system enables autonomous flight capabilities without requiring special programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, or strong onboard computers. It allows a single operator to configure and supervise multiple UAVs simultaneously.

Conclusion: The presented system facilitates broader deployment of autonomous UAV operations by leveraging consumer-grade hardware and enabling multi-UAV supervision with joint 3D environment modeling, overcoming limitations of traditional autonomous systems.

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of

operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special

which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade

obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple

UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

Motivation: Collapsing terrains in search/rescue missions and planetary exploration pose significant challenges for quadruped robots, requiring safe navigation over unstable surfaces.

Method: Integrates terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion planning, and control strategies using joint measurements to assess terrain stability. Uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize robot motion and a state machine to coordinate terrain probing actions for detecting collapsible regions and adjusting footholds dynamically.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables quadruped robots to safely navigate collapsing terrains through integrated terrain assessment and adaptive motion control without requiring specialized sensors or hardware modifications.

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

TL;DR: PREVENT is a multimodal Behavior Tree system for mobile robotic chemists that uses hierarchical perception with AI and sensory feedback to detect workflow anomalies without false positives/negatives, improving autonomous operation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile robotic chemists lack workflow awareness, making them vulnerable to small anomalies that can disrupt entire workflows, waste resources, and pose safety risks. Existing perception systems generate excessive false positives that require human intervention.

Method: A multimodal Behavior Tree approach with hierarchical perception using AI techniques, Dexterous Vision and Navigational Vision cameras, and IoT gas sensors for execution-related decision-making. The system integrates into existing software with minimal modifications.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed complete avoidance of both false negatives and false positives in simulated risk scenarios. Multi-modal perception achieved higher deployment accuracies than uni-modal skills for both navigation and manipulation.

Conclusion: The PREVENT system provides an efficient solution for workflow anomaly detection in robotic chemistry, enabling reliable autonomous operation without unnecessary workflow interruptions from false alarms.

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

*Domenico Palmisano,Giuseppe Palestra,Berardina Nadja De Carolis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper examines resilience as a key characteristic of social robots, particularly in sensitive contexts like healthcare with elderly populations, where trust is essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes more integrated into sensitive areas like healthcare and education, it's crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust to ensure trust, especially when operating with elderly people who often have low trust in these systems.

Method: The paper defines resilience as the ability to operate under adverse or stressful conditions while maintaining essential operational capabilities, even when degraded or weakened.

Result: The paper establishes that resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots that ensures trust in the robot itself.

Conclusion: Resilience is essential for social robots operating in sensitive contexts, as it enables them to maintain trust by functioning reliably under adverse conditions.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

*Narendhiran Vijayakumar,Sridevi. M*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AURASeg is a ground segmentation model that improves border precision through attention-guided upsampling and residual boundary refinement, achieving better mIoU and F1 scores than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ground segmentation models struggle with fine-grained features in indoor/structured environments due to ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited feature representation.

Method: Uses CSP-Darknet backbone with Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for edge delineation, Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder (APUD) for feature integration, and lightweight ASPP-Lite for multi-scale context extraction.

Result: Achieves +1.26% mIoU and +1.65% segmentation precision improvement over state-of-the-art models on GMRP Dataset and custom Gazebo indoor dataset, with minimal impact on inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed technique is feasible for autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise border refinement while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to pretrain robotic manipulation Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using unscripted real-life human hand videos, treating human hands as dexterous robot end-effectors and creating a large-scale training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing robot training data by leveraging abundant unscripted real-life human hand videos, which cover a wider range of objects, tasks, and environments than traditional robot datasets.

Method: Developed a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach that transforms unannotated egocentric human videos into VLA training data by generating atomic-level hand activity segments with language descriptions, 3D hand motion, and camera motion.

Result: Created a hand-VLA dataset with 1M episodes and 26M frames, showing strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen real-world observations and significant improvement in task success rates when fine-tuned with small amounts of real robot data.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for scalable VLA pretraining using human demonstration data, advancing toward generalizable embodied intelligence for robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

*Elle Miller,Trevor McInroe,David Abel,Oisin Mac Aodha,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops self-supervised learning methods to effectively use sparse binary tactile signals in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation, achieving superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks like ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sensory deficits and reliance on idealized state information in robotic manipulation by incorporating tactile sensing, as current tactile sensing in RL shows inconsistent efficacy.

Method: Developed self-supervised learning methodologies to harness tactile observations using a scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts, with decoupled SSL memory from on-policy memory.

Result: Sparse binary tactile signals proved critical for dexterity, especially for interactions where proprioceptive control errors don't register. Agents achieved superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the importance of tactile sensing for dexterous manipulation and releases the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark to standardize future tactile-based manipulation research.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of structural durability during rough terrain flights and inability to dynamically replan paths when detecting new victims or obstacles in low-cost aerial systems.

Method: Built a fully customized drone from scratch using commonly available components with reinforced lightweight durable frame and onboard control system powered by free open-source software.

Conclusion: Provides an affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions with improved durability and dynamic planning capabilities.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.
