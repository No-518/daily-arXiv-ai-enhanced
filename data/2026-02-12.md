*Leo Thomas Ramos,Angel D. Sappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCSAFNet is a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation that processes visible and non-visible channels separately, uses attention-based fusion, and achieves significant performance gains over existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective land cover segmentation model for multispectral imagery that can handle different spectral configurations (4-channel RGB+NIR and 6-channel with vegetation/water indices) while achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Method: Multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture with dual ConvNeXt encoders for separate processing of visible and non-visible channels, individual decoders for spatial reconstruction, dedicated fusion decoder with multi-scale feature integration, CBAM attention for enhanced fusion, and ASAU activation for stable optimization.

Result: Significant performance improvements: On FBP dataset, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net by +14.72-19.21% and SegFormer by +14.74-19.62% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ by +5.85-6.48% and SegFormer by +4.80-9.11% in mIoU. Compact variants offer good performance with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: MeCSAFNet effectively handles multispectral land cover segmentation with flexible spectral configurations, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, and offers efficient variants suitable for resource-constrained deployment.

Abstract: This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart understanding requires seamless integration of graphical and textual data, but the MLLM-based chart analysis landscape is fragmented and lacks systematic organization, necessitating a structured survey.

Method: Structured survey approach: analyzing fundamental challenges of visual-linguistic fusion in charts, categorizing downstream tasks and datasets with novel taxonomy, presenting comprehensive evolution of methodologies from classic deep learning to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms.

Result: Provides comprehensive roadmap of MLLM-based chart understanding domain, identifies limitations of current models (perceptual and reasoning deficits), and introduces taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Survey aims to equip researchers/practitioners with structured understanding of MLLM transformation in chart information fusion and catalyze progress toward more robust systems through advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.

### [3] [MPA: Multimodal Prototype Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10143)
*Liwen Wu,Wei Wang,Lei Zhao,Zhan Gao,Qika Lin,Shaowen Yao,Zuozhu Liu,Bin Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA is a multimodal few-shot learning framework that enhances prototypes through LLM-based semantic augmentation, hierarchical multi-view augmentation, and adaptive uncertain class absorption, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods focus only on visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, lacking comprehensive multimodal information and rich semantic cues needed for better generalization.

Method: Proposes MPA framework with three components: 1) LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE) for diverse paraphrased category descriptions, 2) Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA) for feature diversity through viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting variations, and 3) Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA) that models uncertainty via interpolation and Gaussian sampling to absorb uncertain samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 single-domain and 6 cross-domain FSL benchmarks show MPA achieves superior performance across most settings. Notably, surpasses second-best method by 12.29% in single-domain and 24.56% in cross-domain settings for 5-way 1-shot tasks.

Conclusion: The MPA framework effectively addresses limitations of existing few-shot learning methods by incorporating multimodal information through semantic enhancement, feature diversity augmentation, and uncertainty modeling, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, few-shot learning (FSL) has become a popular task that aims to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples and has been widely applied in fields such as natural science, remote sensing, and medical images. However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.

### [4] [VERA: Identifying and Leveraging Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads in Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10146)
*Rongcan Pei,Huan Li,Fang Guo,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VERA improves VLMs' long-context understanding by identifying critical Visual Evidence Retrieval heads and using model uncertainty to trigger explicit verbalization of visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with long context and complex reasoning tasks, and the paper aims to understand the internal mechanisms behind these performance bottlenecks.

Method: The paper identifies Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads through attention analysis, then proposes VERA - a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (entropy) to trigger explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads.

Result: VERA yields average relative improvements of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks for long-context understanding.

Conclusion: The discovery of VER heads and the proposed VERA framework significantly enhance VLMs' long-context understanding capabilities without requiring additional training.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in textual understanding, they face significant challenges when handling long context and complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RVMS-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating real-world video memory search with 1,440 samples across 20 categories, featuring hierarchical descriptions and verified human annotations, plus RACLO framework for simulating human recall-search-verify process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, which doesn't reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web.

Method: Created RVMS-Bench with 1,440 samples spanning 20 categories and four duration groups from real-world open-web videos, using hierarchical description framework (Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, Auditory Memory) with human verification. Proposed RACLO agentic framework using abductive reasoning to simulate human "Recall-Search-Verify" cognitive process.

Result: Experiments show existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories.

Conclusion: This work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios by providing a more realistic benchmark and cognitive framework.

Abstract: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, failing to reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web. We present \textbf{RVMS-Bench}, a comprehensive system for evaluating real-world video memory search. It consists of \textbf{1,440 samples} spanning \textbf{20 diverse categories} and \textbf{four duration groups}, sourced from \textbf{real-world open-web videos}. RVMS-Bench utilizes a hierarchical description framework encompassing \textbf{Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, and Auditory Memory} to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with all samples strictly verified via a human-in-the-loop protocol. We further propose \textbf{RACLO}, an agentic framework that employs abductive reasoning to simulate the human ``Recall-Search-Verify'' cognitive process, effectively addressing the challenge of searching for videos via fuzzy memories in the real world. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories. We believe this work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios.

*Ishan Sahu,Somnath Hazra,Somak Aditya,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks on autonomous driving systems cause severe performance drops; proposed lightweight attention-based detector AD² effectively identifies attacks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have made significant progress but their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored, raising serious safety concerns that need to be addressed.

Method: Conducted closed-loop evaluation of Transfuser and Interfuser agents under three black-box adversarial attacks in CARLA: physics-based blur attack, electromagnetic interference attack, and digital ghost object attack. Proposed AD² detection model using attention mechanisms to capture spatial-temporal consistency across multi-camera inputs.

Result: Attacks caused severe vulnerabilities with driving scores dropping up to 99% in worst cases. The proposed AD² detector achieved superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches across multi-camera inputs in CARLA.

Conclusion: Autonomous driving systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. The proposed lightweight attention-based AD² detector effectively addresses these threats with high detection performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have achieved significant progress, yet their adversarial robustness remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

### [7] [ArtisanGS: Interactive Tools for Gaussian Splat Selection with AI and Human in the Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10173)
*Clement Fuji Tsang,Anita Hu,Or Perel,Carsten Kolve,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interactive toolset for selecting and editing objects in 3D Gaussian Splat scenes using AI-assisted 2D-to-3D mask propagation with manual controls for precise segmentation and local editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting usable objects from in-the-wild 3DGS captures is challenging, and existing editing techniques for Gaussian Splat representations are limited, especially for interactive, user-controlled applications.

Method: Interactive suite with AI-driven 2D selection mask propagation to 3DGS, coupled with flexible manual selection tools for binary segmentation, plus user-guided local editing using a custom Video Diffusion Model.

Result: Toolset outperforms state-of-the-art Gaussian Splat selection methods and enables user-controlled local editing without requiring additional optimization for in-the-wild captures.

Conclusion: The interactive selection and editing tools provide direct user control over 3DGS manipulation, enabling practical applications for in-the-wild captures without the need for automatic optimization.

Abstract: Representation in the family of 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) are growing into a viable alternative to traditional graphics for an expanding number of application, including recent techniques that facilitate physics simulation and animation. However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify. Our selection and editing tools can be used for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

### [8] [When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10179)
*Jiacheng Hou,Yining Sun,Ruochong Jin,Haochen Han,Fangming Liu,Wai Kin Victor Chan,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA) is the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that uses purely visual inputs to compromise image editing models, achieving up to 80.9% attack success rate on commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As image editing models shift from text-driven to vision-prompt editing, the attack surface becomes visual, creating underexplored safety risks where malicious instructions can be conveyed through visual inputs like marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts.

Method: Proposes VJA (Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack) that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs, introduces IESBench safety benchmark for evaluation, and develops a training-free defense using introspective multimodal reasoning without auxiliary guard models.

Result: VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models with attack success rates up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. The proposed defense substantially improves safety of poorly aligned models to commercial system levels with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The work exposes new visual vulnerabilities in modern image editing systems, provides both a benchmark (IESBench) and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy image editing, highlighting critical safety risks in vision-prompt paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems. Warning: This paper contains offensive images created by large image editing models.

*El Hadji S. Diop,Thierno Fall,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes geometric group morphological convolutions for DDPMs to improve feature extraction and network equivariance beyond just translation, incorporating rotations, reflections, and permutations through Riemannian manifold operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major limitations in current DDPMs: 1) geometric key feature extraction and 2) network equivariance. Standard DDPMs using U-net architecture are only translation equivariant, lacking equivariance to other Euclidean transformations like rotations and reflections.

Method: Introduce group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds derived from viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type PDEs, acting as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. Add a convection term and solve using method of characteristics to better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to baseline DDPM model, demonstrating better performance with the proposed geometric equivariant approach.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric group morphological convolutions successfully address DDPM limitations by incorporating Euclidean group equivariance (rotations, reflections, permutations) through Riemannian manifold operations, leading to improved performance on standard datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we address two major issues in recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM): {\bf 1)} geometric key feature extraction and {\bf 2)} network equivariance. Since the DDPM prediction network relies on the U-net architecture, which is theoretically only translation equivariant, we introduce a geometric approach combined with an equivariance property of the more general Euclidean group, which includes rotations, reflections, and permutations. We introduce the notion of group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, which are derived from the viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that act as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. We add a convection term to the model and solve it using the method of characteristics. This helps us better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process. Experimental results on the MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to the baseline DDPM model.

*Dominik Galus,Julia Farganus,Tymoteusz Zapala,Mikołaj Czachorowski,Piotr Borycki,Przemysław Spurek,Piotr Syga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XSPLAIN is an ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting classification that provides intuitive explanations without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) lacks interpretability for classification tasks, hindering adoption in critical domains. Existing explainability methods for other 3D representations rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives.

Method: Uses a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone with a novel invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while preserving original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples through "this looks like that" reasoning.

Result: User study (N=51) shows decisive preference: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4% of the time as best, significantly outperforming baselines (p<0.001). No degradation in classification performance while providing transparency and user trust.

Conclusion: XSPLAIN successfully addresses the interpretability gap in 3DGS classification, providing intuitive, prototype-based explanations that users prefer over existing methods while maintaining classification accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a standard for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, yet its adoption in multiple critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability of the generation models as well as classification of the Splats. While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

Method: Created PMMA dataset collected outdoors with volunteers using mobility aids, organized into 9 categories. Benchmarked 7 detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, RT-DETR) and 3 tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, OC-SORT) using MMDetection framework.

Result: YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieved the best detection performance, while differences among the three trackers were relatively small. Dataset and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: The PMMA dataset fills an important gap in pedestrian detection research by focusing on mobility aid users, provides benchmark results for detection and tracking models, and makes both dataset and code publicly available to advance research in this area.

Abstract: This study introduces a new object detection dataset of pedestrians using mobility aids, named PMMA. The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small. The PMMA dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/XJPQUG, and the video processing and model training code is available at https://github.com/DatasetPMMA/PMMA.

*Marin Benčević,Krešimir Romić,Ivana Hartmann Tolić,Irena Galić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed neural networks to predict skin tone from dermatoscopic images, validated against colorimeter measurements, and found severe underrepresentation of darker skin types in public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness auditing of dermatoscopic AI models is limited by lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public datasets, creating performance disparities across skin tones that need to be addressed.

Method: Developed neural networks for Fitzpatrick skin type prediction via ordinal regression and Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets, with extensive pretraining on synthetic and real images.

Result: Fitzpatrick model achieved human-level agreement, ITA predictions showed high concordance with colorimeter measurements, and application to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k revealed less than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI.

Conclusion: The released open-source tool enables rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing, providing first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation validated against colorimeter measurements and supporting evidence of performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

Abstract: Neural-network-based diagnosis from dermatoscopic images is increasingly used for clinical decision support, yet studies report performance disparities across skin tones. Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Applying these estimators to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k, we find that fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI. We release code and pretrained models as an open-source tool for rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing. This is, to our knowledge, the first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation neural network validated against colorimeter measurements, and it supports growing evidence of clinically relevant performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

### [13] [ERGO: Excess-Risk-Guided Optimization for High-Fidelity Monocular 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10278)
*Zehua Ma,Hanhui Li,Zhenyu Xie,Xiaonan Luo,Michael Kampffmeyer,Feng Gao,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO: Adaptive optimization framework for 3D reconstruction from single images using excess risk decomposition to handle noisy synthesized views


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image 3D reconstruction is ill-posed due to missing geometric/textural info in occluded regions. Existing methods use synthesized auxiliary views but these contain inconsistencies and misalignments that propagate artifacts.

Method: ERGO decomposes 3D Gaussian splatting losses into excess risk (suboptimality gap) and Bayes error (irreducible noise). Dynamically estimates view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjusts loss weights. Adds geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives for synergistic global-local optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on Google Scanned Objects and OmniObject3D datasets show ERGO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robustness against supervision noise while enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality.

Conclusion: ERGO effectively harnesses imperfect supervisory signals from synthesized views through adaptive optimization guided by excess risk decomposition, achieving superior 3D reconstruction from single images.

Abstract: Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content.

*Jiaxuan Zhu,Siyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRD is a low-rank defense method that protects Latent Diffusion Models from adversarial attacks by merging LoRA modules with a balance parameter to detect and defend adversarial samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As adversarial attacks on diffusion models become more sophisticated, there's a critical need for defensive strategies to prevent abuse and ensure practical application of these models. Current attack algorithms threaten the reliability of diffusion models, necessitating effective defense mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Defense (LoRD) that combines merging idea with a balance parameter and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules to detect and defend adversarial samples. Builds a defense pipeline that applies learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attacks while maintaining quality on both adversarial and clean samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on facial and landscape images show significantly better defense performance compared to baseline methods. The method ensures LDMs fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images.

Conclusion: LoRD provides an efficient defensive strategy against adversarial attacks on Latent Diffusion Models, demonstrating superior performance over existing baselines while maintaining image generation quality across different domains.

Abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks for diffusion models as well as their fine-tuning process have been developed rapidly. To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.

*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Flow adds uncertainty estimation to flow matching models to assess sample reliability and improve generation quality through uncertainty-guided sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite success of sampling-based generative models like flow matching, they can still produce inconsistent or degraded quality samples. There's a need to assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs.

Method: Proposes UA-Flow, a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts velocity field with heteroscedastic uncertainty. Estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through flow dynamics, then uses uncertainty for classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance.

Result: UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality in image generation experiments.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware flow matching effectively assesses sample reliability and enhances generation quality through uncertainty-guided sampling, offering a practical extension to existing flow matching models.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.

### [16] [Conditional Uncertainty-Aware Political Deepfake Detection with Stochastic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10343)
*Rafael-Petruţ Gardoş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates uncertainty-aware deepfake detection for political content, evaluating how calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates can enable risk-aware moderation policies in high-stakes political contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political deepfakes pose serious risks to information integrity and democratic processes, but existing detectors only provide point predictions without reliability indicators, which is operationally critical in high-stakes political contexts.

Method: The study uses stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical decision-oriented reliability framework. It constructs a politically focused binary image dataset via metadata filtering, fine-tunes pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4), and compares deterministic inference with stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates.

Result: Results show that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware deepfake detection provides valuable operational benefits for political contexts by enabling risk-aware moderation policies, though the systematic analysis reveals both the benefits and limitations of this approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

*Xi Chen,Arian Maleki,Shirin Jalali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGD-MC enables scalable maximum likelihood estimation for digital holography with finite apertures using randomized linear algebra to avoid costly matrix inversions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is theoretically sound for speckle mitigation in coherent imaging but computationally prohibitive for digital holography with finite apertures due to high-dimensional matrix inversion costs, preventing accurate aperture modeling.

Method: Proposed PGD-MC (projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation) uses randomized linear algebra to enable scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions, exploiting sensing matrix structure and conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation.

Result: PGD-MC demonstrates robustness to diverse aperture models, achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography, and outperforms prior Plug-and-Play methods in accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, enabling physically accurate aperture modeling without computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: In coherent imaging, speckle is statistically modeled as multiplicative noise, posing a fundamental challenge for image reconstruction. While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: Open-sourced FDA-cleared deep learning pipelines (AAQ and BMD) for opportunistic CT analysis show clinical accuracy, improving transparency and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of rigorous validation in open-source solutions and lack of transparency in commercial solutions for AI-based imaging biomarkers, leading to unexpected deployment failures.

Method: Developed two fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines within Comp2Comp package: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) for aneurysm size assessment and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) for osteoporosis risk estimation from CT scans.

Result: AAQ achieved mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm) against radiologist measurements on 258 patient scans. BMD showed sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%) against DXA ground truths on 371 patient scans.

Conclusion: Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing improves FDA clearance transparency, enables pre-clinical testing, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models achieve success but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias, with existing mitigation methods overlooking underlying hallucination patterns driven by this bias.

Method: Designs a novel pipeline to synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs), reveals consistent scene-conditioned hallucination patterns, establishes Masked-Object-Hallucination benchmark, and leverages HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Method achieves up to 38% improvement over current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks while effectively mitigating hallucinations and preserving general model capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses language bias hallucinations in VLMs by systematically identifying hallucination patterns through synthesized HIIs and using them for targeted alignment, significantly improving model reliability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse multimodal tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias. Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing change detection methods struggle with capturing long-range dependencies efficiently. Transformers have quadratic complexity issues, and existing linear attention approaches fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships effectively.

Method: Three key components: 1) VTitans - first Titans-based vision backbone integrating neural memory with segmented local attention; 2) Hierarchical VTitans-Adapter for multi-scale feature refinement; 3) TS-CBAM - two-stream fusion module using cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets: 84.36% IoU and 91.52% F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive across LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD datasets.

Conclusion: ChangeTitans successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining the efficiency of Titans architecture with effective spatiotemporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance in remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and related applications. However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that ChangeTitans achieves state-of-the-art results, attaining \textbf{84.36\%} IoU and \textbf{91.52\%} F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR sensors are designed independently from downstream tasks like point cloud registration, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for preprocessing steps like sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning.

Method: Proposes an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters by integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters to balance point density, noise, and sparsity.

Result: Evaluation in CARLA simulation demonstrates that the method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications by improving registration accuracy and efficiency through task-aware sensor optimization.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are a key modality for 3D perception, yet they are typically designed independently of downstream tasks such as point cloud registration. Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.

*Tianxiang Dai,Jonathan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE) lacks physical understanding; this work analyzes it via Point Spread Function, revealing resolution governed by average not finest resolution, and proposes Rotated MHE to reduce anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHE powers neural fields but lacks rigorous physical understanding, leading to heuristic hyperparameter selection. Need analytical framework to characterize spatial behavior and optimize performance.

Method: Analytical approach using Point Spread Function (PSF) as Green's function; derive closed-form PSF approximation; analyze collision-free and finite hash capacity effects; propose Rotated MHE with coordinate rotations per resolution level.

Result: Found grid-induced anisotropy and logarithmic spatial profile; effective resolution determined by average resolution (Navg) not finest (Nmax); collisions cause speckle noise and SNR degradation; R-MHE reduces anisotropy while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Established physics-based methodology to characterize MHE beyond heuristics; Rotated MHE improves anisotropy while preserving original efficiency; provides theoretical foundation for optimizing neural field parameterizations.

Abstract: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.

Abstract: Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

TL;DR: CoLin introduces a novel low-rank complex adapter with only ~1% parameters that outperforms full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning for vision foundation models across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of vision foundation models is prohibitively expensive and inefficient, while existing delta-tuning methods from LLMs don't transfer well to vision tasks, creating a need for more efficient adaptation strategies.

Method: Proposes CoLin (Complex Linear Projection Optimization) with a novel low-rank complex adapter architecture and a tailored loss function to address convergence issues in low-rank composite matrices during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection show CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with only 1% parameters.

Conclusion: CoLin provides a novel and efficient solution for deploying vision foundation models, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter overhead, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation faces challenges due to insufficient training data with limited identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability, making it difficult to achieve comprehensive expressivity including identity preservation, lip synchronization, emotional expression, and lifelike spatial dynamics.

Method: Proposes 3DXTalker with three key components: 1) scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, 2) frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings for lip sync and expression, unified by flow-matching-based transformer, and 3) natural head-pose motion generation with stylized control via prompt-based conditioning.

Result: Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework and achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

Conclusion: 3DXTalker successfully addresses the challenges of expressive 3D talking avatar generation through its comprehensive approach to data curation, audio representation enhancement, and spatial dynamics controllability, enabling more realistic and expressive virtual communication.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

Method: Created MapVerse, a benchmark with 11,837 human-authored QA pairs across 1,025 real-world maps spanning 10 diverse categories, with multiple question types per map for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Evaluated 10 state-of-the-art models: VLMs perform competitively on classification tasks but both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: MapVerse provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning, revealing significant gaps in current models' ability to handle complex spatial reasoning tasks on real-world maps.

Abstract: Maps are powerful carriers of structured and contextual knowledge, encompassing geography, demographics, infrastructure, and environmental patterns. Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

*Hanzhe Yu,Yun Ye,Jintao Rong,Qi Xuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-quality, large-scale dataset of 730k+ images for AI-generated image detection, addressing limitations of existing datasets with diverse generation methods and rich metadata, plus a lightweight noise entropy detection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about AI-generated image authenticity and societal risks; existing detection datasets suffer from limited generalization, low quality, simple prompts, and insufficient diversity.

Method: Created large-scale dataset with 730k+ images using state-of-the-art generation methods (text-to-image, inpainting, refinement, face swapping) with 10k+ carefully designed prompts; proposed lightweight detection method using image noise entropy transformed into entropy tensor of Non-Local Means noise.

Result: Detection models trained on the dataset show superior generalization; the proposed noise entropy method delivers competitive performance; dataset serves as strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods.

Conclusion: The dataset advances robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques and establishes solid baseline for future research; dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.

*Shengyang Sun,Jiashen Hua,Junyi Feng,Xiaojin Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided framework for video anomaly detection using in-context learning for text augmentation and multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion to improve multimodal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text modality is under-explored in video anomaly detection despite providing explicit semantic information that could enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. Current challenges include: general-purpose language models can't capture anomaly-specific nuances, scarcity of relevant text descriptions, and multimodal fusion suffers from redundancy and imbalance.

Method: Two main components: 1) In-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning text feature extractor; 2) Multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, addressing redundancy and imbalance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The proposed text-guided framework successfully leverages text modality for video anomaly detection by addressing key challenges in text feature extraction and multimodal fusion, leading to improved performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection has gained significant attention, yet the potential of the text modality remains under-explored. Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance. Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

*Guanting Ye,Qiyan Zhao,Wenhao Yu,Xiaofeng Zhang,Jianmin Ji,Yanyong Zhang,Ka-Veng Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C²RoPE improves Rotary Position Embedding for 3D multimodal models by addressing spatial continuity loss and long-term attention decay through spatio-temporal continuous positional encoding and Chebyshev causal masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE from LLMs has limitations for multimodal processing: 1) 1D temporal indices disrupt visual feature continuity along columns, causing spatial locality loss; 2) Temporal proximity assumption leads to long-term attention decay where earlier visual tokens get neglected as sequence length increases.

Method: C²RoPE introduces spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding: 1) Combines 1D temporal positions with Cartesian spatial coordinates into triplet hybrid indices; 2) Uses frequency allocation to encode spatio-temporal information across three components; 3) Adds Chebyshev Causal Masking that determines causal dependencies based on Chebyshev distance in 2D space.

Result: Evaluation across various benchmarks including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering demonstrates C²RoPE's effectiveness in improving multimodal processing capabilities.

Conclusion: C²RoPE successfully addresses RoPE's limitations for visual processing by explicitly modeling local spatial continuity and spatial causal relationships, enhancing 3D multimodal model performance on visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaphorStar is a visual RL framework that improves AI's metaphorical comprehension in images, achieving SOTA performance on image implication tasks and enhancing general visual reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with metaphorical comprehension in images due to lack of multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind capabilities needed for nuanced image implications.

Method: Proposes MetaphorStar with three components: TFQ-Data (fine-grained dataset), TFQ-GRPO (visual RL method), and TFQ-Bench (structured benchmark) for end-to-end visual reinforcement learning.

Result: MetaphorStar-32B achieves SOTA on multiple-choice and open-style questions, outperforms Gemini-3.0-pro on true-false questions, with 82.6% average improvement on benchmarks. Learning image implications improves general visual reasoning.

Conclusion: MetaphorStar effectively addresses AI's metaphorical comprehension gap, demonstrates broad applicability through systematic analysis, and all resources are open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

### [32] [Enhancing Underwater Images via Adaptive Semantic-aware Codebook Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10586)
*Bosen Lin,Feng Gao,Yanwei Yu,Junyu Dong,Qian Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUCode is a semantic-aware underwater image enhancement method that uses pixel-level codebook representation to handle inconsistent degradation across different scene components, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater Image Enhancement is ill-posed with no natural clean references, and existing methods fail to address inconsistent degradation across different semantic regions, leading to color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes.

Method: SUCode uses semantic-aware discrete codebook representation with a three-stage training paradigm to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. It employs Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) to integrate channel and frequency cues for color restoration and texture recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics.

Conclusion: SUCode effectively addresses inconsistent degradation in underwater images through semantic-aware codebook representation, providing superior enhancement results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.

Motivation: Need for practical child detection in low-quality surveillance footage for missing child alerts and daycare monitoring, addressing challenges like occlusion, small objects, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting in existing CCTV systems.

Method: Builds on YOLOv11n with domain-specific augmentation strategy synthesizing realistic child placements using spatial perturbations (partial visibility, truncation, overlaps) and photometric degradations (lighting variation, noise), plus Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time for small/occluded instances.

Result: Achieves mAP@0.5 of 0.967 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.783 on Roboflow Daycare dataset, representing absolute improvements of 0.7% and 2.3% over baseline YOLOv11n without architectural changes.

Conclusion: The deployment-ready pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and real-time performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments, with code and augmented dataset publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical and lightweight solution for enhancing child detection in low-quality surveillance footage, a critical component in real-world missing child alert and daycare monitoring systems. Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

Abstract: Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement fine-tuning methods are limited to text domains and haven't been effectively extended to cross-modal, vision-centric domains like medical imaging, which requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning capabilities.

Method: VRFT-Aug introduces training strategies including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation to augment both perception and reasoning while stabilizing the RFT process.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines across multiple medical datasets, and provides generalizable insights and practical training heuristics for medical image tasks.

Conclusion: This work contributes actionable guidance and inspiration for developing reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications by bridging the gap between reinforcement fine-tuning and medical vision tasks.

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in temporal visual reasoning by introducing comprehensive datasets, benchmarks, and a model that synergizes video generation with image understanding for superior performance in dynamic VQA tasks.

Abstract: Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Method: Proposes OmniVL-Guard with two core designs: 1) Self-Evolving CoT Generation to synthesize high-quality reasoning paths and overcome cold-start challenges, and 2) Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO) that dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights to ensure balanced joint optimization between detection and localization tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed balanced reinforcement learning framework effectively addresses the "difficulty bias" problem in omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding, achieving superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenDR-Pix accelerates diffusion-based super-resolution by eliminating VAE bottleneck through pixel-space processing and multi-stage adversarial distillation, achieving 2.8x speedup and 60% memory savings while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve excellent real-world super-resolution but suffer from slow inference and high memory demands. Current solutions like GenDR still face memory limitations requiring tile-by-tile processing, with VAE being the main bottleneck.

Method: Proposes GenDR-Pix which: 1) Replaces VAE with pixel-(un)shuffle operations to work in pixel space, 2) Uses multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove encoder/decoder while avoiding artifacts, 3) Implements random padding for feature augmentation, 4) Adds masked Fourier space loss to penalize amplitude outliers, 5) Integrates padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance.

Result: Achieves 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory savings compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation. Can restore 4K images in 1 second using only 6GB memory, outperforming other one-step diffusion SR methods.

Conclusion: GenDR-Pix successfully addresses the VAE bottleneck in diffusion-based super-resolution, enabling efficient high-resolution image restoration with significant speed and memory improvements while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

TL;DR: A novel VLA framework integrates depth estimation to enhance 3D feature representations, improving spatial understanding and action grounding in robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models rely on 2D image-trained VLMs, limiting spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments.

Method: Integrates depth estimation (VGGT baseline) to extract 3D cues from RGB inputs, adds an action assistant module to constrain 3D representations with action priors, and fuses enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens.

Result: Significantly improves generalization ability and robustness of VLA models, strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios, and leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Shangzhi Xu,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoSTF is a new benchmark framework that systematically measures and stress-tests output repetition failures in VideoLLMs, revealing widespread repetitive degeneration that can be exploited via temporal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs suffer from severe output repetition (self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases/sentences) that isn't captured by existing benchmarks focusing on accuracy and factual correctness. This represents an underexplored failure mode and potential security vulnerability.

Method: Introduces VideoSTF framework with three n-gram-based metrics to formalize repetition, plus a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos and a library of controlled temporal transformations. Conducts pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs.

Result: Output repetition is widespread in VideoLLMs and highly sensitive to temporal perturbations. Simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in black-box settings, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability.

Conclusion: Output repetition is a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs, motivating the need for stability-aware evaluation in video-language systems. The VideoSTF benchmark provides tools to systematically measure and address this problem.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

*Minglei Li,Mengfan He,Chao Chen,Ziyang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: (MGS)² is a geometry-grounded framework for cross-view geo-localization that addresses geometric misalignment between aerial and satellite views through macro-structure filtering and micro-scale adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization is crucial for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but suffers from brittleness due to drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing 2D methods neglect underlying 3D geometry where vertical facades and scale variations corrupt feature alignment.

Method: Proposes (MGS)² with three key components: 1) Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module that uses dilated geometric gradients to filter facade artifacts and enhance view-invariant horizontal planes; 2) Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module that uses depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion; 3) Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss to discriminate against oblique occlusions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with Recall@1 of 97.5% on University-1652 and 97.02% on SUES-200. Demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Conclusion: The geometry-grounded approach effectively addresses the fundamental geometric misalignment problem in cross-view geo-localization, providing robust performance and strong generalization capabilities for UAV navigation applications.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

*Davide Evangelista,Pasquale Cascarano,Elena Loli Piccolomini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes modifications to Deep Generative Prior framework using diffusion models for sparse/limited-angle CT reconstruction, improving quality while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse or limited-angle CT reconstruction is challenging due to artifacts and distortions from missing data. Deep generative models show promise but need improvements within existing frameworks.

Method: Modifies Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework by combining diffusion-based generative models with iterative optimization algorithms for CT reconstruction from sparse sinograms. Focuses on improving image generation, model architecture, and optimization algorithm.

Result: Results show promising reconstruction quality even under highly sparse geometries, though further research is needed.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications to DGP framework with diffusion models offer promising improvements for sparse CT reconstruction while maintaining explainability, but more research is required.

Abstract: The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.

*Yin Wang,Ziyao Zhang,Zhiying Leng,Haitian Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Mu Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MP-HOI is a novel framework for text-driven 3D human-object interaction motion generation that addresses limitations of existing methods through multimodal data priors, enhanced object representation, modality-aware MoE models, and cascaded diffusion with interaction supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-HOI methods suffer from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (1) sub-optimal human motion, (2) unnatural object motion, and (3) weak interaction between humans and objects. These limitations arise from the direct text-to-HOI mapping approach.

Method: MP-HOI introduces four core innovations: (1) Leveraging multimodal data priors (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models; (2) Enhanced object representation with geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties; (3) Multimodal-aware Mixture-of-Experts model for effective feature fusion; (4) Cascaded diffusion framework with interaction supervision for progressive refinement.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions, effectively addressing the three key limitations identified in previous methods.

Conclusion: MP-HOI successfully tackles the challenges of text-driven 3D human-object interaction motion generation by bridging the cross-modality gap through multimodal guidance, enhanced representations, and progressive refinement, resulting in superior motion quality and interaction fidelity.

Abstract: We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

TL;DR: CyclingVQA benchmark evaluates vision-language models for cyclist-centric traffic understanding, revealing gaps in interpreting cyclist-specific cues despite encouraging capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluations are vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception from a cyclist's perspective, despite cyclists facing safety-critical situations in urban traffic.

Method: Introduce CyclingVQA diagnostic benchmark to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from cyclist's perspective; evaluate 31+ recent VLMs including general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models.

Result: Current models show encouraging capabilities but clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, especially interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with correct navigational lanes; driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis identifies recurring failure modes to guide development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems, highlighting limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios.

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

TL;DR: S3 RIQA: A no-reference super-resolution image quality assessment method using self-supervised contrastive learning to handle real-world degradations by learning SR-algorithm-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world super-resolution suffers from complex, unpredictable degradations that differ from synthetic scenarios, making quality assessment challenging and underexplored, especially in data-scarce domains.

Method: Self-supervised contrastive learning framework that pretrains SR model-oriented representations by forming positive pairs from same SR model outputs and negative pairs from different SR models, plus targeted preprocessing and auxiliary tasks for different scaling factors.

Result: S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art metrics on real SR-IQA benchmarks, validated using the new SRMORSS dataset containing various SR algorithms applied to real LR images.

Conclusion: The proposed domain-adaptive, no-reference SR-IQA approach effectively handles real-world degradations by learning SR-algorithm-specific representations, addressing a critical gap in quality assessment for practical super-resolution applications.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

TL;DR: RSHallu: A systematic study addressing hallucinations in remote sensing multimodal LLMs with taxonomy, benchmark, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in remote sensing MLLMs hinder deployment in high-stakes applications like emergency management and agricultural monitoring, but remain under-explored in RS domain.

Method: Three-part approach: (1) Formalize RS hallucinations with RS-oriented taxonomy including image-level inconsistencies; (2) Build hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval with dual-mode checking; (3) Create dataset RSHalluShield for mitigation and propose training-free strategies like decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting.

Result: Mitigation strategies improve hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points across representative RS-MLLMs while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

Conclusion: RSHallu provides comprehensive framework for addressing hallucinations in remote sensing MLLMs through systematic taxonomy, evaluation benchmark, and effective mitigation strategies that balance hallucination reduction with task performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

TL;DR: Training-free frequency modulation method for text-guided diffusion models that preserves structure while enabling semantic modifications by analyzing and manipulating frequency components of noisy latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models suffer from unintended global structure changes when modifying text prompts to achieve semantic adjustments. Current methods rely on empirical feature map selection, leading to suboptimal stability and performance dependence on appropriate selection.

Method: Proposes a training-free frequency modulation method using a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. Analyzes how frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables affects hierarchical emergence of structure framework and fine-grained textures during generation. Directly manipulates noisy latent variable to avoid empirical feature map selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Conclusion: The frequency perspective provides a principled approach to control text-guided diffusion generation, maintaining structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications without requiring training or empirical feature map selection.

Abstract: The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

TL;DR: PP-DNN improves AV perception by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest to reduce computation while maintaining accuracy, achieving predictable real-time inference for multi-tenant DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles face challenges in achieving real-time DNN inference due to the gap between computational requirements and limited onboard resources. Existing approaches focus on model compression, but PP-DNN addresses the fundamental issue of processing excessive image data.

Method: PP-DNN uses an ROI generator to identify critical frames and regions based on frame similarities and traffic scenarios, a FLOPs predictor to estimate computation needs, an ROI scheduler for multi-DNN coordination, and a detection predictor for non-critical frames.

Result: PP-DNN significantly improves perception predictability: increases fusion frames by 7.3x, reduces fusion delay by >2.6x and delay variations by >2.3x, improves detection completeness by 75.4%, and enhances cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over baseline.

Conclusion: PP-DNN provides a novel approach to predictable AV perception by dynamically selecting critical data for processing, effectively bridging the gap between computational demands and limited resources while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

*Yuexiao Ma,Xuzhe Zheng,Jing Xu,Xiwei Xu,Feng Ling,Xiawu Zheng,Huafeng Kuang,Huixia Li,Xing Wang,Xuefeng Xiao,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCache is a caching framework for autoregressive video generation that achieves 2.38-6.7× speedup with minimal quality loss by using chunkwise caching policies and optimized KV cache compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video generation is slow due to sequential chunk processing. Existing caching methods fail because they assume uniform denoising across frames, which doesn't hold for autoregressive models where different chunks have varying similarity patterns at the same timesteps.

Method: FlowCache introduces chunkwise caching policies that allow independent caching decisions per video chunk, adapting to each chunk's unique denoising characteristics. It also uses a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism to maintain fixed memory bounds while preserving quality.

Result: Achieves 2.38× speedup on MAGI-1 and 6.7× speedup on SkyReels-V2 with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively).

Conclusion: FlowCache successfully enables real-time, ultra-long video generation with autoregressive models, establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

Abstract: Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surgical instrument counting is critical for patient safety but remains challenging in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered, as current object detection methods are unordered and struggle with complex arrangements.

Method: Introduces Chain-of-Look framework that mimics human sequential counting by enforcing structured visual chains along spatial trajectories, plus neighboring loss function to model spatial constraints of densely packed instruments. Also presents SurgCount-HD dataset with 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art counting methods (CountGD, REC) and Multimodal Large Language Models (Qwen, ChatGPT) in dense surgical instrument counting tasks.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Look provides an effective solution for accurate surgical instrument counting in dense OR scenarios by incorporating structured visual reasoning and spatial constraints modeling, addressing a critical patient safety need.

Abstract: Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLaVT introduces "chatting with images" framework for LVLMs that uses language-guided feature modulation to enable interactive visual reasoning, addressing limitations of single-pass encoding and improving cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lose fine-grained visual information due to text-only reasoning with single-pass visual encoding, and existing "thinking with images" approaches lack proper linguistic grounding for effective cross-modal alignment, especially for complex spatial reasoning across multiple images.

Method: Proposes "chatting with images" framework with language-guided feature modulation, implemented in ViLaVT model with dynamic vision encoder for joint re-encoding of multiple image regions, trained with two-stage curriculum (supervised fine-tuning + reinforcement learning).

Result: ViLaVT achieves strong improvements across eight benchmarks, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The "chatting with images" paradigm with language-guided feature modulation enables more effective interactive visual reasoning in LVLMs, addressing fundamental limitations of current approaches through tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates.

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: FGAA-FPN: Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection in remote sensing imagery, achieving state-of-the-art results on DOTA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oriented object detection is crucial for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response, but faces challenges from cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches lack explicit foreground modeling and don't leverage geometric orientation priors, limiting feature discriminability.

Method: Proposes FGAA-FPN with hierarchical functional decomposition: 1) Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background in low-level features; 2) Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on DOTA v1.0 (75.5% mAP) and DOTA v1.5 (68.3% mAP) datasets.

Conclusion: FGAA-FPN effectively addresses challenges in oriented object detection by combining foreground guidance and angle-aware attention, demonstrating superior performance through explicit foreground modeling and geometric orientation priors.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility, challenges, and opportunities of geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for high-value ecological applications, as their potential hasn't been fully realized despite being a fast-emerging paradigm.

Method: Fine-tuned two pretrained GFMs (Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind) across three ecological use cases and compared them with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Experiments included LULC generation, forest functional trait mapping, and peatlands detection.

Result: GFMs consistently outperformed baseline ResNet models in all experiments. TerraMind marginally outperformed Prithvi in general, but significantly outperformed both baseline ResNet and Prithvi when using additional modalities. Performance was affected by divergence of input data from pretrained modalities.

Conclusion: GFMs show strong potential for ecological applications but would benefit from higher resolution data and more accurate labels, especially for pixel-level mapping tasks. Careful consideration of input data alignment with pretrained modalities is crucial for optimal performance.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

Motivation: Current preference optimization for diffusion models relies on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as reward providers, which are computationally expensive and suffer from domain mismatch when optimizing latent diffusion generators through pixel-space rewards.

Method: Proposes DiNa-LRM with noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood using diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty, leverages pretrained latent diffusion backbone with timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling for test-time scaling.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines across image alignment benchmarks, achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of computational cost, and improves preference optimization dynamics for faster, more resource-efficient model alignment.

Conclusion: DiNa-LRM provides an effective diffusion-native approach to preference learning that addresses computational efficiency and domain mismatch issues while enabling robust rewarding and improved optimization dynamics.

Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

TL;DR: OccFace is an occlusion-aware facial landmark detection framework that predicts both landmark coordinates and per-point visibility for universal human-like faces, improving robustness under occlusion while maintaining accuracy on visible landmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial landmark detectors struggle with occlusion, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variations and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Current methods typically handle occlusion implicitly without predicting per-point visibility that could benefit downstream applications.

Method: OccFace uses a unified dense 100-point layout with a heatmap-based backbone, adding an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks. The framework also includes an occlusion-aware evaluation suite with new metrics and a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility.

Conclusion: OccFace provides an effective occlusion-aware framework for facial landmark detection that explicitly predicts visibility information, enabling better performance under challenging occlusion scenarios for universal human-like faces.

Abstract: Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

TL;DR: DE-CM improves consistency models by addressing training instability and sampling inflexibility through dual-end optimization and noise-to-noisy mapping, achieving SOTA 1.70 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with one-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency models suffer from training instability and inflexible sampling despite being state-of-the-art for efficient generation. Existing solutions overlook the critical role of trajectory selection in these problems.

Method: Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) selects vital sub-trajectory clusters for stable training, decomposes PF-ODE trajectory into three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets, uses flow matching as boundary regularizer, and introduces noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping to reduce error accumulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on ImageNet 256×256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Conclusion: DE-CM effectively addresses training instability and sampling inflexibility in consistency models through strategic trajectory selection and novel noise-to-noisy mapping, enabling more practical deployment of efficient generative models.

Abstract: The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Abstract: Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation.

Conclusion: The work shows that incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems is essential for handling realistic visual streams with rich temporal dependencies, moving beyond isolated semantic matching to autonomous exploration of visual histories.

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-trained VLMs show better OOD generalization than SFT-trained ones, suggesting RL's implicit data filtering of medium-difficulty samples gives it an advantage.

Method: Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT) explicitly filters training data based on sample difficulty levels, focusing on medium-difficulty samples rather than hard ones.

Result: DC-SFT significantly improves OOD generalization over standard SFT and even surpasses RL-based training, while being more stable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Data difficulty is key to VLM generalization; explicit difficulty filtering via DC-SFT provides a more efficient pathway to robust generalization than RL methods.

Abstract: The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed RGB-only network provides an efficient solution for edge device action recognition without needing auxiliary sensors or computationally expensive pose estimation, achieving practical deployment viability.

Abstract: Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.

TL;DR: First hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with MoP network using band splitting, prototype-based representation, and dual-level routing for adaptive spectral weighting, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visible-light smoke segmentation struggles with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke due to insufficient spectral information. Hyperspectral imaging offers richer spectral data but requires adaptive band weighting strategies.

Method: Mixture of Prototypes (MoP) network with three components: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting.

Result: Superior performance validated through extensive experiments on both hyperspectral (HSSDataset) and multispectral (MSSDataset) modalities, establishing new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging with adaptive band weighting via MoP network effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods, providing robust smoke segmentation for wildfire management and industrial safety.

Abstract: Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

*Darakshan Rashid,Raza Imam,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STRIDE-Net improves fairness in chest X-ray classification by learning disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations through patch-level masking and adversarial confusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising clinical safety and equity concerns. Existing debiasing methods yield inconsistent improvements or degrade overall diagnostic utility by treating fairness as a post hoc constraint.

Method: STRIDE-Net uses a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. It enforces semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport to anchor representations in clinical semantics.

Result: Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups, STRIDE-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy across ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: STRIDE-Net achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches by learning demographically invariant representations at the patch level with semantic alignment to clinical concepts.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

TL;DR: Chart Specification improves chart-to-code generation by using structured intermediate representations and reinforcement learning with fine-grained structural feedback, achieving state-of-the-art results with high data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for chart-to-code generation rely on supervised fine-tuning that encourages surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, leading to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs.

Method: Proposes Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. It filters syntactic noise to construct structurally balanced training sets and uses Spec-Align Reward for fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on three public benchmarks. With only 3K training samples, achieves strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks. Scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: Precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation, demonstrating that structured intermediate representations with fine-grained feedback mechanisms significantly improve performance and data efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches.

TL;DR: TR-World focuses on dynamic object modeling using temporal residuals to extract motion information without detection/tracking, combined with FGTR for trajectory refinement using future BEV features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for autonomous driving have redundant modeling of static regions and lack deep interaction with trajectories, limiting their effectiveness in planning accuracy.

Method: Proposes Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World) that extracts dynamic object information via temporal residuals of scene representations, and Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module that interacts prior trajectories with future BEV features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets, with code publicly available.

Conclusion: TR-World with FGTR effectively models dynamic objects and refines trajectories using future information, improving autonomous driving planning accuracy while preventing world model collapse.

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

### [72] [FastUSP: A Multi-Level Collaborative Acceleration Framework for Distributed Diffusion Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10940)
*Guandong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastUSP: Multi-level optimization framework for distributed diffusion model inference that addresses kernel launch overhead and communication inefficiencies in Unified Sequence Parallelism, achieving 1.09×-1.16× speedup over baseline USP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large diffusion models like FLUX (12B) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B) require multi-GPU parallelism, but existing Unified Sequence Parallelism implementations suffer from excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling, limiting inference efficiency.

Method: FastUSP integrates three optimization levels: (1) compile-level optimization with graph compilation (CUDA Graphs) and computation-communication reordering, (2) communication-level optimization with FP8 quantized collective communication, and (3) operator-level optimization with pipelined Ring attention using double buffering.

Result: On FLUX (12B), FastUSP achieves 1.12×-1.16× end-to-end speedup over baseline USP across 2-8 GPUs, with compile-level optimization providing dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves 1.09× speedup on 2 GPUs, but faces PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitations with Ring attention on 4-8 GPUs.

Conclusion: Kernel launch overhead, not communication latency, is the primary bottleneck for distributed diffusion inference on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects. FastUSP's multi-level optimization approach effectively addresses these inefficiencies, though framework compatibility issues with certain attention mechanisms remain a challenge.

Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

TL;DR: VFGS-Net: A retinal vessel segmentation network integrating frequency-aware enhancement, dual-path convolution, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling to better capture fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative analysis and computer-aided diagnosis, but existing methods struggle with elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast, making it difficult to preserve fine capillaries while maintaining global topological continuity.

Method: VFGS-Net integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling. It uses a dual-path feature convolution module for local textures and multi-scale context, vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention to reweight spectral components, and a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block for long-range dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public retinal vessel datasets show competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions.

Conclusion: VFGS-Net demonstrates robustness and clinical potential by effectively addressing the challenges of retinal vessel segmentation through its integrated approach of frequency-domain enhancement and global spatial modeling.

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

TL;DR: DFIC dataset with 58K annotated images and 2,706 videos of 1,000+ subjects enables automated ICAO compliance verification for MRTDs using spatial attention models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of facial images for ISO/IEC and ICAO compliance in machine-readable travel documents is inefficient for high-demand environments, requiring automated verification methods.

Method: Created DFIC dataset with diverse compliant/non-compliant facial images and videos, then fine-tuned a novel spatial attention-based model for automatic ICAO compliance validation.

Result: The spatial attention model trained on DFIC outperformed state-of-the-art ICAO compliance verification methods, with the dataset offering better demographic balance than existing public datasets.

Conclusion: DFIC dataset enables improved automated ICAO compliance verification and can enhance security, privacy, and fairness in facial recognition systems across various applications.

Abstract: Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance but their attention mechanisms are opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors, lacking interpretability.

Method: Adapts previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to ViT architecture with geometrically grounded formulation, using interpretability indicators to monitor attention dynamics during training.

Result: SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SVDA establishes a comprehensive tool for analyzing structured attention models, laying foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention mechanisms in modern Transformer architectures remain opaque, limiting interpretability in critical applications like robotics, AR, and autonomous driving where understanding model decisions is important.

Method: Introduces SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions to decouple directional alignment from spectral modulation, creating intrinsically interpretable attention maps.

Result: SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy on KITTI and NYU-v2 datasets with minor computational overhead, while unlocking six spectral indicators that reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in attention organization.

Conclusion: SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation by shifting attention from an opaque mechanism to a quantifiable descriptor, opening a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Motivation: Existing query-based 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from query initialization problems due to sparse point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in decoders.

Method: Proposes hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer from superpoints, and coordinate-guided state space model decoder with local aggregation and spatial dual-path SSM blocks for efficient query refinement.

Result: Achieves 1st place on ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard with 2.5% mAP improvement over previous best method using only 1/3 FLOPs. Also shows competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks.

Conclusion: LaSSM demonstrates superior efficiency and performance for large-scale 3D scene instance segmentation by addressing query initialization and computational bottlenecks through novel hierarchical initialization and SSM-based decoding.

Abstract: Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM.

Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing.

TL;DR: The First International StepUP Competition for biometric footstep recognition used the new UNB StepUP-P150 dataset to develop robust models, with top team achieving 10.77% EER using GRM optimization, but generalization to unfamiliar footwear remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric footstep recognition has potential for security applications but lacks large, diverse datasets to address generalization challenges like new users, footwear variations, and walking speed shifts.

Method: Organized a competition where teams developed recognition models using the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset (largest footstep pressure dataset), then evaluated on a separate test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations with limited reference data.

Result: 23 teams participated globally; top team (Saeid_UCC) achieved best equal error rate of 10.77% using generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy; competition showcased strong solutions but revealed persistent generalization challenges.

Conclusion: The competition marked progress in footstep biometrics using the new StepUP-P150 dataset, but generalization to unfamiliar footwear remains a critical challenge for future research.

Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastFlow is a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates flow-matching models by identifying and skipping denoising steps that make minor adjustments, achieving over 2.6x speedup while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models have state-of-the-art fidelity but are slow due to sequential denoising. Existing acceleration methods are static, require retraining, and don't generalize well across tasks.

Method: FastFlow identifies denoising steps that make minor adjustments and approximates them using finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions instead of full neural network computations. It models step-skipping decisions as a multi-armed bandit problem to learn optimal skips.

Result: Experiments show over 2.6x speedup while maintaining high-quality outputs across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines.

Conclusion: FastFlow provides an effective adaptive inference framework that accelerates flow-matching models without retraining, generalizes across tasks, and maintains output quality while significantly improving speed.

Abstract: Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairWeaver is a diffusion-based pipeline that animates single human images with realistic hair dynamics using specialized LoRA modules for motion control and domain preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods successfully control body pose but lack specific control over hair, resulting in stiff and unrealistic hair animations that fail to capture intricate hair motions.

Method: Uses two specialized modules: Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve photoreal appearance across domains. These lightweight components guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining generative capabilities. Trained on specialized dataset of dynamic human motion from CG simulator.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details and fine control over hair motion.

Conclusion: HairWeaver sets a new standard for realistic hair animation by overcoming limitations of existing methods through specialized motion control and domain adaptation modules.

Abstract: We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCritic is a multimodal critic model specialized for physical AI tasks, using a two-stage RLVR pipeline with physical skill warmup and self-referential critic finetuning to improve judgment stability and physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal critics are trained primarily for general visual tasks (captioning, image QA), leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning underexplored. There's a need for reliable judge models specifically optimized for physically grounded evaluation.

Method: Two-stage RLVR pipeline: 1) Physical skill warmup stage enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, 2) Self-referential critic finetuning where the critic generates its own prediction as internal reference before judging candidate responses.

Result: PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks. When applied as a policy model, it further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

Conclusion: PhyCritic demonstrates that specialized critic models for physical AI can outperform general-purpose critics, and the self-referential approach improves judgment stability and physical correctness, enabling better evaluation and alignment for physically grounded tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

Motivation: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows are crucial for transfer processes but difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques have limitations near moving interfaces, and existing neural rendering methods can't handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces.

Method: Integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and uses a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations.

Result: Evaluated on new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

Conclusion: SurfPhase enables effective 3D reconstruction of interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows from sparse camera views, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations.

TL;DR: AlphaEvolve discovers interpretable models showing frontier LLMs exhibit deeper strategic reasoning than humans in iterated rock-paper-scissors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, understanding where and why their behavior diverges from humans is critical. Existing behavioral game theory models don't fully capture idiosyncratic human behavior or black-box LLM behavior.

Method: Use AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving behavior. Analysis conducted on iterated rock-paper-scissors.

Result: Frontier LLMs demonstrate capability for deeper strategic behavior than humans in iterated rock-paper-scissors. The approach successfully reveals structural differences in strategic reasoning between humans and LLMs.

Conclusion: The results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving behavioral divergences between humans and LLMs in strategic interactions, with implications for deploying LLMs in social and strategic contexts.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.

*Zhiling Yan,Dingjie Song,Zhe Fang,Yisheng Ji,Xiang Li,Quanzheng Li,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveMedBench: A continuously updated, contamination-free medical benchmark using real-world clinical cases with automated rubric-based evaluation, revealing LLMs struggle with contextual application (35-48% failures) and suffer from data contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks have critical limitations: data contamination (test sets leaking into training), temporal misalignment (not capturing rapid medical knowledge evolution), and inadequate evaluation metrics (shallow lexical overlap or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring).

Method: 1) LiveMedBench: Continuously updated benchmark harvesting real-world clinical cases weekly from online medical communities with strict temporal separation. 2) Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework: Filters noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based principles. 3) Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework: Decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria for objective assessment.

Result: Benchmark includes 2,756 real-world cases across 38 specialties with 16,702 evaluation criteria. Evaluation of 38 LLMs shows best model achieves only 39.2% accuracy, 84% of models degrade on post-cutoff cases (confirming contamination risks), and 35-48% of failures stem from inability to apply knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

Conclusion: LiveMedBench addresses critical gaps in medical LLM evaluation by providing contamination-free, temporally aligned assessment. Results reveal contextual application-not factual knowledge-is the dominant bottleneck, highlighting the need for benchmarks that test practical clinical reasoning rather than memorization.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Found-RL is a platform that efficiently integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving, using asynchronous batch inference to overcome VLM latency bottlenecks and novel supervision mechanisms to distill VLM knowledge into lightweight RL policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is sample inefficient and lacks semantic interpretability for autonomous driving, while VLMs offer rich context-aware knowledge but have high inference latency that prevents real-time integration with RL training loops.

Method: Asynchronous batch inference framework decouples VLM reasoning from simulation; Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) distill VLM action suggestions; CLIP with Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment addresses dynamic blindness for dense reward shaping.

Result: Lightweight RL model achieves near-VLM performance compared to billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (~500 FPS), effectively bridging the performance-latency gap.

Conclusion: Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for efficient VLM-RL integration in autonomous driving, demonstrating that lightweight RL models can achieve expert-level performance with real-time inference capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.

*Jihwan Oh,Murad Aghazada,Yooju Shin,Se-Young Yun,Taehyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgoraBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in bargaining scenarios, with utility-based metrics and a human-preference dataset to improve LLM negotiation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with bargaining due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these limitations.

Method: Developed AgoraBench with nine challenging bargaining settings, created human-aligned utility-based metrics (agent utility, negotiation power, acquisition ratio), and built a human preference dataset with learning pipeline for both prompting and finetuning.

Result: Baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while the proposed mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.

Conclusion: The utility feedback framework with AgoraBench and human-preference grounded metrics effectively addresses LLMs' bargaining limitations and improves their negotiation capabilities.

Abstract: Bargaining is often regarded as a logical arena rather than an art or a matter of intuition, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to navigate it due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors. Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.

TL;DR: LLMs can generate QNP abstractions for generalized planning when guided by automated debugging to fix abstraction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for generalized planning problems and develop methods to fix abstraction errors automatically.

Method: Proposed a prompt protocol where LLMs generate abstract features and QNP abstractions from GP domains and training tasks, combined with automated debugging to detect and fix abstraction errors.

Result: Experiments show that with proper guidance from automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions for generalized planning.

Conclusion: LLMs can function as effective QNP abstraction generators when supported by automated debugging methods to correct abstraction errors.

Abstract: Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) serves as an important abstraction model for generalized planning (GP), which aims to compute general plans that solve multiple instances at once. Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.

*Bo Xue,Yunchong Song,Fanghao Shao,Xuekai Zhu,Lin Chen,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FoSS is a GFlowNets framework for span generation that creates dynamic span vocabularies from retrieved text, enabling DAG-structured exploration of diverse compositional paths for improved text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive models have fixed vocabularies and tree-structured state spaces, limiting flexibility. Recent dynamic vocabulary approaches using retrieved spans overlook that sentences can be composed of varying-length spans, lacking explicit DAG modeling, which restricts exploration and creates path bias.

Method: FoSS constructs dynamic span vocabularies by flexibly segmenting retrieved text, ensuring a DAG-structured state space. This allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. Specialized reward models guide the generation of diverse, high-quality text.

Result: FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments show FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora.

Conclusion: FoSS successfully addresses limitations of tree-structured language models by introducing a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation with DAG-structured state spaces, enabling better exploration of compositional paths and improved text generation quality and diversity.

Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.

*Shuai Han,Mehdi Dastani,Shihan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NSAM is a neuro-symbolic framework that automatically learns symbolic models from high-dimensional states during DRL training to mask infeasible actions, improving sample efficiency and reducing constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL approaches require manually specified action masking and assume consistent symbolic representations, which limits their applicability in complex domains with constraints.

Method: NSAM automatically learns symbolic models consistent with domain constraints from high-dimensional states in a minimally supervised manner during DRL, then uses these models to generate action masks that filter infeasible actions.

Result: NSAM significantly improves DRL sample efficiency while substantially reducing constraint violations across multiple domains with constraints.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic integration in NSAM enables mutual reinforcement between symbolic grounding and policy learning, providing an effective approach for constraint-aware DRL without manual specification.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may explore infeasible actions during training and execution. Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.

*Nanxu Gong,Haotian Li,Sixun Dong,Jianxun Lian,Yanjie Fu,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning models don't consistently outperform non-reasoning models on Theory of Mind tasks, revealing issues with long reasoning chains, option-matching shortcuts, and poor transfer from formal to social reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the step-by-step reasoning capabilities that have improved performance in mathematics and coding for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) also transfer to socio-cognitive skills like Theory of Mind, which is essential for natural social interaction.

Method: Systematic study of nine advanced LLMs comparing reasoning vs. non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks, with fine-grained analysis, option removal experiments, and intervention approaches (Slow-to-Fast adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match shortcut prevention).

Result: Reasoning models don't consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. Key findings: 1) Accuracy drops with longer responses and larger reasoning budgets, 2) Constrained reasoning helps but requires dynamic adaptation, 3) Models rely on option-matching shortcuts rather than genuine deduction (performance improves when options removed).

Conclusion: Advancements in LRMs for formal reasoning (math, code) don't fully transfer to Theory of Mind tasks. Achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods, addressing issues with reasoning length, adaptive reasoning, and shortcut prevention.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

TL;DR: HARPO is a new RL method that balances learning across heterogeneous behavioral tasks and samples, used to create Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 foundation model that outperforms existing behavioral models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches model human behavioral dimensions in isolation, which increases training costs and limits generalization. Recent unified models don't explicitly handle heterogeneous behavioral data.

Method: Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO) modulates advantages during policy optimization to ensure no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence, balancing learning across heterogeneous tasks and samples.

Result: Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves strongest performance across behavioral tasks with gains up to +16.85% on multitask and +9.37% on held-out settings, producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. HARPO outperforms recent RL methods.

Conclusion: HARPO effectively addresses heterogeneity in behavioral data, enabling development of superior foundation models for social behavior processing with better generalization and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.

*Jie Jiang,Yangru Huang,Zeyu Wang,Changping Wang,Yuling Xiong,Jun Zhang,Huan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-STAR addresses probability-reward mismatch in RL-finetuned generative recommendation by combining value-guided tree search with sibling-relative advantage learning to improve exploration and reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning generative recommendation models with RL suffers from probability-reward mismatch where conventional decoding methods exhibit myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, causing insufficient exploration (high-reward items in low-probability branches get pruned) and advantage compression (trajectories sharing prefixes get correlated rewards with low variance).

Method: V-STAR framework with two components: 1) Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) identifies decisive nodes and selectively deepens high-potential prefixes to improve exploration without exhaustive search, and 2) Sibling-GRPO exploits tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages, concentrating learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Result: Extensive experiments on offline and online datasets show V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: V-STAR effectively addresses the probability-reward mismatch in RL-finetuned generative recommendation through a synergistic combination of value-guided tree search and sibling-relative advantage learning, enabling better exploration and more informative reward signals.

Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI adoption is growing in higher education but stakeholder perceptions remain divided, and EU AI Act requires regulatory compliance, creating need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to specific disciplinary needs.

Method: Mixed-method approach surveying 61 staff and 37 students at Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE), University of Oulu, to investigate GenAI perceptions within these specific disciplines.

Result: Revealed both shared and discipline-specific themes: strong interest in programming support from GenAI, but concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Identified high-level requirements for responsible integration.

Conclusion: Proposes conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration emphasizing stakeholder engagement. Provides practical guidance for universities to harness GenAI while addressing concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance, with discipline-specific requirements reinforcing importance of stakeholder involvement.

Abstract: Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: ScratchWorld is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal AI agents on Scratch programming tasks through GUI interactions, revealing a significant gap between program reasoning and fine-grained GUI manipulation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of benchmarks for evaluating AI agents' ability to construct programs through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in block-based programming environments like Scratch, which are central to low-code education.

Method: Created ScratchWorld benchmark with 83 tasks across Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute categories based on Use-Modify-Create framework. Uses two interaction modes: primitive mode (drag-and-drop) for visuomotor control assessment, and composite mode (semantic APIs) to separate program reasoning from GUI execution. Includes execution-based evaluation protocol for functional correctness.

Result: Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multimodal models and GUI agents show a substantial reasoning-acting gap - agents have strong planning capabilities but struggle with fine-grained GUI manipulation.

Conclusion: ScratchWorld provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents in Scratch programming, revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong program reasoning abilities, highlighting the need for improved visuomotor control in AI agents.

Abstract: Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.

TL;DR: SynergyKGC is an adaptive framework that addresses structural resolution mismatch in Knowledge Graph Completion by reconciling divergent representational demands across varying graph densities through cross-modal synergy and density-dependent identity anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods suffer from "structural resolution mismatch" - they fail to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, leading to structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions.

Method: SynergyKGC advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert using relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. It couples a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture to reconcile topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability.

Result: Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of SynergyKGC in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

Conclusion: SynergyKGC effectively addresses the structural resolution mismatch problem in KGC by adaptively reconciling topological heterogeneity while maintaining representational stability, offering a generalized approach for resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

TL;DR: RLCER is a reinforcement learning method that uses self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics to reward chain-of-thought reasoning without human annotation, outperforming outcome-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly rewarding chain-of-thought reasoning is difficult due to heavy human labeling requirements, static reward models struggling with evolving CoT distributions, and reward hacking problems. There's a need for autonomous CoT rewarding that requires no human annotation and can evolve gradually.

Method: RLCER (Reinforcement Learning with CoT Supervision via Self-Evolving Rubrics) enhances outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. The method uses self-evolving training approaches to create rubrics that provide reliable CoT supervision signals without outcome rewards.

Result: RLCER outperforms outcome-centric RLVR. Additionally, when used as in-prompt hints, the self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

Conclusion: Self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide effective supervision for chain-of-thought reasoning without human annotation, enabling better performance than outcome-centric approaches and offering additional benefits when used as in-prompt hints during inference.

Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

*F. Carichon,R. Rampa,G. Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations in cooking recipes, unlike humans whose recipe divergence correlates with cultural distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for cultural content creation but exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and erasure of culturally specific expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond dominant ones remains a critical challenge.

Method: Study cultural adaptation in LLMs through cooking recipes using the GlobalFusion dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to cultural distance measures. Generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs using the same country pairs, enabling direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation.

Result: LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations - their generated recipe divergence does not correlate with cultural distance (unlike humans). Cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, models inflate novelty by misunderstanding creativity/tradition concepts, and they fail to identify adaptations with associated countries or ground them in culturally salient elements like ingredients.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations for culturally oriented generation, with important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications. Models cannot meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond dominant ones.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

TL;DR: CLI-Gym: A pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks by simulating environment histories, generating 1,655 tasks for agent training, with fine-tuned model LiberCoder achieving +21.1% improvement on Terminal-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic coding requires effective interaction with runtime environments (like CLI) for tasks like dependency resolution and system fixes, but there's a lack of scalable methods to obtain environment-intensive tasks for enhancing agent capabilities.

Method: Based on analogy between Dockerfile and agentic tasks, agents simulate and explore environment histories guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of healthy environments, states are inverted to earlier buggy versions, then tasks are derived by packing buggy states with error messages.

Result: Generated 1,655 environment-intensive tasks (largest collection of its kind). Fine-tuned model LiberCoder achieved +21.1% absolute improvement (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines.

Conclusion: CLI-Gym provides the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks, enabling significant improvement in agent performance on terminal-based tasks through curated successful trajectories and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Agentic coding requires agents to effectively interact with runtime environments, e.g., command line interfaces (CLI), so as to complete tasks like resolving dependency issues, fixing system problems, etc. But it remains underexplored how such environment-intensive tasks can be obtained at scale to enhance agents' capabilities. To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: GameDevBench: First benchmark for evaluating multimodal coding agents on complex game development tasks requiring deep understanding of code and visual assets, with agents struggling and simple multimodal feedback methods improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal coding agents lag behind text-only counterparts due to lack of evaluation testbeds combining software complexity with multimodal understanding. Game development provides ideal testbed requiring navigation of large codebases while manipulating visual assets like shaders, sprites, and animations.

Method: Created GameDevBench with 132 tasks from web/video tutorials requiring significant multimodal understanding. Tasks are complex (3x more code/file changes than prior benchmarks). Introduced two simple image/video-based feedback mechanisms for agents to improve multimodal capability.

Result: Best agent solved only 54.5% of tasks. Strong correlation between task difficulty and multimodal complexity - success rates dropped from 46.9% (gameplay tasks) to 31.6% (2D graphics). Simple multimodal feedback improved performance, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 increasing from 33.3% to 47.7%.

Conclusion: GameDevBench addresses critical gap in multimodal agent evaluation, revealing current limitations in game development tasks. Simple multimodal feedback mechanisms show promise for improving agent performance. Benchmark released publicly to support further research in agentic game development.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

TL;DR: FVeriChain is a neuro-symbolic framework that uses LLMs to translate natural language requirements into formal specifications for verifying agent safety, providing mathematical guarantees instead of probabilistic scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents operate in high-stakes domains requiring behavioral safety, but current LLM-as-a-Judge oversight faces a dilemma: probabilistic systems can't reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes. Formal verification offers a principled solution but is hindered by the bottleneck of translating natural language to formal specifications.

Method: FVeriChain employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture where LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 SMT solving.

Result: Experiments on 7 agent models show FVeriChain achieves 16.6% average improvement over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization (7B judge achieves >90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents), and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.

Conclusion: FVeriChain bridges the gap between natural language requirements and formal verification, offering mathematical guarantees for LLM agent safety rather than probabilistic scores, and demonstrates superior performance across behavioral safety, constraint adherence, and deception detection benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents increasingly operate in high-stakes domains with real-world consequences, ensuring their behavioral safety becomes paramount. The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.

TL;DR: Real-time autonomous driving framework using conditional flow matching with adaptive inference steps and trajectory post-processing for smooth, constraint-aware planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like diffusion models have high latency (hundreds of denoising steps), while consistency models require expensive retraining to adjust noise schedules for multimodal driving distributions. Need real-time, adaptive planning without retraining overhead.

Method: Conditional flow matching framework that jointly predicts surrounding agent motions and plans ego trajectory. Includes lightweight variance estimator for adaptive inference steps (no retraining needed) and convex quadratic program post-processing for ride quality.

Result: Achieves 20 Hz update rate on RTX 3070 GPU, handles maneuvers like lane changes, cruise control, and unprotected left turns without scenario-specific tuning. Outperforms transformer, diffusion, and consistency models in trajectory smoothness and dynamic constraint adherence.

Conclusion: Proposed flow matching framework enables real-time autonomous driving with adaptive inference and minimal post-processing, balancing runtime and performance without expensive retraining.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reasoning about interactions with surrounding traffic. A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop framework for robot failure recovery that uses module-level uncertainty and human intervention cost models to decide when and which module to query, reducing user workload while improving recovery success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in unstructured human environments often fail, especially in caregiving scenarios. While humans can help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on human partners.

Method: A modular policy framework that separates two decisions: (1) module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure using calibrated uncertainty estimates, and (2) querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously based on human intervention cost models.

Result: The framework improves recovery success while reducing user workload in robot-assisted bite acquisition systems tested with individuals having both emulated and real mobility limitations. Controlled experiments reveal trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness, and workload.

Conclusion: Explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort enables more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots, balancing recovery success with reduced human workload.

Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

TL;DR: Trajectory planning method using composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems in complex environments, with symbolic optimization for continuous paths and obstacle avoidance via cost surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient trajectory planning for autonomous systems (ground, aerial, underwater, space) that can handle complex environments with obstacles while maintaining continuity, safety, and computational efficiency, especially for systems with limited onboard resources.

Method: Uses composite Bernstein polynomials in symbolic optimization framework to plan trajectories over continuous cost surfaces where obstacles are encoded as high-cost regions. Incorporates three constraint types: Gaussian surface inequality for obstacle clearance, geodesic equations for efficient path direction, and boundary constraints for start/end conditions.

Result: Efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in multi-obstacle scenarios with precise clearance control, without extensive sampling or post-processing. Enables continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories suitable for various autonomous systems including spacecraft maneuvers.

Conclusion: The composite Bernstein polynomial approach provides an effective trajectory planning method that balances computational efficiency with precise control over path shape and safety, suitable as both standalone planner and initializer for more complex motion planning problems.

Abstract: This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legged locomotion learning relies on geometric representations, limiting robots' ability to respond to higher-level semantics like human instructions. Need to bridge this gap between low-level control and high-level reasoning.

Method: 1) Use pre-trained LLM to synthesize instruction-grounded skill database for legged robots. 2) Employ pre-trained VLM to extract environmental semantics and ground them in skill database for real-time skill advisories. 3) Train style-conditioned policy to generate diverse, robust locomotion skills with high style fidelity.

Result: Achieves 87% instruction-following accuracy without needing online queries to cloud-based foundation models. Demonstrates real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning.

Conclusion: Successfully integrates foundation models for semantic-aware legged locomotion, enabling robots to respond to human instructions and environmental semantics in real-time, representing significant advancement beyond geometric-only approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in legged locomotion learning are still dominated by the utilization of geometric representations of the environment, limiting the robot's capability to respond to higher-level semantics such as human instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates high-level commonsense reasoning from foundation models into the process of legged locomotion adaptation. Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.

TL;DR: LifeLong-RFT: A reinforcement fine-tuning method for Vision-Language-Action models that uses multi-dimensional process rewards to enable efficient lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for VLA models requires large task-specific datasets and suffers from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their adaptability and lifelong learning capabilities.

Method: Proposes LifeLong-RFT with Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism that combines three reward components: Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) for discrete action accuracy, Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) for precise control alignment, and Format Compliance Reward (FCR) for output structure validity.

Result: Achieves 22% gain in average success rate over SFT on LIBERO benchmark for continual learning, adapts to new tasks using only 20% of training data, and shows strong performance across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: LifeLong-RFT provides an effective post-training paradigm for VLAs that enables lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting, requiring significantly less data than SFT while maintaining strong multi-task performance.

Abstract: Pretrained on large-scale and diverse datasets, VLA models demonstrate strong generalization and adaptability as general-purpose robotic policies. However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs.

TL;DR: Two quadruped robots synchronize to jump 1.5m high (144% improvement over solo jumps) using decentralized reinforcement learning without communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual robots are limited by physical actuation constraints; cooperative jumping can transcend these boundaries and enable superior performance beyond solo capabilities.

Method: Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) with progressive curriculum strategy to overcome sparse-reward challenges in mechanically coupled systems, using only proprioceptive feedback without explicit communication.

Result: Robust simulation performance and successful hardware transfer achieving multi-directional jumps onto 1.5m platforms, with one robot reaching 1.1m foot-end elevation (144% improvement over solo 0.45m jumps).

Conclusion: Demonstrates communication-free collaborative locomotion through precise proprioceptive coordination, establishing foundation for cooperative tasks in constrained environments.

Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

*Yanchen Liu,Yuang Fan,Minghui Zhao,Xiaofan Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive multi-sensor fusion that dynamically adjusts sensor configurations (frequency, resolution, range) based on environmental conditions to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic perception systems use static sensor configurations that waste bandwidth, computation, and energy by collecting all modalities at fixed rates regardless of situational utility, preventing prioritization of sensors under challenging conditions like poor lighting or occlusion.

Method: A closed-loop framework unifies sensing, learning, and actuation: a detection backbone extracts multi-spectral features and produces contribution scores for each modality, which an RL agent uses to dynamically adjust sensor configurations (sampling frequency, resolution, range) in real-time.

Result: Implementation on a mobile rover shows adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3% with only a 5.3% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms by enabling dynamic sensor reconfiguration based on environmental conditions.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\% with only a 5.3\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline. These results highlight the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms.

TL;DR: LAP-3B is a Vision-Language-Action model that achieves substantial zero-shot transfer to unseen robot embodiments without fine-tuning, using natural language to represent robot actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs remain tightly coupled to training embodiments and require costly fine-tuning, failing to achieve true zero-shot transfer to new robot embodiments.

Method: Language-Action Pre-training (LAP) represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with pre-trained vision-language model distributions without learned tokenizers or embodiment-specific designs.

Result: LAP-3B achieves over 50% average zero-shot success across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, roughly 2x improvement over prior VLAs, and enables efficient adaptation and scaling.

Conclusion: LAP provides a simple recipe for zero-shot embodiment transfer in robotics, unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that enables co-training benefits.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.

*Chongxi Meng,Da Zhao,Yifei Zhao,Minghao Zeng,Yanmin Zhou,Zhipeng Wang,Bin He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots with hierarchical planning and GPU-accelerated adaptive control for real-time assembly and motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration of modular robots and enable adaptive motion control for unknown assembled configurations in real-time.

Method: Hierarchical planner with high-level bidirectional heuristic search (with type-penalty terms) for module-handling sequences and low-level A* search for execution trajectories, plus GPU-accelerated Annealing-Variance MPPI controller with multi-stage variance annealing strategy.

Result: Type-penalty term critical for planning robustness; greedy heuristic outperforms Hungarian heuristic in physical execution costs; annealing-variance MPPI achieves 50Hz real-time control with better velocity tracking than standard MPPI.

Conclusion: Framework successfully validates full-cycle process including module assembly, robot merging/splitting, and dynamic motion generation for heterogeneous modular robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.

### [111] [Flow-Enabled Generalization to Human Demonstrations in Few-Shot Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10594)
*Runze Tang,Penny Sweetser*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SFCrP uses scene flow prediction from cross-embodiment videos and flow-conditioned policies to improve imitation learning generalization with fewer robot demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning requires many robot demonstrations which are costly to collect. Existing flow-based methods using human videos have limitations: they focus on object/point flow rather than interaction motion, flow alone lacks precise motion details, and flow-conditioned policies overfit to training tasks.

Method: SFCrP has two components: 1) SFCr - Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning that learns from both robot and human videos to predict any point trajectories, and 2) FCrP - Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy that follows general flow motion while adjusting actions based on observations for precision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various real-world task settings, and exhibits strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of prior flow-based methods by combining scene flow prediction from cross-embodiment data with observation-conditioned policies, enabling better generalization with fewer robot demonstrations.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

TL;DR: Magnetic capsule robot with model-based pitch control using MPC and sensor fusion for gastric wall interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing magnetically actuated capsule robots neglect pitch control, which is critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls in the GI tract.

Method: Nonlinear model-based framework using 4-coil electromagnetic array, 3D finite-element simulations for magnetic characterization, constrained MPC for pitch regulation, and EKF sensor fusion combining inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements.

Result: Robust pitch reorientation achieved 3-5x faster settling with reduced oscillation vs on-off control; stable closed-loop control maintained even with camera update rate reduced from 30Hz to 1Hz.

Conclusion: Finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion provides scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-DOF capsule locomotion in clinical settings.

Abstract: Magnetically actuated capsule robots promise minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but existing systems largely neglect control of capsule pitch, a degree of freedom critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls. This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing usable cavity by 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. There's a need for more compact designs that preserve interior space for medical payloads.

Method: Developed a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets. Used compliant silicone-magnetic composite shell with programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions for strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation. Validated through magnetostatic simulations and experiments.

Result: The coating-based design enables stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion sustained with magnetic field ≥0.3 mT (effective actuation depth of 30 mm). Preserves entire interior cavity as continuous volume for medical payloads.

Conclusion: The magnetic coating approach successfully replaces internal magnets while maintaining locomotion capabilities. Future work will optimize materials, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts, and develop robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback to enhance performance and enable clinical deployment.

Abstract: Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.

Conclusion: GuadalPlanner provides an open, extensible research tool that bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for informative path planning, facilitating consistent algorithm evaluation across different abstraction levels.

Abstract: The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm aerial manipulator uses proprioceptive contact detection to blindly estimate roof inclination through physical interaction, enabling robust drone landings on slanted surfaces up to 30.5° with 2.87° average estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting roof inclination (vision-based or acoustic techniques) are unreliable due to weather conditions and surface materials, making drone landings on irregular urban rooftops challenging.

Method: Proposed a novel dual-arm aerial manipulator with omnidirectional 3D workspace, using momentum-based torque observer for proprioceptive contact detection and localization to infer surface inclination through physical interaction before touchdown.

Result: Validated in flight experiments with robust landings on surfaces up to 30.5° inclination, achieving average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87° across 9 experiments at different incline angles.

Conclusion: The proprioceptive approach enables reliable blind estimation of surface inclination through physical interaction, overcoming limitations of conventional sensing methods for urban drone operations on irregular rooftops.

Abstract: Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation lacks predictive capability, leading to errors and inefficiency. Current VLMs can't forecast future states, and existing world models have limited horizons or produce inconsistent frames.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Select and adapt robust video generation model for reliable future predictions, 2) Apply adversarial distillation for fast few-step video generation, 3) Train action model using both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors.

Result: Produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that support precise manipulation, with significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables predictive video-conditioned action for robotic manipulation, addressing limitations of existing approaches and demonstrating superior performance across key metrics.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.

TL;DR: VLA driving systems with language backbones create unique behavioral subspaces compared to vision-only backbones, leading to different driving styles (aggressive vs conservative) that can be combined via hybrid approaches for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what changes beyond the usual accuracy-cost trade-off when augmenting end-to-end driving planning with language-enabled backbones, and to explore how vision-language-action (VLA) systems differ from vision-only systems in driving behavior.

Method: Three-part analysis: 1) Compare VLM and vision-only backbones under identical diffusion Transformer planner, 2) Analyze behavioral differences in long-tail scenarios, 3) Propose HybridDriveVLA (runs both branches with learned scorer) and DualDriveVLA (fast-slow policy that defaults to ViT and invokes VLM only when needed).

Result: VLM introduces unique subspaces leading to different behaviors (aggressive vs conservative), each winning in 2-3% of scenarios. Oracle selection achieves 93.58 PDMS, HybridDriveVLA achieves 92.10 PDMS, and DualDriveVLA (VLM on 15% scenarios) achieves 91.00 PDMS with 3.2x throughput improvement.

Conclusion: VLA driving systems offer more than just accuracy-cost trade-offs - they create distinct behavioral subspaces that can be strategically combined through hybrid approaches to achieve better performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.

TL;DR: Maya Robot, an elephant-shaped social robot, reduces pain during injections and decreases anxiety in children undergoing cancer treatment, showing potential for pediatric healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emotional and physical distress experienced by children undergoing cancer treatment, particularly during painful procedures like injections, by developing a social robot companion that can provide therapeutic support and engagement.

Method: Developed Maya Robot with 98% facial expression recognition accuracy using deep neural networks. Conducted two experiments: 1) Counterbalanced study with 25 children comparing pain levels during injections with/without robot presence, 2) Study with 40 participants (20 children + mothers) assessing perspectives during robot interaction using UTAUT questionnaire.

Result: Significant reduction in perceived pain during injections when robot was present. Children experienced significantly less anxiety than parents during interactions, and children showed higher trust levels in both robot and games compared to parents (P-value < 0.05).

Conclusion: Maya Robot demonstrates positive impact as a therapeutic assistant in clinical settings for children with cancer, showing potential for improving pain management and emotional well-being in pediatric healthcare through social robot interventions.

Abstract: This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Developed deep learning models (LSTM & Transformers) to predict human gaze patterns in social interactions, achieving 60-65% accuracy, then implemented on Nao robot with positive user evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to understand gaze direction as a key indicator of human interest and intent to engage effectively in multi-party interactions and predict human intentions.

Method: Collected gaze data from 30 participants using eye-trackers and Oculus Quest 1, created video clips of social scenarios, trained deep learning models (LSTM and Transformers) to analyze gaze patterns, then implemented best model on Nao robot for evaluation by 36 new participants.

Result: Models achieved 60% accuracy in 2D animation and 65% accuracy in 3D animation for gaze direction prediction. Robot implementation received overall positive feedback, with robotics-experienced participants rating it more favorably.

Conclusion: Deep learning models can effectively predict human gaze patterns in social contexts, and implementing these models on social robots improves their ability to engage appropriately in multi-party interactions.

Abstract: During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.

*Simone Orelli,Mirko Mizzoni,Antonio Franchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First formal stability analysis for aerial platforms with force-moment coupling, proving local exponential stability of hovering equilibrium despite non-minimum-phase behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard geometric control assumes force-moment decoupling, but this breaks down in many aerial platforms where control moments naturally induce spurious forces. While experimental strategies exist for such coupled systems, there's no rigorous theoretical certification of their stability.

Method: Introduces a canonical model for floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces and constructs a Lyapunov-based proof to establish local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. The analysis explicitly addresses structural challenges like induced non-minimum-phase behavior that prevent standard cascade arguments.

Result: Provides the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies with force-moment coupling, establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium.

Conclusion: This work fills the theoretical gap by providing rigorous stability certification for aerial platforms with coupled force-moment dynamics, addressing the structural challenges that prevent standard control approaches.

Abstract: Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, an assumption that breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces naturally induced by control moments. While strategies for such coupled systems have been validated experimentally, a rigorous theoretical certification of their stability is currently missing. This work fills this gap by providing the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces. We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments.

TL;DR: RADAR benchmark exposes VLA model fragility in real-world settings by testing physical dynamics, spatial reasoning, and enabling autonomous 3D evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA model evaluation suffers from a reality gap - strong benchmark performance doesn't translate to real-world generalization due to unrealistic testing conditions, lack of spatial-physical intelligence assessment, and reliance on human evaluation.

Method: Introduces RADAR benchmark with three components: (1) principled physical dynamics suite, (2) spatial reasoning tasks, and (3) fully autonomous 3D evaluation pipeline without human supervision.

Result: VLA models show severe fragility - 3D IoU drops from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise, and models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability despite apparent competence.

Conclusion: RADAR provides necessary real-world evaluation framework revealing VLA model limitations, positioning it as essential for developing reliable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.

TL;DR: VISTA introduces a hierarchical VLA framework using world models for visual subgoal decomposition, improving generalization in OOD robot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are brittle in out-of-distribution settings with limited real-robot data, creating a generalization bottleneck for robot manipulation.

Method: Hierarchical framework with world model as high-level planner (generates subtask sequences with goal images) and VLA as low-level executor (follows textual/visual guidance).

Result: Performance improves from 14% to 69% in novel scenarios with world model guidance, outperforming baselines in OOD settings.

Conclusion: Visual goal synthesis through world models enables robust generalization across unseen objects and novel scenarios for VLA-based robot manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for MAV aerobatics suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization, especially in multi-task scenarios where a single policy must master multiple maneuvers like flips, rolls, and Power Loops.

Method: GEAR incorporates SO(2) rotational symmetry into policy architecture using: 1) equivariant actor network, 2) FiLM-based task modulation, and 3) multi-head critic, creating a unified framework for learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers.

Result: Achieves 98.85% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baselines. Real-world experiments show stable execution of multiple maneuvers and ability to combine basic motion primitives for complex aerobatics.

Conclusion: GEAR provides a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic MAV control by explicitly incorporating geometric symmetry properties into RL architecture, enabling both simulation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics.

*Haocheng Zhao,Lukas Brunke,Oliver Lagerquist,Siqi Zhou,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SQ-based safety filtering using signed distance functions instead of implicit functions prevents gradient ill-conditioning, enabling reliable collision avoidance in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control barrier functions for robot safety depend on geometric representations, but simplified shapes cause conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer expressive modeling, but using their implicit functions as barriers leads to ill-conditioned gradients that undermine real-time safety filtering.

Method: Formulate SQ-based safety filtering framework using signed distance functions as barrier candidates instead of implicit functions. Compute distances via Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients through randomized smoothing since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered, unstructured scenes with robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances. Also improves task efficiency in teleoperation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enables precise and reliable safety filters that handle geometric complexity in real-world environments by addressing gradient ill-conditioning in SQ-based collision avoidance, providing a pathway toward robust real-time safety filtering.

Abstract: Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments.

TL;DR: RISE is a scalable robotic RL framework that uses compositional world models for imagination-based policy improvement without physical interaction, achieving significant performance gains in contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, while physical RL is constrained by safety risks, hardware costs, and environment reset requirements. There's a need for scalable RL that doesn't require physical interaction.

Method: RISE uses a Compositional World Model with two components: (1) a controllable dynamics model that predicts multi-view futures, and (2) a progress value model that evaluates imagined outcomes. These enable imaginary rollouts and advantage estimation for policy improvement without physical interaction.

Result: RISE achieved significant improvements over prior methods: +35% absolute performance in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The compositional world model approach enables scalable robotic RL through imagination, overcoming physical interaction constraints while achieving substantial performance gains in challenging manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.

*Unal Artan,Martin Magnusson,Joshua A. Marshall*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel method estimates relative rock particle size from wheel loader's proprioceptive data during excavation using wavelet analysis, validated against vision-based tools and sieving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing rock fragmentation in mining/quarrying is essential but typically requires exteroceptive sensors (cameras/LiDAR). This research explores using only proprioceptive data from excavator's inertial response during digging as a simpler, potentially more robust alternative.

Method: Uses wavelet analysis on proprioceptive data (inertial response) collected during excavation with a wheel loader to construct features proportional to rock fragmentation. Ratio of wavelet features from different rock piles approximates ratio of mean particle sizes. Validated with full-scale experiments using 18-tonne battery electric LHD machine in operating quarry.

Result: Demonstrated through extensive field experiments that the wavelet feature ratio approximates the mean particle size ratio between different rock piles. Results compared favorably with both vision-based fragmentation analysis and traditional sieving methods.

Conclusion: Proprioceptive sensing using wavelet analysis provides a viable alternative to exteroceptive sensors for estimating relative rock particle size during excavation, validated in real quarry conditions against established measurement methods.

Abstract: Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.

TL;DR: Novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots enables complex maneuvers like chimney climbing and gap crossing with reactive replanning and simultaneous contact/trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenging legged robot scenarios (chimney climbing, narrow passages, large gaps) with improved planning capabilities beyond state-of-the-art, including reactive replanning and avoiding complex multi-stage approaches.

Method: Receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner that simultaneously plans contact locations and whole-body trajectories using quadratic-program-based posture generator, avoiding potential field local minima issues.

Result: With short planning horizons (1 step ahead): 45-98% faster than state-of-the-art but less efficient motions (5% fewer to 700% more stance changes). With longer horizons (4 steps ahead): planning times varied (73% faster to 400% slower) but produced higher quality motions (8% more to 47% fewer stance changes).

Conclusion: The planner offers significant speed advantages for short-horizon planning while providing higher quality motions with longer horizons, enabling complex legged robot maneuvers with simplified implementation and reactive capabilities.

Abstract: We present a novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging scenarios, able to plan motions such as chimney climbing, navigating very narrow passages or crossing large gaps. Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical goal-conditioned RL suffers from poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline/data-scarce settings, hindering practical adoption for complex long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduces NF-HIQL framework that replaces unimodal Gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both high- and low-levels, enabling tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and modeling of rich multimodal behaviors.

Result: NF-HIQL outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines across diverse long-horizon tasks (locomotion, ball-dribbling, multi-step manipulation), showing superior robustness under limited data and better generalization.

Conclusion: NF-HIQL demonstrates the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning with theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: APEX enables humanoid robots to climb platforms taller than leg length using contact-rich climbing behaviors and a novel ratchet progress reward, achieving 0.8m platform traversal (114% of leg length) with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL approaches for humanoid locomotion converge to jumping-like solutions for high platforms, which are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real deployment. There's a need for safe, contact-rich climbing-based traversal of platforms beyond leg length.

Method: APEX composes six terrain-conditioned behaviors (climb-up/down, walking/crawling, stand-up/lie-down) using a generalized ratchet progress reward that tracks best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps. Trains LiDAR-based full-body policies with sim-to-real perception gap reduction through mapping artifact modeling and elevation map filtering/inpainting, then distills all skills into a single policy.

Result: Demonstrated zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (114% of leg length) on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid, with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, and smooth multi-skill transitions.

Conclusion: APEX successfully enables humanoid robots to traverse platforms beyond leg length using contact-rich climbing behaviors, addressing the limitations of jumping-based solutions through novel reward design and sim-to-real perception strategies.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.

Method: Designed YOR with modular architecture using off-the-shelf components: omnidirectional base for mobility, telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers for whole-body manipulation.

Result: Demonstrated YOR's capability in tasks requiring coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation at under $10,000 cost.

Conclusion: YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms, making advanced robotics more accessible.

Abstract: Recent advances in robot learning have generated significant interest in capable platforms that may eventually approach human-level competence. This interest, combined with the commoditization of actuators, has propelled growth in low-cost robotic platforms. However, the optimal form factor for mobile manipulation, especially on a budget, remains an open question. We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/
