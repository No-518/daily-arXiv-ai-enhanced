Given the inherent difference in information\nentropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an\nimbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this\nparticular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment\nability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved\nthrough a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on\nexplicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the\npolysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy\nof the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A\nhypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the\ntext and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching\nerrors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst\nreducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced\ndimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the\nFlickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic\nHypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\\%\n(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while\nestablishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes OS-HGAdapter, which uses LLM semantic knowledge to bridge the entropy gap between text and images for better cross-modal alignment, achieving significant retrieval improvements.", "motivation": "Address the imbalance in cross-modal retrieval caused by different information entropy between text and images, aiming to reproduce human-like alignment capabilities.", "method": "Two-step approach: 1) LLM-enhanced text polysemy description to increase text modality entropy, 2) Hypergraph adapter for multilateral text-image connections to correct matching errors and reduce semantic noise.", "result": "Achieved 16.8% text-to-image and 40.1% image-to-text retrieval gains on Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.", "conclusion": "The proposed OS-HGAdapter effectively bridges the entropy gap between modalities using LLM semantic knowledge and hypergraph adaptation, significantly improving cross-modal retrieval performance."}}
