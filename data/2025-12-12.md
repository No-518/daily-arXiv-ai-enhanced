### [1] [Neuromorphic Eye Tracking for Low-Latency Pupil Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09969)
*Paul Hueber,Luca Peres,Florian Pitters,Alejandro Gloriani,Oliver Rhodes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neuromorphic SNN eye-tracking models achieve near state-of-the-art accuracy (3.7-4.1px error) with 20x smaller models and 850x less compute than ANNs, enabling 3.9-4.9 mW power and 3 ms latency for wearable AR/VR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional frame-based eye tracking suffers from motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution, making it unsuitable for low-power wearable AR/VR systems. Neuromorphic sensors and SNNs offer promise but existing approaches are either too specialized or underperform compared to ANNs.

Method: Created neuromorphic versions of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models by replacing recurrent and attention modules with lightweight Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) layers and using depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity.

Result: Models achieved 3.7-4.1px mean error (approaching Retina's 3.24px), with 20x smaller model size and 850x theoretical compute reduction compared to ANN variants. Projected to operate at 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

Conclusion: High-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment in AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [2] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABBSPO is a weakly supervised oriented object detection framework that improves scale estimation and orientation prediction using adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous HBox-supervised OOD methods directly compare GT HBoxes with minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, leading to inaccurate scale estimation. There's a need for better scale optimization and orientation prediction in weakly supervised settings.

Method: Proposes ABBSPO framework with two key components: (1) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) that appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for each predicted RBox size, and (2) Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing weakly supervised oriented object detection methods.

Conclusion: ABBSPO effectively addresses scale estimation and orientation prediction challenges in HBox-supervised OOD, providing a robust framework for weakly supervised oriented object detection with superior accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

### [3] [Diffusion Is Your Friend in Show, Suggest and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10038)
*Jia Cheng Hu,Roberto Cavicchioli,Alessandro Capotondi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SST combines diffusion models with autoregressive generation for image captioning, achieving SOTA results on COCO by using diffusion to suggest improvements to autoregressive captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown promise in generative tasks but still underperform autoregressive models in discrete domains like language. The authors want to leverage diffusion's bidirectional and refining capabilities while maintaining autoregressive models' strong linguistic structure.

Method: Show, Suggest and Tell (SST) uses diffusion models to provide suggestions to autoregressive generation rather than replacing it. The diffusion model offers improvements to captions generated by the autoregressive model, combining both approaches.

Result: SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on COCO without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model SOTA results by 1.5 and 2.5 points respectively. Experiments show positive correlation between suggestion quality and caption quality.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion suggestions with autoregressive generation represents a promising underexplored research direction that leverages the strengths of both approaches for improved discrete domain generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

### [4] [MetaVoxel: Joint Diffusion Modeling of Imaging and Clinical Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10041)
*Yihao Liu,Chenyu Gao,Lianrui Zuo,Michael E. Kim,Brian D. Boyd,Lisa L. Barnes,Walter A. Kukull,Lori L. Beason-Held,Susan M. Resnick,Timothy J. Hohman,Warren D. Taylor,Bennett A. Landman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion model that learns the complete distribution over medical images and clinical metadata, enabling unified zero-shot inference for multiple tasks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for medical imaging typically train separate conditional models for specific predictive tasks, which limits flexibility and requires task-specific retraining. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle multiple inference tasks with arbitrary input subsets.

Method: MetaVoxel uses a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that learns a single diffusion process spanning all variables (imaging data and clinical metadata). It models the joint distribution rather than conditional distributions, enabling flexible zero-shot inference.

Result: Using over 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans with clinical metadata from nine datasets, MetaVoxel performs image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction with performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. It demonstrates flexible inference capabilities.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability by supporting multiple tasks with a single model and flexible zero-shot inference.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

### [5] [Independent Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10067)
*Jiahao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Independent Density Estimation (IDE) method for compositional generalization in vision-language models by learning connections between individual words and image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision-language models struggle with human-like compositional generalization despite success in tasks like image captioning and conditioned image generation.

Method: Independent Density Estimation (IDE) learns connections between individual words and image features. Two implementations: 1) using fully disentangled visual representations, 2) using VAE for partially disentangled features from raw images. Also proposes entropy-based compositional inference to combine word predictions.

Result: Models show superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models across various datasets.

Conclusion: IDE effectively addresses compositional generalization challenges in vision-language models by establishing word-image feature connections and using compositional inference.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy- based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key challenges in rendering dynamic specular scenes: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling, which are essential for realistic specular effects in complex dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic geometry/material modeling, Dynamic Environment Gaussian, and hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse/specular components using rasterization and ray tracing, with coarse-to-fine training strategy.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on dynamic scene benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: TraceFlow successfully addresses reflection challenges in dynamic specular scenes through novel Gaussian-based representations and hybrid rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity specular rendering.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical instance tracking task tracks objects and parts while maintaining hierarchical relationships, with new benchmark dataset of 2,765 entities in 552 videos across 40 categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tracking methods focus on individual objects without considering hierarchical relationships between objects and their parts. There's a need for tracking that preserves these structural relationships for more comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: Proposed a novel hierarchical instance tracking task and created the first benchmark dataset with 2,765 unique entities tracked in 552 videos across 40 object and part categories. Evaluated seven variants of four models adapted for this task.

Result: The new dataset proves challenging for existing models, as evaluation of seven model variants shows difficulty in maintaining hierarchical relationships while tracking objects and parts.

Conclusion: Hierarchical instance tracking is a valuable new task requiring specialized approaches, and the introduced benchmark dataset will facilitate future research in this direction.

Abstract: We propose a novel task, hierarchical instance tracking, which entails tracking all instances of predefined categories of objects and parts, while maintaining their hierarchical relationships. We introduce the first benchmark dataset supporting this task, consisting of 2,765 unique entities that are tracked in 552 videos and belong to 40 categories (across objects and parts). Evaluation of seven variants of four models tailored to our novel task reveals the new dataset is challenging.

### [8] [Topological Conditioning for Mammography Models via a Stable Wavelet-Persistence Vectorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10151)
*Charles Fanning,Mehmet Emin Aktas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using topological data analysis with wavelet persistence channels improves breast cancer detection model generalization across different mammography scanners and populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening suffers from false positives/negatives and model degradation when deployed across different scanners, modalities, and patient populations, highlighting the need for more robust and generalizable detection methods.

Method: Propose wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology to create stable spatial multi-scale maps of image structure. Integrate these topological maps into a two-stage detection pipeline through channel concatenation at the input level.

Result: On the INbreast dataset, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increased patient-level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under limited training budget, demonstrating significant improvement in cross-population generalization.

Conclusion: Topological data analysis with wavelet persistence provides a simple yet effective conditioning signal that substantially improves external performance and generalization of breast cancer detection models across different scanners and populations.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.

*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Juan Merlos,Ashan Perera,Hari Kalva,Velibor Adzic,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCTM achieves 85.14% bitrate reduction for edge-cloud split inference by compressing intermediate features, enabling efficient deployment in bandwidth-limited applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN deployment on edge devices faces compute limitations, while cloud offloading has latency/bandwidth/privacy issues. Edge-cloud splitting needs feature compression to reduce transmission overhead.

Method: Developed Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM) as part of MPEG's Feature Coding for Machines standard, creating bitstream syntax and codec pipeline specifically for compressing intermediate DNN features.

Result: Achieved average 85.14% bitrate reduction across multiple vision tasks while maintaining model accuracy, demonstrating significant bandwidth savings.

Conclusion: FCM standard provides scalable, interoperable solution for efficient edge-cloud inference in bandwidth-limited, privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

### [10] [Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226)
*Shuhan Tan,Kashyap Chitta,Yuxiao Chen,Ran Tian,Yurong You,Yan Wang,Wenjie Luo,Yulong Cao,Philipp Krahenbuhl,Marco Pavone,Boris Ivanovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCDrive introduces a latent chain-of-thought reasoning approach for autonomous driving that uses action-aligned latent tokens instead of natural language, improving inference speed and driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision-Language-Action models may not be the most efficient representation for autonomous driving. Natural language reasoning has limitations in capturing driving action outcomes effectively.

Method: Proposes Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive) that uses action-aligned latent space for reasoning: (1) action-proposal tokens using same vocabulary as output actions, (2) world model tokens grounded in learned latent world model to express future outcomes. Cold-started with ground-truth future rollouts supervision, then post-trained with closed-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: On large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark: achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: Latent chain-of-thought reasoning in action-aligned space is more effective than natural language reasoning for autonomous driving, unifying reasoning and decision-making while improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

### [11] [Emerging Standards for Machine-to-Machine Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10230)
*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCM (Feature Coding for Machines) compresses neural features instead of pixels for machine-to-machine communication, reducing bandwidth, preserving privacy, and maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while enabling use of existing codec hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-to-machine systems inefficiently stream pixel-based video using human-optimized codecs, consuming excessive bandwidth, scaling poorly, and exposing raw images to third parties.

Method: FCM compresses intermediate neural features rather than pixels, using H.26X codecs as inner codecs, with analysis comparing H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC performance.

Result: FCM maintains accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. HEVC and VVC achieve nearly identical machine task performance (1.39% BD-Rate increase when replacing VVC with HEVC), while AVC performs worse (32.28% increase). For tracking, codec choice has minimal impact with HEVC even outperforming VVC.

Conclusion: Existing hardware for deployed codecs (especially HEVC) can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance, making FCM a practical solution for reducing bandwidth, preserving privacy, and enabling compute offload.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

### [12] [Multi-dimensional Preference Alignment by Conditioning Reward Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10237)
*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDPO addresses reward conflicts in RLHF for diffusion models by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective with conditional preference vectors and dimensional reward dropout, enabling multi-axis control at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO formulation has a fundamental limitation: it aggregates diverse evaluation axes (aesthetic quality, semantic alignment) into a single scalar reward using the Bradley-Terry model, creating reward conflicts where models unlearn desirable features from globally non-preferred samples.

Method: Proposes Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO) with: 1) Disentangled Bradley-Terry objective that injects preference outcome vectors as conditions during training, 2) Dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions, allowing independent learning of optimization directions for each reward axis within a single network.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate superior performance on benchmarks. The conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

Conclusion: MCDPO effectively resolves reward conflicts in RLHF for diffusion models by enabling disentangled multi-reward optimization, providing both improved performance and flexible inference-time control over different quality dimensions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

### [13] [Solving Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning from an Auto-Annotation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10244)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT enables effective semi-supervised few-shot learning by addressing VLM's flat probability distributions through classifier initialization and temperature tuning, outperforming existing methods by ~5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like auto-annotation require semi-supervised few-shot learning, but current SSFSL methods neglect powerful open-source Vision-Language Models that could boost performance, unlike related FSL approaches.

Method: Proposes SWIFT: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning, which uses classifier initialization and temperature tuning to address VLM's flat probability distributions, enabling effective finetuning on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and noisy pretraining data.

Result: SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by ~5 accuracy points across five SSFSL benchmarks, and even rivals supervised learning that uses ground truth labels for unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Simple techniques like classifier initialization and temperature tuning can effectively leverage open-source VLMs for SSFSL, enabling real-world auto-annotation applications with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

TL;DR: RobustSora benchmark evaluates watermark robustness in AI-generated video detection, revealing 2-8pp performance variations when watermarks are manipulated, indicating partial dependency on watermark patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC video detection benchmarks overlook that many generative models embed digital watermarks, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns, creating a need to evaluate watermark influence on detection robustness.

Method: Created RobustSora benchmark with 6,500 videos across four types (Authentic-Clean, Authentic-Spoofed, Generated-Watermarked, Generated-DeWatermarked). Introduced two tasks: Task-I tests detection on watermark-removed AI videos, Task-II assesses false alarms on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Evaluated ten models including specialized AIGC detectors, transformers, and MLLMs.

Result: Performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). Results indicate partial watermark dependency in detection models.

Conclusion: Watermark dependency exists in AIGC video detection, highlighting need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust detection research and address information integrity challenges from AI-generated video proliferation.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

*Eunho Lee,Chaehyeon Song,Seunghoon Jeong,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THE-Pose improves category-level 6D pose estimation by combining 2D topological features with 3D point cloud data via hybrid graph fusion, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D graph convolution methods focus only on local geometry and depth, making them vulnerable to intra-class variations, complex objects, and visual ambiguities. There's a need to incorporate global context and topological information for better robustness.

Method: THE-Pose extracts consistent topological features from images and fuses them with point-cloud features using a Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module. This bridges 2D image context with 3D geometric structure to handle unseen/complex objects and occlusions.

Result: On REAL275 dataset, THE-Pose achieves 35.8% improvement over 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

Conclusion: Integrating topological priors from images with 3D geometric features through hybrid graph fusion significantly improves category-level 6D pose estimation robustness and accuracy, especially for complex objects and occlusions.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

*Rui Wang,Yimu Sun,Jingxing Guo,Huisi Wu,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDKVM is a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation that uses Linear Key-Value Association for inter-frame correlations, Gated Delta Rule for memory storage, and Key-Pixel Feature Fusion for multi-scale feature integration, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac chamber segmentation in echocardiography is crucial for quantitative cardiac function analysis, but existing methods struggle with balancing long-range spatiotemporal dependency capture, computational efficiency, and fine-grained feature representation while dealing with imaging noise, artifacts, and heart deformation/motion.

Method: GDKVM architecture with three key components: 1) Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) for modeling inter-frame correlations, 2) Gated Delta Rule (GDR) for efficient storage of intermediate memory states, and 3) Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module for integrating local and global features at multiple scales to enhance robustness against boundary blurring and noise.

Result: GDKVM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two mainstream echocardiography datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: GDKVM provides an effective solution for echocardiography video segmentation that successfully addresses the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

*Yuetong Su,Baoguo Wei,Xinyu Wang,Xu Li,Lixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-NCD: A multimodal framework that fuses visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering for novel class discovery, achieving 25.3% improvement in unknown class accuracy and unique resilience to long-tail distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods rely solely on visual features, which suffer from insufficient discriminability and poor performance with long-tail data distributions. There's a need to break this bottleneck by incorporating multimodal information.

Method: Multimodal framework fusing visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering. Jointly optimizes known class image and text features to model cluster centers and semantic prototypes. Uses dual-phase discovery mechanism with semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering to dynamically separate known/novel samples.

Result: Achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes compared to current methods on CIFAR-100 dataset. Demonstrates unique resilience to long-tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

Conclusion: LLM-NCD successfully overcomes limitations of visual-only NCD methods by leveraging multimodal fusion, significantly improving novel class discovery performance and showing robustness to challenging data distributions.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

### [18] [Long-LRM++: Preserving Fine Details in Feed-Forward Wide-Coverage Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10267)
*Chen Ziwen,Hao Tan,Peng Wang,Zexiang Xu,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Long-LRM++ improves 360° scene reconstruction by combining semi-explicit scene representation with lightweight decoder, achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering while matching quality of slower implicit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: Gaussian splatting (Long-LRM) is error-sensitive causing blurring, while implicit representations (LVSM, LaCT) have high rendering fidelity but require computationally intensive decompression that prevents real-time performance. Need to retain benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time rendering.

Method: Long-LRM++ uses semi-explicit scene representation combined with lightweight decoder. Scales to 64 input views at 950×540 resolution. Overcomes limitations of both Gaussian splatting (error sensitivity) and implicit methods (slow decompression).

Result: Matches rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS on A100 GPU. Scales to 64 input views. Delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians.

Conclusion: Long-LRM++ successfully addresses the trade-off between rendering quality and speed by combining semi-explicit representation with lightweight decoder, enabling high-fidelity real-time rendering while scaling to more input views.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable Gaussian splatting (GS) have enabled feed-forward reconstruction of scenes from tens of input views. Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential "decompression" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.

### [19] [Sample-wise Adaptive Weighting for Transfer Consistency in Adversarial Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10275)
*Hongsin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAAD improves adversarial distillation by reweighting training examples based on adversarial transferability, overcoming robust saturation where stronger teachers don't always yield more robust students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods often fail to leverage state-of-the-art robust teachers effectively, as stronger teachers don't necessarily produce more robust students (robust saturation). The paper aims to understand and overcome this limitation.

Method: Proposes Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD) that measures adversarial transferability (fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples effective against teacher) and reweights training examples accordingly without extra computational cost.

Result: SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Adversarial transferability is a key factor in successful robustness transfer, and SAAD effectively addresses robust saturation by adaptively reweighting training examples based on transferability measurements.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

*Yixin Wan,Lei Ke,Wenhao Yu,Kai-Wei Chang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEdit is a new dataset for motion-centric image editing, with a benchmark showing current models struggle, and MotionNFT framework improves motion editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing datasets focus on static appearance changes or have low-quality motion edits, lacking realistic motion transformations. Motion-centric editing is scientifically challenging and practically important for applications like video synthesis and animation.

Method: Created MotionEdit dataset with high-fidelity image pairs from continuous videos. Developed MotionEdit-Bench benchmark with generative, discriminative, and preference metrics. Proposed MotionNFT framework that computes motion alignment rewards to guide models toward accurate motion transformations during fine-tuning.

Result: MotionEdit-Bench shows motion editing remains challenging for state-of-the-art diffusion models. MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit models without sacrificing general editing ability.

Conclusion: MotionEdit addresses the gap in motion-centric image editing datasets, MotionEdit-Bench reveals current limitations, and MotionNFT provides an effective solution for improving motion editing capabilities in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### [21] [ShotDirector: Directorially Controllable Multi-Shot Video Generation with Cinematographic Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10286)
*Xiaoxue Wu,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShotDirector is a framework for controllable multi-shot video generation that integrates camera control parameters with editing-pattern-aware prompting to achieve film-like shot transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods focus on low-level visual consistency but neglect intentional film-editing patterns and cinematographic language, resulting in mere sequential shot changes without coherent narrative expression.

Method: Proposes ShotDirector with: 1) camera control module using 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings for precise camera information injection, 2) shot-aware mask mechanism with hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, and 3) ShotWeaver40K dataset capturing film-like editing priors.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in achieving film-like controllable shot transitions, with developed evaluation metrics for multi-shot video generation.

Conclusion: ShotDirector effectively combines parameter-level camera control with high-level semantic guidance to enable intentional film-editing patterns in multi-shot video generation, addressing the limitation of current methods that lack cinematographic language.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Karthikeya KV,Narendra Bandaru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangled360 is a 3D-aware framework for 360° view synthesis that disentangles isotropic/anisotropic lighting in Gaussian Splatting, enabling medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction without scene-specific finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across different contexts (medical imaging vs. natural scenes), creating limitations for realistic 360° view synthesis applications.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting backbone with direction disentangled volume rendering, dual-branch conditioning (CT intensity for medical, normalized camera embeddings for RGB), and hybrid pose-agnostic anchoring for scale/structure stability.

Result: Superior SSIM and LPIPS performance on Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets; runtime assessments confirm viability for interactive applications.

Conclusion: Enables mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation by integrating preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a single inference pipeline without scene-specific finetuning.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

*Duo Zheng,Shijia Huang,Yanyang Li,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN reduces training overhead in Vision-Language Navigation by using progressive/recursive memory mechanisms and dynamic mixed policy, achieving SOTA performance with 282 GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show promise in VLN but face high training overhead from quadratic computation of long historical observations and exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger data aggregation.

Method: Two efficient memory mechanisms: progressive memory (dynamic token allocation to recent observations) and learnable recursive memory (key-value cache as memory state). Plus dynamic mixed policy to balance exploration-efficiency trade-off.

Result: Achieves SOTA on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR) with only 282 H800 GPU hours, dramatically reducing training overhead compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN effectively addresses training efficiency challenges in VLN while maintaining high performance, making MLLM-based VLN more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Proposes a dual-modal prototype bank combining CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning for text-based prototypes with learnable image prototypes, plus a multi-scale pyramid module to address oversmoothing in ViT representations and improve spatial precision.

Result: Experiments on BCSS-WSSS benchmark show the approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, with analyses demonstrating benefits of text description diversity, context length, and complementary behavior of text and image prototypes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages textual semantics and visual prototype learning jointly for WSSS in digital pathology, highlighting the value of vision-language alignment for improved region discovery under weak supervision.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology that combines CONCH's morphology-aware representations, SegFormer's spatial cues, and text-guided semantic alignment to generate high-quality pseudo masks without dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology rely on classification backbones that only localize discriminative regions, failing to capture full tissue structure extent. Vision-language models like CONCH offer semantic alignment but combining them with segmentation backbones like SegFormer remains challenging under weak supervision.

Method: Proposes a prototype learning framework integrating: 1) morphology-aware representations from CONCH, 2) multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, 3) text-guided semantic alignment. Uses text-guided prototype initialization with pathology descriptions and structural distillation to transfer spatial knowledge from SegFormer while preserving fine-grained patterns.

Result: Outperforms existing WSSS methods on BCSS-WSSS datasets, produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, enhances semantic consistency across tissue types, and remains computationally efficient through frozen foundation models and lightweight adapters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates complementary strengths of vision-language models and segmentation backbones for WSSS in histopathology, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency through frozen backbones and minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

Additionally, we present a large-scale indoor dataset MVPose3D, which contains multiple modalities, including IMU data of non-trivial human motions, dense multi-view point clouds, and RGB images.

### [27] [EchoingPixels: Cross-Modal Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Audio-Visual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10324)
*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels is an audio-visual token reduction framework that uses cross-modal interaction to dynamically compress joint audio-visual streams, achieving 2-3x speedup with only 5-20% of original tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV-LLMs suffer from massive computational overhead from audio and video tokens. Existing unimodal token reduction methods can't leverage audio-visual synergies, and static per-modality budgets are suboptimal due to dynamic information densities. There's no existing solution for joint audio-visual token reduction.

Method: EchoingPixels uses Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) to co-attend to joint multimodal streams and reduce tokens from a combined pool rather than fixed per-modality budgets. It also includes Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to preserve temporal relationships for sparsely selected tokens.

Result: The framework achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of original tokens, with 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Conclusion: EchoingPixels effectively addresses the audio-visual token reduction bottleneck by leveraging cross-modal synergies and dynamic budget allocation, enabling efficient AV-LLMs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Method: Proposes StainNet, a vision transformer-based foundation model using self-distillation SSL, trained on 1.4M patch images from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on slide-level liver malignancy classification and two public ROI-level datasets, shows effectiveness in few-ratio learning and retrieval tasks, and outperforms larger PFMs on special stain applications.

Conclusion: StainNet addresses the gap in specialized foundation models for special stains, providing improved performance for clinical applications involving immunohistochemistry and other special staining techniques.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

### [29] [Simple Yet Effective Selective Imputation for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10327)
*Cai Xu,Jinlong Liu,Yilin Zhang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISMVC selectively imputes missing multi-view data based on informativeness, integrates with VAE for clustering, outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for incomplete multi-view clustering have limitations: imputation-based methods introduce noise when information is insufficient, while imputation-free methods struggle with severe incompleteness due to lack of cross-view complementarity.

Method: ISMVC evaluates imputation-relevant informativeness of missing positions using intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, selectively imputes only when sufficient support exists. Integrates with variational autoencoder with mixture-of-Gaussians prior for clustering-friendly latent representations, performs distribution-level imputation to stabilize aggregation and model uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under realistic unbalanced missing scenarios demonstrate ISMVC outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

Conclusion: ISMVC provides a lightweight, data-driven, model-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing incomplete multi-view clustering models, offering robust performance by balancing the benefits of imputation while avoiding its pitfalls.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes a conditional generative framework (Pix2Pix-based) with filament-aware structural loss to generate realistic synthetic filament microscopy images from binary masks, addressing data shortage for filament segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filament segmentation is crucial for biological analysis but suffers from data shortage due to the extreme difficulty of manual pixel-level annotation for dense, geometrically complex filaments like microtubules and actin filaments.

Method: Conditional generative framework based on Pix2Pix architecture that generates realistic filament microscopy images from binary masks, enhanced with a novel filament-aware structural loss to improve structural similarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness, showing it outperforms existing models trained without synthetic data for filament segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generative framework successfully addresses the filament segmentation data shortage problem by generating high-quality synthetic training data, improving segmentation performance over methods lacking synthetic data.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

*Jay Karhade,Nikhil Keetha,Yuchen Zhang,Tanisha Gupta,Akash Sharma,Sebastian Scherer,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Any4D is a scalable multi-view transformer for dense 4D reconstruction that directly predicts per-pixel motion and geometry across multiple frames, supporting multiple input modalities and achieving 2-3x lower error with 15x faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on 4D reconstruction has been limited to either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking, and most methods only handle monocular RGB videos without supporting additional sensors or modalities.

Method: Uses a scalable multi-view transformer with modular 4D scene representation: egocentric factors (depthmaps, camera intrinsics) in local camera coordinates and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics, scene flow) in global world coordinates. Supports multiple input modalities including RGB-D frames, IMU egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements.

Result: Achieves superior performance with 2-3x lower error and 15x faster computation compared to prior methods across diverse setups.

Conclusion: Any4D provides a flexible, efficient framework for dense 4D reconstruction that supports multiple sensors and opens avenues for various downstream applications.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

TL;DR: HD-CLIP is a plug-and-play module that decomposes low-quality images into semantic and ordinal degradation embeddings to guide diffusion models for real-world super-resolution, improving detail fidelity without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution faces challenges with diverse, unknown degradations. Existing methods assume known degradation severity and use CLIP text encoders that can't capture numerical severity, limiting generalization to complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes HD-CLIP (Hierarchical Degradation CLIP) that decomposes low-quality images into semantic embedding and ordinal degradation embedding capturing ordered relationships. Integrates into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance and proposes classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG).

Result: HD-CLIP improves detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets. As a plug-and-play module, it can be integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by providing richer degradation guidance to diffusion models, enabling better handling of complex real-world degradations while suppressing hallucinations and artifacts.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual sequential planning and error correction; CoSPlan benchmark reveals limitations; SGI method improves performance by 5.2% through intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have impressive reasoning capabilities but remain unexplored in visual sequential planning, especially in handling non-optimal/erroneous steps that require detection and correction.

Method: Proposed CoSPlan benchmark to evaluate VLMs on error-prone sequential planning across 4 domains. Introduced Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), a training-free method that adds intermediate reasoning steps between initial and goal states to help VLMs reason about sequences.

Result: VLMs (Intern-VLM, Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan despite using advanced reasoning techniques. SGI method yields average 5.2% performance gain, enhances reliability in corrective sequential planning, and generalizes to traditional planning tasks like Plan-Bench and VQA.

Conclusion: VLMs have limitations in visual sequential planning with errors; SGI provides effective training-free improvement through intermediate reasoning; benchmark reveals need for better contextual reasoning in VLMs for practical planning tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods rely on fixed skeletal templates, limiting generalization to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. There's a lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies with textual conditions.

Method: Introduces OmniZoo dataset (140 species, 32,979 sequences with multimodal annotations) and a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework. Key component is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space for fusion with textual semantics.

Result: The method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions given text prompts and target skeletons, and enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Conclusion: OmniZoo addresses the core limitations of current motion generation by providing both large-scale heterogeneous data and a unified framework that generalizes across arbitrary skeletal topologies while supporting text-driven motion generation and cross-species transfer.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches for medical imaging often use 2D encoders that fail to capture the volumetric nature of 3D medical data, limiting their effectiveness for volumetric segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes TranSamba, a hybrid architecture that augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks. These blocks leverage state space models' linear complexity to enable efficient information exchange across neighboring slices, enhancing the Transformer's self-attention within slices for better object localization.

Result: TranSamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse medical imaging modalities and pathologies. It provides effective volumetric modeling with linear time complexity scaling with input volume depth and constant memory usage for batch processing.

Conclusion: TranSamba successfully addresses the limitations of 2D approaches for volumetric medical segmentation by combining Transformers and Mamba models, offering an efficient and effective solution for weakly supervised 3D medical image analysis with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

TL;DR: mmCounter uses mmWave radar to count static people in dense indoor spaces by detecting ultra-low frequency breathing and micro-movements, achieving accurate counting without prior knowledge of person count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave radars struggle to detect static people in dense groups due to spatial resolution limitations and reliance on movement. Existing breathing rate estimation methods assume known person count, creating a need for accurate static person counting in crowded indoor spaces.

Method: Extracts ultra-low frequency (<1 Hz) signals from breathing and micro-scale body movements, applies novel multi-stage signal processing to differentiate signals from noise and static objects, extracts relevant low-frequency sources with spatial information, and maps sources to individual people.

Result: 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments; 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in untested environments; can count up to 7 people in 3 square meters with minimal spacing.

Conclusion: mmCounter successfully addresses the challenge of counting static people in dense indoor environments using mmWave radar, overcoming limitations of existing approaches by leveraging subtle physiological signals and advanced signal processing.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex VideoQA tasks.

Method: Equip MLLMs with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, and propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools to progressively localize key areas in videos.

Result: STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework represent an important step toward building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Funnel addresses MLLMs' fine-grained perception limitations by solving "Contextual Blindness" through hierarchical multi-crop portfolios instead of unstructured cropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual details despite impressive reasoning capabilities. Existing cropping methods cause "Contextual Blindness" - a structural disconnect between high-fidelity details and global context, limiting precision-demanding applications.

Method: Visual Funnel: training-free two-step approach with 1) Contextual Anchoring to identify region of interest in single forward pass, and 2) Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves hierarchical context using attention entropy to dynamically determine crop sizes and refine centers.

Result: Significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Shows that adding unstructured crops provides limited or detrimental benefits, confirming hierarchical structure is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Conclusion: The problem is not information quantity but structural diversity. Visual Funnel's hierarchical portfolio approach effectively resolves Contextual Blindness in MLLMs by maintaining proper context structure.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

TL;DR: P2S is a training-free zero-shot framework for long video moment retrieval that addresses search phase candidate explosion and costly VLM verification through adaptive span generation and query decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for zero-shot long video moment retrieval face dual challenges: search phase candidate explosion and costly VLM verification in the refine phase, limiting practical deployment.

Method: P2S introduces two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Span Generator to prevent candidate explosion in search phase, and (2) Query Decomposition to refine candidates without relying on expensive VLM verification.

Result: P2S outperforms supervised state-of-the-art methods, achieving +3.7% improvement on R5@0.1 on MAD dataset, making it the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos.

Conclusion: The proposed P2S framework successfully addresses the computational challenges of long video moment retrieval without task-specific training, demonstrating superior performance over supervised methods while being training-free.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

TL;DR: CoherentGS addresses 3D reconstruction from sparse, blurry images using dual generative priors (deblurring + diffusion) to break the vicious cycle between sparse views and motion blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) requires dense, high-quality images but fails with real-world sparse, blurry data where sparse views ignore multi-view constraints needed to resolve blur, and blur erases details needed for view alignment.

Method: Dual-prior strategy combining pre-trained deblurring network for sharp details/photometric guidance and diffusion model for geometric priors, plus consistency-guided camera exploration and depth regularization loss.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world scenes with as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views, setting new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoherentGS successfully breaks the vicious cycle between sparse views and motion blur, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from challenging real-world imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

*Jingyun Fu,Zhiyu Xiang,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR fusion, addressing radar noise and sparsity challenges with novel fusion module and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar complements LiDAR for scene flow estimation as it's cheaper, weather-robust, and provides point-wise velocity, but radar-LiDAR fusion remains unexplored with challenges in radar noise, low resolution, and lack of suitable datasets.

Method: Created first Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset with preprocessing for radar denoising and flow label generation. Proposed RaLiFlow framework with Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module that integrates radar dynamic cues into cross-attention, plus specialized loss functions to handle unreliable radar data and enhance instance-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods on the repurposed scene flow dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed RaLiFlow framework successfully demonstrates effective radar-LiDAR fusion for scene flow estimation, overcoming radar data challenges and establishing a new benchmark for multimodal scene flow learning.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

*Alberto Rota,Elena De Momi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised deep learning pipeline for feature matching in surgical endoscopy using novel-view synthesis and contrastive learning to adapt DINOv2 for surgical domain challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical endoscopy requires precise pixel-level correspondences for 3D reconstruction and camera tracking, but conventional computer vision fails due to weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian reflections, and deformable anatomy. Existing deep learning models trained on natural scenes don't generalize well to surgical images.

Method: Self-supervised pipeline using novel-view synthesis to generate ground-truth correspondences, then mining triplets for contrastive learning. Augments DINOv2 backbone with additional Transformer layer optimized to produce embeddings for direct matching via cosine similarity thresholding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SCARED datasets with improved matching precision and lower epipolar error.

Conclusion: The framework enables more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy by adapting deep learning to domain-specific challenges through self-supervised optimization.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM benchmarks focus on reasoning but neglect fine-grained recognition needed for practical applications.

Method: Create FROW benchmark with mosaic data (combined short answers) and open-world data (real-world Q&A from GPT-4o), plus optimization strategies for data construction and training.

Result: Mosaic data improves category recognition by 1%; open-world data boosts FROW accuracy by 10-20% and content accuracy by 6-12%; fine-grained pre-training improves category recognition up to 10%.

Conclusion: FROW benchmark addresses fine-grained recognition gap in LVLMs, with proposed data strategies significantly improving performance.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive dual-weight gravitational point cloud denoising method achieving high accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance through octree partitioning, adaptive voxel filtering, and gravitational scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point clouds often contain noise that degrades object detection accuracy. Existing methods trade off between computational efficiency and denoising quality, failing to achieve high accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance simultaneously.

Method: 1) Octree spatial partitioning for parallel acceleration; 2) Adaptive voxel occupancy statistics and kNN density estimation to remove isolated/low-density noise; 3) Gravitational scoring function combining density weights with adaptive distance weights to distinguish noise from object points.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Stanford 3D, CADC, and FMCW LiDAR datasets, showing consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance across various noise conditions while reducing single-frame processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance simultaneously, validated by improved metrics and reduced processing time across multiple datasets and noise scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiHateLoc is a weakly-supervised framework for temporal localization of multimodal hate speech in videos, using only video-level labels to produce frame-level predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube has intensified multimodal hate speech spread, where harmful cues appear subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research focuses only on video-level classification, leaving temporal localization largely unaddressed, especially under weak supervision where only video-level labels are available.

Method: MultiHateLoc incorporates: (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns with tailored text preprocessing; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasize the most informative modality at each moment, plus cross-modal contrastive alignment for feature consistency; (3) modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets show that MultiHateLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localization task, producing fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions despite relying solely on coarse video-level labels.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc successfully addresses the challenging problem of weakly-supervised multimodal hate localization, providing an effective framework that captures cross-modal and temporal dynamics while requiring only video-level supervision, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

TL;DR: MaGRoad introduces a path-centric framework for robust off-road road network extraction, addressing limitations of node-centric methods, and releases the WildRoad dataset for off-road environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vectorized road extraction methods work well in urban settings but fail in off-road environments due to domain gaps, lack of large-scale off-road datasets, and structural weaknesses in node-centric approaches that are fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions.

Method: Introduces MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly, and releases WildRoad dataset created with a dedicated interactive annotation tool.

Result: MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets, with roughly 2.5x faster inference speed for improved practical applicability.

Conclusion: The combination of the WildRoad dataset and the path-centric MaGRoad framework provides a stronger foundation for mapping roads in wild, off-road environments, addressing previous limitations in off-road road network extraction.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

Conclusion: TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings through effective cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

TL;DR: NCTTA improves test-time adaptation by addressing sample-wise misalignment between features and classifier weights using hybrid targets that blend geometric proximity with predictive confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods lack theoretical understanding of why performance degrades under domain shifts. The paper aims to provide theoretical insights by extending Neural Collapse to sample-wise analysis and identifying misalignment as the root cause of degradation.

Method: Extends Neural Collapse to sample-wise level (NC3+), identifies misalignment problem, then proposes NCTTA - a feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets that combines geometric proximity with predictive confidence to mitigate unreliable pseudo-labels.

Result: NCTTA significantly outperforms existing methods like Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C, demonstrating enhanced robustness to domain shifts through better feature-classifier alignment.

Conclusion: Sample-wise misalignment between features and classifier weights is the fundamental cause of TTA performance degradation, and NCTTA effectively addresses this by realigning features with hybrid targets, providing both theoretical insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies.

*Han Li,Shaohui Li,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Xinlong Pan,Haipeng Wang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

TL;DR: Proposed unified-transform video compression framework with dual-domain temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-experts to eliminate error propagation while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned video compression frameworks face a dilemma: separate-transform frameworks cause error propagation, while unified-transform frameworks have inferior motion estimation/compensation in shared latent domains. Need to eliminate error propagation while maintaining good temporal alignment.

Method: 1) Dual-domain progressive temporal alignment: coarse pixel-domain alignment for simple motion + refined latent-domain alignment using Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer for complex motion. 2) Quality-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts (QCMoE): dynamically assigns experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while successfully eliminating error propagation, enabling quality-consistent and error-propagation-free video streaming.

Conclusion: The proposed unified-transform framework with dual-domain temporal alignment and QCMoE effectively addresses the error propagation vs. temporal alignment dilemma in learned video compression, offering both competitive performance and error-free streaming.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid SFF framework combines traditional DDL kernels for focus volume extraction with lightweight GRU-based depth refinement and learned upsampling, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning SFF methods use heavy feature encoders and simple aggregation that introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in depth maps.

Method: Multi-scale focus volumes computed traditionally using Directional Dilated Laplacian kernels, fed into lightweight multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction with iterative refinement and learned convex upsampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods on synthetic and real-world datasets with superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach combining traditional focus volume computation with lightweight deep learning refinement achieves better depth estimation with fewer artifacts and better detail preservation.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

TL;DR: Blink is a dynamic visual token resolution framework for MLLMs that mimics human visual scanning by selectively allocating more computation to salient regions through token super-resolution and adaptive token dropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual perception compared to humans who efficiently perceive complex scenes by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. The authors want to investigate whether MLLMs can exhibit similar behavior and enhance their visual perception.

Method: Blink framework with two modules: 1) saliency-guided scanning that estimates token importance using attention maps, and 2) dynamic token resolution that extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module, then drops extended tokens when they lose focus in subsequent layers.

Result: Extensive experiments validate Blink's effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding. The framework improves MLLMs' ability to balance broad exploration and fine-grained focus adaptively and efficiently.

Conclusion: Blink successfully emulates human-inspired visual scanning within a single forward pass, demonstrating that dynamic allocation of computation to salient visual tokens can significantly enhance MLLMs' visual perception capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: GETok successfully embeds spatial relationships directly into tokens, advancing MLLMs' native 2D space reasoning capabilities without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

*Meher Md Saad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot prototypical network with ST-GCN and multi-scale temporal aggregation achieves 43.75% Top-1 accuracy on WLASL, outperforming standard classification by 13% and showing strong zero-shot generalization to SignASL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISLR faces data scarcity and long-tail distribution problems, making standard classification approaches struggle with overfitting to frequent classes and poor generalization to rare signs.

Method: Few-shot prototypical network framework with skeleton-based encoder using ST-GCN and novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module, employing episodic training to learn semantic metric space for classification based on proximity to dynamic class prototypes.

Result: Achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on WLASL test set, outperforming standard classification baseline with identical backbone by over 13%, and shows strong zero-shot generalization with nearly 30% accuracy on unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Prototypical training strategy effectively addresses data scarcity in ISLR, offering scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data through metric learning paradigm.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods rely on complex architectures (Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompts, but well-crafted feature extraction already encodes degradation information that can be effectively leveraged with simpler designs.

Method: Proposes SymUNet: symmetric U-Net architecture with aligned feature scales across encoder-decoder and streamlined cross-scale propagation. Also introduces SE-SymUNet variant that integrates frozen CLIP features via cross-attention for semantic enhancement.

Result: Achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. Both SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for all-in-one image restoration.

Conclusion: Symmetric U-Net design effectively preserves intrinsic degradation signals, making simple additive fusion sufficient for state-of-the-art performance, offering a simpler yet stronger alternative to complex architectures in all-in-one image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

TL;DR: Proposes a weather-robust salient object detection framework with a noise indicator fusion module to handle weather-induced degradation in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods assume low-noise conditions and overlook weather-induced noise degradation in real-world scenarios, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Weather-specific SOD framework with noise indicator fusion module (NIFM) that uses one-hot weather vectors to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation between encoder stages.

Result: Extensive experiments on WXSOD dataset show improved segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to vanilla encoders, with compatibility maintained across various decoder configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed NIFM-enhanced encoder effectively handles weather noise while maintaining compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders, advancing practical SOD applications in real-world weather conditions.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free text-only retrieval method for remote sensing images using VLM-generated structured captions, achieving competitive performance with supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap in remote sensing image retrieval and overcome limitations of costly domain-specific training for VLMs, while lacking benchmarks for zero-shot VLM utility evaluation.

Method: Introduce RSRT dataset with structured captions, propose TRSLLaVA - a training-free text-only retrieval method that reformulates cross-modal retrieval as text-to-text matching using VLM-generated captions in unified textual embedding space.

Result: Achieves 42.62% mean Recall on RSITMD (nearly double CLIP's 23.86%), competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models on RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality semantic representation through structured text provides powerful, cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval without training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding in challenging conditions (occlusion, camouflage, rapid movement) depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance, but existing methods often require user queries and don't autonomously discover motion patterns.

Method: TCAM uses motion-field attention to identify multiple motion activities and ground descriptions to trajectories, aligning motion patterns with contrastive vision-language representations through unified training combining global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence.

Result: On MeViS benchmark: 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: Motion patterns aligned with vision-language representations provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions, enabling query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions with strong performance across video understanding tasks.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

TL;DR: DOCR-Inspector is a VLM-based framework for fine-grained error detection and quality assessment in document parsing, outperforming commercial models and enabling parsing refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document parsing evaluation relies on benchmark scores that have dataset biases and obscure error patterns, making it hard to assess real-world parsing quality comprehensively.

Method: Formalizes assessment as fine-grained error detection using VLM-as-a-Judge, identifies 28 error types, trains on DOCRcase-200K dataset, and uses Chain-of-Checklist reasoning for hierarchical quality analysis.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro and leading open-source models on DOCRcaseBench (882 real-world cases), and its assessments effectively guide parsing refinement.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector provides reliable, comprehensive document parsing assessment that serves as both a practical evaluator and a driver for improving parsing systems at scale.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

Conclusion: K-Track provides a practical path for deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Motivation: Current 3D models capture surface geometry but neglect internal physical properties like volumetric density, which are critical for predicting object behavior in robotics and simulation. The main bottleneck has been lack of large-scale real-world data.

Method: Introduce XDen-1K dataset with 1,000 objects across 148 categories, featuring high-resolution 3D models with part-level annotations and real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Develop novel optimization framework to recover volumetric density fields from sparse X-ray views.

Result: Dataset enables accurate volumetric density estimation. When used to condition segmentation networks, improves volumetric segmentation. Experiments show improved center-of-mass estimation accuracy and higher robotic manipulation success rates.

Conclusion: XDen-1K serves as foundational resource and benchmark for physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI, bridging the gap in physical property estimation data and enabling better prediction of object behavior in real-world applications.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

Motivation: Current zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods rely on large-scale models and cloud inference, causing high latency, energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance - all problematic for real-world robotics with limited compute and need for on-device inference.

Method: Combines foundation model visual features with geometric filtering: computes similarity maps between template DINO descriptors and scene patches, establishes mutual correspondences by projecting scene patches to 3D and template descriptors to object model coordinates, then recovers poses via correspondence-driven RANSAC ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric considering reprojection consistency and spatial support.

Result: Achieves sub-second inference on single commodity GPU (1.08 FPS) while matching average recall of larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR), requires no training/fine-tuning/network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose advances practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment by trading model scale for geometric reliability, enabling lightweight, training-free pose estimation suitable for real-world robotics constraints.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

*Romain Seailles,Jean-Baptiste Masson,Jean Ponce,Julien Mairal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reformulates SMLM as set-matching problem with optimal-transport loss, eliminating non-differentiable NMS layers and enabling end-to-end training for faster live-cell imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMLM requires non-overlapping fluorophores leading to long acquisition times, hindering live-cell imaging. Deep learning approaches use non-differentiable NMS layers that may discard true positives.

Method: Reformulates SMLM training as set-matching problem with optimal-transport loss, eliminating NMS during inference. Proposes iterative neural network integrating microscope optical system knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data at moderate and high emitter densities.

Conclusion: The set-matching formulation with optimal-transport loss enables end-to-end training without NMS, improving SMLM performance for faster live-cell imaging applications.

Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows reconstructing biology-relevant structures beyond the diffraction limit by detecting and localizing individual fluorophores -- fluorescent molecules stained onto the observed specimen -- over time to reconstruct super-resolved images. Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data show that both our new loss function and architecture surpass the state of the art at moderate and high emitter densities.

### [71] [What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10794)
*Jaskirat Singh,Xingjian Leng,Zongze Wu,Liang Zheng,Richard Zhang,Eli Shechtman,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iREPA improves generative training by focusing on spatial structure rather than global semantics in representation alignment, using simple convolutional and spatial normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates what aspect of target representations matters for generation in representation alignment methods - whether it's global semantic information or spatial structure between patch tokens. Current wisdom assumes stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation, but this assumption is questioned.

Method: The authors first conduct large-scale empirical analysis across 27 vision encoders to understand what drives generation performance. They then introduce iREPA with two simple modifications: replacing MLP projection with convolution layer and adding spatial normalization layer for external representations, specifically accentuating spatial information transfer.

Result: Surprisingly, spatial structure rather than global performance drives generation performance. iREPA consistently improves convergence speed across diverse vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT, etc.) with minimal code changes (<4 lines).

Conclusion: The work challenges prevailing assumptions about representation alignment, showing that spatial structure is more important than global semantics for generation. The simple iREPA modifications motivate revisiting fundamental mechanisms of representational alignment for improved generative model training.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

TL;DR: SHARP enables photorealistic 3D view synthesis from a single image using 3D Gaussian representations, achieving real-time rendering and state-of-the-art quality with 1000x faster synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating photorealistic novel views from a single input image, which has applications in VR/AR, content creation, and 3D scene understanding. Current methods often suffer from slow synthesis times or limited photorealism.

Method: SHARP uses a neural network to regress parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation from a single input image in a single feedforward pass (<1 second). The 3D Gaussians form a metric representation with absolute scale that supports real-time rendering of novel views.

Result: SHARP achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% compared to prior methods. It also reduces synthesis time by three orders of magnitude (1000x faster) while maintaining photorealistic quality.

Conclusion: SHARP demonstrates that efficient single-image 3D scene reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis is achievable through 3D Gaussian representations, enabling real-time applications with robust zero-shot generalization across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: MMSI-Video-Bench is a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark for evaluating video-based spatial intelligence in multimodal large language models, covering perception, planning, prediction, and cross-video reasoning across 1,106 questions from diverse video sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to assess MLLMs' spatial understanding over continuous visual input, which is crucial for them to become effective general-purpose assistants in physical environments.

Method: Created a fully human-annotated benchmark with 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 video clips from 25 existing datasets and in-house videos, organized around a four-level framework (Perception, Planning, Prediction, Cross-Video Reasoning) with expert-reviewed questions and explanatory rationales.

Result: Evaluation of 25 MLLMs reveals a significant human-AI gap: many models perform near chance, best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. Spatially fine-tuned models fail to generalize, and systematic failures are found in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence, revealing current limitations in MLLMs and providing insights for future development through comprehensive evaluation and error analysis.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes uncertainty estimation methods for landmark-based chest X-ray segmentation, introducing two complementary uncertainty measures and releasing a large-scale dataset with per-node uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, but prior work has focused on pixel-level uncertainty while landmark-based segmentation with topological guarantees remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective.

Method: Uses hybrid neural network architectures combining standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, leveraging their variational latent space to derive two uncertainty measures: (1) latent uncertainty from learned distribution parameters, and (2) predictive uncertainty from multiple stochastic output predictions via latent sampling.

Result: Both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity in controlled corruption experiments, reflecting global and local degradation. The uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions and support out-of-distribution detection. The authors release CheXmask-U, a large-scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation is a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray, with released dataset and tools enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early children's developmental trajectories provide a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models, aiming to create more developmentally plausible AI systems.

Method: Uses a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set from infant-centric audiovisual corpus (video-utterance, image-utterance, multi-turn conversations), plus DevCV Toolbox adapting NIH Baby Toolbox measures into 10 multimodal tasks for evaluation.

Result: Compact models pretrained from scratch achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks in spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding.

Conclusion: The principled BabyVLM-V2 framework aims to accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models by providing unified tools and benchmarks.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained 3D spatial understanding, which is crucial for autonomous driving systems interacting with the physical world.

Method: Proposes SpaceDrive with a universal positional encoder for 3D coordinates from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. Uses 3D positional encodings to augment 2D visual tokens and as task-agnostic coordinate representations, replacing digit-wise numerical tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on nuScenes dataset and second-best Driving Score (78.02) on Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark among VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: SpaceDrive effectively addresses VLM limitations in 3D spatial reasoning by treating spatial information as explicit positional encodings, enabling better semantic-spatial joint reasoning and more accurate trajectory planning.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Motivation: Existing video depth estimation methods either suffer from temporal inconsistencies (frame-by-frame monocular models) or are computationally demanding for real-time use, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Proposes VeloDepth with a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features/predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections, structurally enforcing temporal consistency.

Result: State-of-the-art temporal consistency, competitive accuracy on multiple benchmarks, and significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators.

Conclusion: VeloDepth provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

TL;DR: OmniView is a unified diffusion model framework that generalizes across diverse 4D consistency tasks (novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video) by separately representing space, time, and view conditions, achieving competitive performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches to camera control in diffusion models are fragmented, focusing on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks and trained on disjoint data slices. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle diverse 4D tasks without task-specific specialization.

Method: OmniView separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. This unified architecture allows the model to handle various 4D tasks including novel view synthesis from static/dynamic/multiview inputs, temporal extrapolation, and text/image-to-video with camera control.

Result: Competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks: improves image quality scores by up to 33% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reduces camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model that can handle multiple camera control and 4D consistency tasks within a single unified framework, outperforming fragmented task-specific approaches.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

Method: Propose IRMoGen paradigm with IRG-MotionLLM model that interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. Use three-stage training scheme and automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing datasets.

Result: Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; interleaving generation, assessment, and refinement yields consistent performance gains; IRG-MotionLLM outperforms baseline models and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Interleaved reasoning through assessment and refinement bridges motion understanding and generation, enabling bidirectional knowledge flow that improves motion generation performance in text-to-motion tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks.

TL;DR: Mull-Tokens introduces modality-agnostic latent tokens that allow models to think abstractly in both text and image modalities for improved spatial reasoning, achieving +3% average improvement on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reasoning requires going beyond language to handle spatial, temporal, and affordance reasoning that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models are brittle, rely on specialist tools, costly image generation, or handcrafted data, and don't scale well for switching between text and image thoughts.

Method: Mull-Tokens are modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities, allowing free-form thinking toward correct answers. The approach involves: 1) training Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and 2) fine-tuning without supervision using only final answers, inspired by latent reasoning frameworks.

Result: Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks (including puzzle solving and perspective-taking tasks), Mull-Tokens outperformed several baselines using text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% improvement on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities, addressing challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning by enabling models to hold intermediate information in either modality and think free-form toward correct answers.

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

Conclusion: LDP offers a scalable, clinically viable solution for primary healthcare polyp diagnosis, demonstrating robustness and significant computational efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Colonoscopic polyp diagnosis is pivotal for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional automated reporting suffers from inconsistencies and hallucinations due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose LDP, a novel framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for professional polyp diagnosis report generation. Specifically, we curate MMEndo, a multimodal endoscopic dataset comprising expert-annotated colonoscopy image-text pairs. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B backbone using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) and align it with clinical standards via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning. The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness.

TL;DR: AlcheMinT enables precise temporal control over subject appearance/disappearance in subject-driven video generation through timestamp conditioning and positional encoding, without adding cross-attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subject-driven video generation methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which is essential for applications like compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation.

Method: Introduces explicit timestamps conditioning with novel positional encoding for temporal intervals, incorporates subject-descriptive text tokens for better identity binding, and uses token-wise concatenation to avoid additional cross-attention modules with negligible parameter overhead.

Result: Achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods while enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos for the first time.

Conclusion: AlcheMinT provides a unified framework for temporally controlled subject-driven video generation with minimal architectural changes, addressing a critical gap in current video personalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD simulations for coronary blood flow are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their integration into clinical workflows and availability of labeled data for AI training, which hinders broad adoption of non-invasive CAD assessment.

Method: Developed an end-to-end pipeline automating coronary geometry extraction from CCTA, streamlining simulation data generation, and enabling efficient learning of pressure distributions. Introduced a diffusion-based regression model to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA features, bypassing CFD computation during inference.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance with R² of 64.42%, RMSE of 0.0974, and normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches on simulated coronary hemodynamics data.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis, reducing manual burden and computational costs compared to traditional CFD workflows.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

TL;DR: First systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation, introducing AR3D-R1 model with hierarchical RL optimization (Hi-GRPO) and new benchmark MME-3DR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been effective for 2D image generation but remains unexplored for 3D due to higher spatial complexity requiring globally consistent geometry and fine-grained textures, making 3D generation sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms.

Method: Systematic study across four dimensions: (1) Reward design evaluation focusing on human preference alignment and multi-modal models, (2) RL algorithm study of GRPO variants with token-level optimization, (3) Introduction of MME-3DR benchmark for implicit reasoning abilities, (4) Proposed Hi-GRPO for hierarchical global-to-local optimization with reward ensembles.

Result: Developed AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model that excels from coarse shape to texture refinement, with code released publicly.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation and demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical RL optimization for complex 3D generation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAT with IRM improves prostate cancer grading by iteratively selecting relevant patches and modeling spatial consistency via graph Laplacian constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate cancer grading from WSIs is challenging due to large image scale, heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing methods using random/static patch selection include redundant/non-informative regions that degrade performance.

Method: Propose Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) with Iterative Refinement Module (IRM). IRM iteratively refines patch selection using pretrained ResNet50 for local features and foundation model for importance scoring. GLAT models tissue connectivity via graph construction (patches as nodes), enforces spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints, and refines features via learnable filtering. Convex aggregation dynamically adjusts patch importance for WSI-level representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAT with IRM effectively addresses challenges in prostate cancer grading by combining iterative patch refinement with graph-based spatial modeling, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneMaker is a decoupled 3D scene generation framework that separates de-occlusion from 3D object generation and uses unified pose estimation to handle severe occlusion and open-set scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with producing high-quality geometry and accurate poses simultaneously under severe occlusion and open-set settings due to insufficient de-occlusion and pose estimation priors.

Method: 1) Decouple de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, enhanced with image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets; 2) Unified pose estimation model integrating global and local mechanisms for attention; 3) Construct open-set 3D scene dataset for generalization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority of the decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.

Conclusion: SceneMaker effectively addresses occlusion and open-set challenges in 3D scene generation through decoupled architecture and enhanced pose estimation.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

### [87] [Self-Ensemble Post Learning for Noisy Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10818)
*Wang Lu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEPL (Self-Ensemble Post Learning) improves domain generalization under label noise by leveraging intermediate features and ensemble learning to combat spurious feature enlargement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization (DG) faces performance degradation when encountering noisy labels, which exacerbate spurious feature enlargement in deep layers. Existing methods struggle when noise is present, creating a need for robust approaches that work under both distribution shift and label noise.

Method: SEPL consists of feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It trains multiple probing classifiers on intermediate feature representations using semi-supervised algorithms (to handle noisy labels), then integrates their predictions through crowdsourcing inference to leverage diverse feature focuses.

Result: Extensive experiments show SEPL enhances robustness of existing methods and demonstrates significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed SEPL approach effectively addresses the combined challenge of domain generalization and label noise by diversifying feature utilization through ensemble learning, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios where both issues commonly co-occur.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGAM is a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts 6D object pose from a query image and template images without explicit feature matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance on unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D object pose estimation methods for unseen objects rely on explicit feature correspondences between query images and object models/templates, which can be limiting. The authors aim to develop a more direct approach that eliminates explicit matching while incorporating geometry awareness.

Method: Built on multi-view foundation model architectures, PoseGAM integrates object geometry through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. The framework directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images without explicit matching.

Result: Extensive evaluations show state-of-the-art performance with average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods, achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets. The method demonstrates strong generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: PoseGAM successfully eliminates the need for explicit feature matching in 6D pose estimation while incorporating geometry awareness through complementary mechanisms, resulting in superior performance and generalization for unseen objects.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWiT-4D converts monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with 4D meshes using a sliding-window transformer approach that leverages existing image-to-3D priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D content generation struggles with converting monocular videos to animated 3D assets due to limited 4D mesh datasets, while image-to-3D generation has strong priors from extensive datasets that could be leveraged.

Method: Introduces SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer that integrates with any Diffusion Transformer-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving single-image forward process. Includes optimization-based trajectory module for global translation recovery in static-camera videos.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency with only single short (<10s) video fine-tuning. Outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness on in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, in-the-wild videos).

Conclusion: SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency and practical deployability under limited 4D supervision, effectively converting monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets by leveraging image-to-3D priors.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

TL;DR: MoCapAnything is a category-agnostic motion capture system that generates BVH animations for arbitrary 3D assets from monocular video prompts, using reference-guided factorization and constraint-aware inverse kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture pipelines are limited to specific species or templates, creating a gap for handling arbitrary 3D assets. The authors formalize this as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap) to enable scalable, prompt-driven motion capture for any rigged 3D model.

Method: A reference-guided, factorized framework with three learnable modules: (1) Reference Prompt Encoder extracts per-joint queries from asset skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) Video Feature Extractor computes visual descriptors and reconstructs coarse 4D deforming mesh; (3) Unified Motion Decoder fuses cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories, followed by constraint-aware inverse kinematics to recover asset-specific rotations.

Result: The system delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs. Experiments on in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos demonstrate effectiveness, supported by the curated Truebones Zoo dataset with 1038 motion clips.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything enables scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets, bridging the gap between video input and asset-specific animation output through a novel category-agnostic approach.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Motivation: Progress in table extraction has been difficult due to lack of annotated data, especially for multi-page table structure recognition and comprehensive page-level extraction.

Method: Created PubTables-v2 dataset supporting multiple table extraction tasks, then used it to evaluate domain-specialized vision-language models and develop POTATR (Page-Object Table Transformer), an image-to-graph extension of Table Transformer.

Result: PubTables-v2 enables benchmarking of multi-page table structure recognition for the first time, demonstrates current progress in table extraction, and supports development of comprehensive page-level extraction models.

Conclusion: PubTables-v2 addresses the data scarcity problem in table extraction research, enables evaluation of modern approaches, and facilitates development of more comprehensive table extraction systems like POTATR.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based SVG generation methods produce only text without visual signals during decoding, leading to struggles with complex semantics and poor visual/geometric coherence in generated SVGs.

Method: DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets to jointly generate image tokens and SVG tokens end-to-end, with a novel test-time scaling strategy that uses the model's visual predictions to guide SVG decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments show DuetSVG outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal generation with visual guidance significantly improves SVG quality, addressing limitations of text-only VLM approaches for complex visual semantics and geometric coherence.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states.

Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: Real-time talking head generation using Gaussian Splatting mapped to 3D Morphable Models with transformer-based audio-driven parameter prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-driven talking head methods have limitations: diffusion methods struggle with oneshot settings, while Gaussian Splatting approaches suffer from facial tracking inaccuracies and inconsistent mappings leading to unstable outputs and video artifacts that hinder realistic applications.

Method: Map Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars, and introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters directly from audio to drive temporal consistency. Works from monocular video and independent audio speech inputs.

Result: Enables generation of real-time talking head videos with competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the temporal instability and artifact issues in current talking head generation approaches by combining Gaussian Splatting with 3D Morphable Models and transformer-based audio parameter prediction, enabling realistic real-time applications.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a vision-language model using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous text embeddings instead of generating tokens, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and supporting selective decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-language models autoregressively generate tokens, which can be inefficient and focus on surface-level linguistic details rather than task-relevant semantics. The authors aim to create a more efficient model that learns in abstract representation space.

Method: VL-JEPA uses a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous embeddings of target texts rather than generating tokens. It operates in an abstract representation space, and at inference time uses a lightweight text decoder only when needed to translate embeddings into text.

Result: VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance than standard token-space VLM training with 50% fewer trainable parameters. It supports selective decoding (2.85x fewer decoding operations), outperforms CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder on video tasks, and achieves comparable performance to larger VLMs on VQA datasets despite having only 1.6B parameters.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates that predicting continuous embeddings in joint embedding space is more efficient than token generation for vision-language tasks, offering better performance with fewer parameters while supporting multiple applications without architectural changes.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

TL;DR: MeViS dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation with 33K motion expressions, benchmarking shows limitations of existing methods, new SOTA approach LMPM++ proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring video segmentation datasets focus on static attributes and salient objects, underemphasizing motion. Need to explore motion expressions and motion reasoning for pixel-level video understanding in complex scenarios.

Method: Introduce MeViS dataset with 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions (text/audio), 8,171 objects in 2,006 complex videos. Benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks. Propose LMPM++ approach for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Result: Benchmarking reveals weaknesses in existing methods for motion expression-guided video understanding. LMPM++ achieves new state-of-the-art results on RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Conclusion: MeViS provides platform for developing motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms. Dataset and code publicly available to advance research in complex video scene understanding.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/

TL;DR: Flex is a geometry-agnostic scene encoder that uses learnable scene tokens to jointly encode multi-camera driving data across timesteps, achieving 2.2x faster inference with improved performance compared to 3D-prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in autonomous driving, challenging the prevailing assumption that explicit 3D inductive biases (BEV, occupancy, tri-plane) are necessary for effective scene encoding.

Method: Uses a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. Geometry-agnostic approach learns compact scene representation directly from data without relying on explicit 3D inductive biases.

Result: Achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin on 20,000-hour proprietary dataset. Scene tokens develop emergent capability for scene decomposition without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers more scalable, efficient, and effective path for autonomous driving systems than 3D-prior approaches, challenging the assumption that 3D priors are necessary.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: ClusIR is a cluster-guided image restoration framework that uses learnable clustering to model degradation semantics and adaptively restore images across diverse degradations through spatial and frequency domain modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing All-in-One Image Restoration methods fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations, limiting their effectiveness in handling diverse real-world degradation scenarios.

Method: ClusIR uses two key components: 1) Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) that disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation for discriminative perception and stable routing, and 2) Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM) that leverages cluster-guided priors for adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation to refine structural and textural representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance across a wide range of degradation scenarios, achieving remarkable restoration results by bridging semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation.

Conclusion: ClusIR successfully addresses the limitations of existing AiOIR methods by explicitly modeling degradation semantics through learnable clustering and enabling adaptive restoration through cluster-guided synergy across spatial and frequency domains, making it effective for diverse real-world degradation scenarios.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-RayZer is a self-supervised 3D vision model that learns 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled multi-view images through explicit 3D reconstruction, outperforming previous methods on 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised pre-training has transformed foundation models for languages, 2D images, and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. Current methods like RayZer infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis rather than operating directly in 3D space.

Method: E-RayZer performs self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry directly in 3D space, eliminating shortcut solutions. It introduces a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an unsupervised manner for convergence and scalability.

Result: E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models like VGGT. Its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks.

Conclusion: E-RayZer establishes a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training by learning truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images through explicit 3D reconstruction, offering geometrically grounded representations that excel in 3D downstream tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group Diffusion enables collaborative image generation by sharing attention across multiple images during inference, achieving significant FID improvements through cross-sample attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion models generate images independently at inference, missing potential benefits from collaborative generation where samples could be generated together rather than in isolation.

Method: Proposes Group Diffusion which unlocks attention mechanisms to be shared across images (inter-image) rather than just within patches of a single image (intra-image), enabling joint denoising of multiple images at inference time.

Result: Shows clear scaling effect where larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality, achieving up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256, with qualitative measures correlating closely with FID.

Conclusion: Cross-sample inference represents an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling that enables collaborative generation and significant quality improvements in diffusion models.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Attribute introduces an open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that learns disentangled, attribute-specific representations for precise visual concept personalization, addressing the limitations of holistic embeddings that entangle multiple visual factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual concept personalization methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate single attributes, leading to information leakage and incoherent synthesis.

Method: Joint data-model design: (i) curating semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive/negative attributes to teach what to preserve/suppress, and (ii) adopting a dual-objective training paradigm balancing generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement.

Result: The resulting embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute successfully addresses the disentanglement problem in visual concept personalization through a novel data curation and training approach, enabling high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations for various applications.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoWalker enhances robot navigation foundation models by incorporating stereo vision and explicit mid-level vision modules, achieving better performance with far less training data than monocular-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation foundation models rely solely on monocular vision and ignore mid-level vision modules, which is inefficient and requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision. Monocular approaches struggle with depth-scale ambiguity and lack precise geometric understanding needed for dynamic, unstructured environments.

Method: StereoWalker augments navigation foundation models with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules including depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. The approach also introduces a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos.

Result: StereoWalker achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of training data, surpasses state-of-the-art with full data, and demonstrates that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Conclusion: Incorporating stereo vision and explicit mid-level vision modules is more efficient and effective than relying solely on monocular vision for robot navigation foundation models, addressing depth-scale ambiguity and improving geometric understanding in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

TL;DR: WorldLens is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating generative world models across five dimensions: visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability, with a dataset and evaluation agent for scalable assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative world models produce visually convincing 4D driving environments but often fail physically or behaviorally, lacking unified evaluation methods to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control.

Method: Introduces WorldLens benchmark with five evaluation aspects (Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, Human Preference), creates WorldLens-26K dataset of human-annotated videos with scores and rationales, and develops WorldLens-Agent evaluation model distilled from human annotations.

Result: No existing world model excels universally across all dimensions - models with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. The benchmark reveals trade-offs between different aspects of world generation quality.

Conclusion: WorldLens provides a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity, standardizing evaluation of generative world models not just by visual realism but by behavioral realism, enabling more comprehensive assessment of how well models build, understand, and behave within generated worlds.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

*Tjark Behrens,Anton Obukhov,Bingxin Ke,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoSpace is a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that uses viewpoint conditioning instead of explicit depth or warping, achieving state-of-the-art results with a new evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo synthesis methods rely on explicit depth estimation and warping, which can be limited in handling complex scenes with disocclusions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and layered geometry. The paper aims to develop a more robust, depth-free approach that directly models geometric relationships through viewpoint conditioning.

Method: StereoSpace uses a diffusion-based framework with viewpoint conditioning to model geometry implicitly. It operates in a canonical rectified space where the generator learns to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. The method introduces a novel evaluation protocol that excludes ground truth or proxy geometry at test time to prevent data leakage.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms existing methods across warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories. It achieves sharp parallax and strong robustness on challenging scenes including layered and non-Lambertian surfaces. The method excels in both perceptual comfort (iSQoE) and geometric consistency (MEt3R) metrics.

Conclusion: Viewpoint-conditioned diffusion provides a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation that eliminates the need for explicit geometric modeling while maintaining strong performance on complex scenes. The proposed evaluation protocol ensures fair comparison by preventing test-time geometry leakage.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonprehensile manipulation like pushing objects in cluttered environments is challenging due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements.

Method: Hierarchical approach with high-level RL agent selecting intermediate spatial goals, and low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model generating feasible trajectories to reach those goals.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations in 2D simulation.

Conclusion: Hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is promising for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects across cluttered environments, presents a challenging control problem due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements. In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.
  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial 6-axis robotic arms often perform functionally redundant operations (effectively 5-axis tasks) in manufacturing applications like welding and additive manufacturing. Current approaches underutilize fast inverse kinematics algorithms in favor of computationally expensive offline planning methods, limiting workspace optimization and toolpath feasibility.

Method: Proposed algorithm combines task space decomposition, damped least-squares method, and Halley's method to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics. This approach enables fast, robust solutions with reduced joint motion for robotic manipulation tasks.

Result: The algorithm quickly solves motion plans that minimize joint motion and expands feasible operating space for complex toolpaths. Successfully validated on an industrial ABB manipulator with cold-spray gun executing computed toolpaths for non-planar surface coating applications.

Conclusion: The proposed functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm provides fast, reactive solutions for robotic manipulation tasks, enabling better workspace utilization and toolpath optimization compared to traditional offline planning methods, particularly beneficial for manufacturing applications like cold spray coating.

Abstract: Industrial automation with six-axis robotic arms is critical for many manufacturing tasks, including welding and additive manufacturing applications; however, many of these operations are functionally redundant due to the symmetrical tool axis, which effectively makes the operation a five-axis task. Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.

### [109] [Inertial Magnetic SLAM Systems Using Low-Cost Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10128)
*Chuan Huang,Gustaf Hendeby,Isaac Skog*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes two inertial-magnetic SLAM systems (loosely and tightly coupled) using low-cost IMU, magnetometer array, and barometer for positioning in low-visibility conditions without requiring visual odometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing magnetic field-based SLAM systems require low-drift odometry from visual or wheel sensors, limiting their use in unmapped regions. Need for positioning systems robust to low-visibility conditions using non-visual sensors.

Method: Two IM-SLAM systems: loosely coupled uses separate state-space models for local and global magnetic field models; tightly coupled integrates both models into single state-space model. Both use IMU, magnetometer array, and barometer.

Result: Tightly coupled system achieves lower positioning errors than loosely coupled in most scenarios, with typical errors on order of meters per 100 meters traveled.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of full 3D IM-SLAM using low-cost sensors, with potential applications in emergency response scenarios like mine/fire rescue where visibility is limited.

Abstract: Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using Contextual Reward Machines for task-oriented grasping that decomposes tasks into sub-tasks with stage-specific contexts, achieving 95% success in simulation and 83.3% in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-oriented grasping is complex and challenging for reinforcement learning due to large state-action spaces and exploration difficulties. Existing methods struggle with efficiency and success rates in diverse grasping scenarios.

Method: Proposes Contextual Reward Machine that decomposes grasping tasks into sub-tasks with stage-specific contexts (reward function, action space, state abstraction). Uses transition rewards between stages and integrates with Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.

Result: Achieved 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks with diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. Outperformed state-of-the-art in learning speed and success rate. Transferred to real robot with 83.3% success in 60 tasks over six affordances.

Conclusion: The Contextual Reward Machine framework demonstrates superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency for task-oriented grasping, showing potential to advance both simulated and real-world robotic grasping applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Contextual Reward Machine for task-oriented grasping. The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings.

*Luís Marques,Maani Ghaffari,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLAPS is a symmetry-aware conformal prediction method that provides guaranteed prediction sets for robot configurations under uncertainty, extending guarantees from Euclidean to Lie group spaces like SE(2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods either make strong assumptions about error distributions or rely on uncalibrated estimates, which are insufficient for safe robot control. Current conformal prediction methods treat robots as Euclidean points, but many robotic systems have non-Euclidean configuration spaces (like SE(2) for mobile robots).

Method: Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS) uses symmetry-aware conformal prediction with Lie group analysis to extend theoretical guarantees from Euclidean spaces to SE(2). The method constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at user-defined probability levels, using symmetry-informed nonconformity scores.

Result: Experiments on simulated JetBot and real MBot show that CLAPS produces more volume-efficient prediction regions that better represent underlying uncertainty compared to existing approaches, while providing non-asymptotic guarantees under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: CLAPS successfully extends conformal prediction to non-Euclidean configuration spaces using Lie group theory, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for robotic systems with guaranteed coverage probabilities, enabling safer control without requiring strong assumptions about system dynamics or uncertainty sources.

Abstract: We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.

Result: Robot navigates agricultural terrain overcoming 15cm obstacles, achieves 86.2% weed detection rate at 42.5 cm/s, 97% hit rate with 1.54mm mean positional error, operating 87 seconds per meter.

Conclusion: The robot demonstrates potential for enhancing precision farming through effective, accurate, and efficient laser-based weed removal with high stability and navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tendon-driven under-actuated robotic fingers offer advantages for dexterous manipulation but struggle to achieve both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in compact form. Current designs require trade-offs between actuator count, stiffness, and compliance.

Method: Developed an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) with synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios. This allows entire finger to be actuated by single actuator. Derived kinematic and static models incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness.

Result: Prototype showed average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under 3 kg tip load. Five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrated effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Synchronous tendon routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with minimal actuator count, enabling lightweight and compact multi-finger robotic hands without sacrificing stiffness or compliance.

Abstract: Tendon-driven under-actuated robotic fingers provide advantages for dexterous manipulation through reduced actuator requirements and simplified mechanical design. However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language large models underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks, despite their strong reasoning abilities. The paper aims to bridge this gap by combining the strengths of both model types for better navigation performance.

Method: Proposes CLASH framework with: 1) Reactive Small-Model Planner (RSMP) using causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture, 2) Reflective Large-Model Reasoner (RLMR) using panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning, 3) Uncertainty-aware Collaboration Mechanism (UCM) for adaptive decision fusion, and 4) Enhanced obstacle avoidance with learnable point-goal policy (simulation) and LiDAR-based clustering with SLAM controller (real-world).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results (ranking 1st) on VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on test-unseen set. Real-world experiments demonstrate strong robustness and effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: CLASH successfully integrates large and small models for VLN tasks, demonstrating that hierarchical collaboration with uncertainty-aware fusion can overcome limitations of individual model types and achieve superior navigation performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires robots to follow natural language instructions and navigate complex environments without prior maps. While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods. Real-world experiments demonstrate CLASH's strong robustness, validating its effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Current embodied AI systems face severe engineering impediments, primarily characterized by poor cross-scenario adaptability, rigid inter-module coupling, and fragmented inference acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.

TL;DR: Symphony algorithm trains humanoid robots from scratch with sample efficiency and safety using swaddling regularization, limited parametric noise, and fading replay buffer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots learning from scratch can't wait millions of steps like human development; need safe, sample-efficient training that protects both environment and robot mechanisms.

Method: Symphony algorithm combines swaddling regularization (penalizing action strength), limited parametric noise (safer than Gaussian noise), fading replay buffer (recent + long-term memory), and temporal advantage for single-pass updates.

Result: Empirically safer training for both environment and robot mechanisms; enables training humanoid robots from scratch with sample efficiency, proximity, and safety.

Conclusion: Symphony provides a concise, safe approach for training humanoid robots from scratch by combining regularization, controlled noise, and efficient memory management.

Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

Motivation: Accurate and continuous pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor environments is challenging due to complementary but individually fragile technologies (GNSS, UWB, inertial PDR) suffering from signal blockage, multipath, and drift.

Method: Unified fusion framework using chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as motion backbone, integrating absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. Introduces lightweight map-based feasibility constraint from OpenStreetMap building footprints to enhance transition robustness.

Implemented in ROS 2 with real-time wearable platform and Foxglove visualization.

Result: Evaluated three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR). Results show that the ESKF (error-state extended Kalman filter) provides the most consistent overall performance in their implementation.

Conclusion: The unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework with map-based constraints enables seamless pedestrian localization across environments, with ESKF demonstrating superior performance among the three probabilistic back-ends tested.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor environments remains challenging because GNSS, UWB, and inertial PDR are complementary yet individually fragile under signal blockage, multipath, and drift. This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR). Results show that the ESKF provides the most consistent overall performance in our implementation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision is often occluded in contact-rich manipulation tasks, preventing robots from obtaining real-time scene state information through visual feedback (blind manipulation).

Method: Proposes Contact SLAM - a physically-driven contact cognition method that estimates environment state using only tactile sensing and prior scene knowledge, plus an active exploration policy to maximize efficiency by gradually reducing uncertainties.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and accuracy in several contact-rich tasks, including difficult socket assembly and block-pushing tasks.

Conclusion: Contact SLAM provides a viable solution for blind manipulation by enabling robots to perceive and manipulate in occluded environments using tactile sensing and active exploration.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.

Conclusion: IR-ULSG framework effectively addresses UWB limitations in real-world scenarios, providing robust and accurate GPS-denied localization even in challenging environments with multi-path interference and limited anchor availability.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) has shown promising potential in GPS-denied localization thanks to its lightweight and drift-free characteristics, while the accuracy is limited in real scenarios due to its sensitivity to sensor arrangement and non-Gaussian pattern induced by multi-path or multi-signal interference, which commonly occurs in many typical applications like long tunnels. We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IR-ULSG in handling challenging conditions, including scenarios outside the convex envelope and cases where only a single anchor is available.

Conclusion: Mr. Virgil provides a robust solution for multi-robot relative localization that eliminates dependency on specialized hardware or delicate tuning while maintaining accuracy under various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB)-vision fusion localization has achieved extensive applications in the domain of multi-agent relative localization. The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

TL;DR: Computer-generated parafoil trajectories outperform human pilots by 20-80% in safety and efficiency, offering potential for improved training simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most skydiving accidents happen during parafoil piloting/landing due to human judgment errors. Current training lacks functional simulators, and there's limited research on trajectory planning for human training.

Method: Adapted Stable Sparse RRT (SST) sampling-based motion planner to compute safe trajectories while minimizing bank angle (control effort) as a safety proxy. Compared computer-generated solutions with human flight data.

Result: Algorithm achieved 20-80% relative cost improvement over human pilots. Computer trajectories make smoother, gradual descents arriving at precise altitude for final approach, while humans tend to close horizontal distance first then spiral down.

Conclusion: Computer-generated guidelines show potential to replace traditional rules of thumb for parafoil training, enabling safer and more cost-effective flights through integration into future simulators.

Abstract: Most skydiving accidents occur during the parafoil-piloting and landing stages and result from human lapses in judgment while piloting the parafoil. Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\%-80\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot task planning studies focus on single-task scenarios and single robot types with complex structures lacking generalizability, creating a need for a more streamlined and adaptable framework.

Method: A streamlined framework allowing LLMs to independently think, plan, and act, featuring modular/registrable toolset for flexible tool calling and human-robot interaction mechanisms for collaborative partnership.

Result: The framework successfully adapts to mainstream robot platforms (UAVs, robotic arms, wheeled robots) and efficiently executes various tasks with different complexity levels.

Conclusion: LEO-RobotAgent provides a practical solution for general-purpose language-driven robot control with strong generalization capabilities and enhanced human-robot interaction.

Abstract: We propose LEO-RobotAgent, a general-purpose language-driven intelligent agent framework for robots. Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Video foundation models (Veo) enable comprehensive robot policy evaluation including OOD generalization and safety testing through realistic scene editing and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models in robotics are limited to in-distribution evaluations, missing the ability to test policies in novel scenarios, assess generalization, and probe safety constraints.

Method: Developed a generative evaluation system using Veo video foundation model with robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, integrated with generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic scene variations.

Result: System accurately predicts relative policy performance in both nominal and OOD conditions, identifies impact of different generalization axes, and exposes safety violations through 1600+ real-world evaluations of 8 policy checkpoints across 5 bimanual manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Video foundation models can serve as comprehensive evaluation platforms for robotics, enabling testing across the full spectrum from nominal performance to OOD generalization and safety assessment.

Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.

*Jianbo Wang,Galina Sidorenko,Johan Thunberg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid DRL + analytical method improves safety in multi-vehicle emergency braking scenarios with better harm reduction and reliability than standalone DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs need safety requirements (collision avoidance, harm mitigation) but conservative worst-case strategies reduce flexibility and performance. Need ethical emergency braking decisions for collective harm reduction in multi-vehicle scenarios.

Method: Hybrid approach combining Deep Reinforcement Learning with V2V communication and previously published analytical method for optimal constant deceleration selection.

Result: Hybrid approach increases reliability compared to standalone DRL while achieving superior performance in overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.

Conclusion: Combining DRL with analytical methods provides more reliable and effective safety solutions for multi-vehicle emergency braking scenarios in CAV deployments.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.

Abstract: This work deals with the problem of stabilizing a multi-agent rigid formation on a general class of planar curves. Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Aerial manipulators face complex dynamics challenges; proposed regime-conditioned diffusion framework models residual forces using conditional diffusion and temporal encoder for improved control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial manipulators experience rapid, configuration-dependent changes in inertial coupling and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling difficult. Analytical models lose fidelity under nonlinear/nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods fail to represent diverse residual behaviors across different operating conditions.

Method: Proposed a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts compact summary of recent motion/configuration for consistent residual predictions through transitions or unseen payloads.

Result: When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The regime-conditioned diffusion framework effectively addresses the core challenge of accurate dynamics modeling for aerial manipulators by capturing complex residual behaviors, enabling reliable control even under nonlinear/nonstationary effects and unseen conditions.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators undergo rapid, configuration-dependent changes in inertial coupling forces and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling a core challenge for reliable control. Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.

TL;DR: A semantic compositional diffusion transformer generates robotic manipulation data for unseen task combinations by factorizing transitions into components and learning their interactions, with iterative self-improvement via offline RL validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive and impractical for the combinatorially large space of tasks in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. Existing generative models don't exploit compositional structure and struggle with unseen task combinations.

Method: Proposes a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Includes iterative self-improvement where synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds.

Result: The approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating emergence of meaningful compositional structure in learned representations.

Conclusion: The semantic compositional diffusion transformer enables effective zero-shot generation of robotic manipulation data for unseen task combinations through compositional factorization and iterative self-improvement, addressing the combinatorial explosion problem in robotic domains.

Abstract: Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.

*Zamirddine Mari,Jérôme Pasquet,Julien Seinturier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-based drone navigation in unknown 3D tubes using LiDAR and visual detection, outperforming deterministic controllers despite information asymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments is challenging due to constraining geometry, wall proximity, and perceptual limitations. Applications include industrial, underground, or medical scenarios where navigating narrow, weakly perceptive conduits is essential.

Method: Reinforcement learning approach using PPO policy with local LiDAR observations and conditional visual detection of tube center. Trained via progressive Curriculum Learning with turning-negotiation mechanism combining direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues.

Result: The RL policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic Pure Pursuit baseline despite having limited geometric information. Validation in high-fidelity 3D environment confirms transferability to continuous physical dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments, opening perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow conduits is challenging.

Abstract: Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.
  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ImplicitRDP is a unified visual-force diffusion policy that integrates slow vision and fast force sensing for contact-rich manipulation using structural slow-fast learning and representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human manipulation uses vision for spatial context and force sensing for rapid contact dynamics, but integrating these disparate modalities is challenging due to frequency and informational differences.

Method: Proposes ImplicitRDP with Structural Slow-Fast Learning using causal attention for asynchronous visual/force tokens, and Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization to prevent modality collapse.

Result: Significantly outperforms vision-only and hierarchical baselines on contact-rich tasks, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with streamlined training.

Conclusion: ImplicitRDP successfully integrates vision and force sensing for contact-rich manipulation through unified end-to-end learning with specialized architectural components.

Abstract: Human-level contact-rich manipulation relies on the distinct roles of two key modalities: vision provides spatially rich but temporally slow global context, while force sensing captures rapid, high-frequency local contact dynamics. Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline. Code and videos will be publicly available at https://implicit-rdp.github.io.

Conclusion: ExaCraft represents an innovative approach to personalized education by dynamically adapting example generation to learners' evolving context, addressing gaps in existing educational AI tools.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

TL;DR: Two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: first uses LLMs to compute agreement scores on evidence, then triggers multi-agent debate when consensus is low, achieving better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation is proliferating online, requiring effective verification that combines high-quality evidence retrieval with rigorous reasoning processes.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Agreement Score Prediction using LLMs to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute aggregated agreement scores; 2) Multi-Agent Debate triggered when scores fall below threshold, where multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate justified verdicts.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to baseline methods, demonstrating the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage approach effectively combines evidence evaluation with structured debate, providing a robust framework for health misinformation detection that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography interpretation is cognitively demanding and performed manually, while existing AI models operate in isolation on individual subtasks without providing unified, clinically coherent assessments.

Method: Uses a large language model in a ReAct-style loop to orchestrate specialized tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis, integrating outputs into guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieves 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models, and demonstrates ability to resolve challenging borderline cases using quantitative measurements and physiologic context.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot provides a unified framework for comprehensive echocardiography assessment by orchestrating specialized tools through LLM-based reasoning, showing promise for clinical decision support in complex cardiac cases.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: SciEx offers a practical solution for scientific information extraction that addresses current limitations through modular design, enabling on-demand extraction with extensibility for evolving scientific data needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently.

Conclusion: DynaMate represents an automated framework that enables standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for biomolecular and drug design applications by overcoming technical barriers in MD simulation setup through autonomous workflow execution.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for robotics focus mainly on indoor scenarios, lacking capabilities for complex urban environments with dynamic elements like pedestrians and traffic systems.

Method: Built SimWorld-Robotics (SWR) on Unreal Engine 5 with procedurally generated photorealistic urban scenes, dynamic elements, and multi-robot support. Created two benchmarks: multimodal instruction-following navigation and multi-agent search with communication.

Result: State-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with the tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities needed for realistic urban environments.

Conclusion: SWR provides a scalable, realistic platform for developing and evaluating embodied AI in urban settings, revealing significant gaps in current models' capabilities for complex real-world robotics tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

### [138] [Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054)
*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces a parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning adapters that enable parallel decoding streams to coordinate via shared latent space, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction without modifying base model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs creates latency bottlenecks that scale linearly with output length. Existing parallelization methods like Skeleton-of-Thought suffer from coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication.

Method: PDT uses lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters injected into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing parallel decoding streams to synchronize via shared dynamic latent space. Coordination is formulated as a speculative consensus problem where streams broadcast semantic notes to a global bus gated by a learned verification head.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights, validated on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone.

Conclusion: PDT establishes a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation by embedding coordination primitives directly into inference while keeping the base model frozen.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

### [139] [Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058)
*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantitative study reveals deep structural divide between AI safety and AI ethics communities, with over 80% of collaborations occurring within silos and cross-field connectivity concentrated among just 5% of papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI alignment research has diverged into two parallel tracks (safety vs ethics) with different meanings of "alignment," methodologies, and institutional homes, creating an urgent need to understand and bridge this divide.

Method: Large-scale bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML/NLP conferences (2020-2025) to quantify collaboration patterns and structural segregation.

Result: Over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics communities; cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated (5% of papers account for >85% of bridging links); removing key brokers sharply increases segregation.

Conclusion: The safety-ethics divide is both conceptual and institutional; integration via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

### [140] [Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065)
*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes from indirect cues like names/occupations in linear activation space representations, which shape downstream behaviors like career recommendations, revealing implicit biases even in models passing bias tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs encode and leverage sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners from indirect cues, and to investigate whether models passing bias benchmarks still harbor implicit biases that affect their behavior.

Method: Probed residual streams across layers of four transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure, then tested same probes on implicit cues (names, occupations) to show they activate census-aligned gender/race representations and workforce statistics correlations.

Result: LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics in activation space, with stereotypically associated attributes encoded along interpretable geometric directions; these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior like career recommendations; models passing bias tests still harbor and leverage implicit biases.

Conclusion: LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes in linear activation representations from indirect cues, which influence their behavior despite passing bias benchmarks, highlighting significant fairness implications when deployed at scale.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE embeddings from sparse autoencoders provide interpretable, cost-effective representations for analyzing text corpora, outperforming LLM-based methods and dense embeddings in controllability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing large text corpora rely on expensive LLM-based techniques or dense embeddings that lack control over properties of interest, creating a need for more interpretable and controllable representations.

Method: Propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings - representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts, enabling controlled analysis through concept filtering and comparison.

Result: SAE embeddings uncover 2-8x bigger differences at lower cost than LLMs, identify biases more reliably, enable controllable clustering along axes of interest, and outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval.

Conclusion: SAEs serve as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis, highlighting the importance of interpreting models through their data and providing interpretable, cost-effective alternatives to existing methods.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify fundamental limitations in AI robustness, security, and alignment that are inherent to the technology itself, which is critical for responsible AI adoption and understanding what AI can and cannot achieve.

Method: Extends Gödel's incompleteness theorem to artificial intelligence systems, establishing information-theoretic limitations through mathematical proof and theoretical analysis.

Result: Proves that there are inherent, unavoidable limitations to AI robustness, security, and alignment capabilities, similar to the fundamental limits Gödel established for formal mathematical systems.

Conclusion: AI systems face fundamental limitations in security, alignment, and cognitive reasoning that cannot be overcome, requiring practical approaches to work within these constraints and careful consideration of AI's capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: This manuscript establishes information-theoretic limitations for robustness of AI security and alignment by extending Gödel's incompleteness theorem to AI. Knowing these limitations and preparing for the challenges they bring is critically important for the responsible adoption of the AI technology. Practical approaches to dealing with these challenges are provided as well. Broader implications for cognitive reasoning limitations of AI systems are also proven.

*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Abhay Goyal,Lam Yin Cheung,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers analyze conspiratorial narratives in Singapore Telegram groups using a two-stage framework: RoBERTa classification and Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) to identify 7 narrative archetypes, showing conspiracy content is woven into everyday discussions rather than isolated echo chambers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded in digital ecosystems but difficult to study. The research aims to understand how such content spreads and is structured within everyday online discussions, challenging assumptions about isolated echo chambers.

Method: Two-stage computational framework: 1) Fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial (F1-score 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages), 2) Build signed belief graph with nodes as messages and edge signs reflecting belief alignment, weighted by textual similarity, then use Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) with Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings separating ideological alignment from stylistic features.

Result: Identified 7 narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN achieved superior clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) vs baselines (13.60-67.27) with 88% inter-rater expert agreement. Found conspiratorial messages appear within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters.

Conclusion: Conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction, challenging assumptions about online radicalization. The framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis with applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

*Mesafint Fanuel,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Crystal Cook Marshal,Vishal Lakhotia,Biswanath Dari,Kaushik Roy,Shaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriRegion is a RAG framework that reduces agricultural hallucinations in LLMs by incorporating geospatial metadata and region-prioritized retrieval for locally accurate farming advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs suffer from contextual hallucination in agriculture, providing advice that may be scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations.

Method: AgriRegion uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework with geospatial metadata injection and region-prioritized re-ranking, restricting knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval.

Result: AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLM systems and significantly improves trust scores according to comprehensive evaluation on the novel AgriRegion-Eval benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The AgriRegion framework effectively addresses region-specific agricultural advisory needs by ensuring locally accurate advice through geospatial-aware retrieval mechanisms, representing an important advancement for agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index shows transparency among AI companies has worsened, with average scores dropping from 58 to 40 out of 100, with IBM as a positive outlier and xAI/Midjourney as the least transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track how transparency practices of major foundation model developers evolve as these companies become increasingly important, and to provide policymakers with insights on current transparency levels and needed interventions.

Method: Annual index evaluating foundation model developers using quantitative indicators, with 2025 edition introducing new metrics for data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring, and expanding evaluation to include companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI.

Result: Transparency has deteriorated: average score fell from 58 (2024) to 40 (2025). Companies are most opaque about training data, compute, and post-deployment impact. IBM scored highest (95), while xAI and Midjourney scored lowest (14). Frontier Model Forum members scored in the middle.

Conclusion: Transparency progress has reversed despite increasing policy mandates. Companies lack incentives to lead on transparency, avoiding reputational harm but not excelling. More aggressive policy interventions are needed to address critical information deficits in the foundation model ecosystem.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

TL;DR: CP-Env is a controllable agentic hospital environment that evaluates LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways, revealing that most models struggle with pathway complexity despite excessive reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate LLMs in dynamic clinical scenarios with complex pathways and transitions between care stages.

Method: CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, enabling branching, long-horizon task execution following real hospital adaptive flow. It uses a three-tiered evaluation framework: Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics.

Result: Most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Excessive reasoning steps can be counterproductive, while top models show reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge.

Conclusion: CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation, providing benchmark and evaluation tools for further research.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation.

### [147] [An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208)
*Mehmet Emin Aydin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is proposed to optimize operator sequences in search algorithms, addressing efficiency challenges in optimization processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization algorithms face efficiency challenges, and while using multiple operators instead of single operators shows promise, finding optimal operator sequences remains difficult. Multi-objective optimization cases have received less attention than single-objective cases in this area.

Method: A multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that generalizes experiences to determine optimal operator sequences for neighborhood move operations in optimization algorithms.

Result: The paper presents an overview of a proposed generalisation approach with some stages completed and others outstanding, suggesting it offers promising solutions to efficiency challenges.

Conclusion: Multi-objective reinforcement learning appears to be a promising remedy for optimizing operator sequences in search processes, potentially demonstrating improved efficiency in optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Predict-and-Search framework to parametric MIPs with ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning approach that handles heterogeneous variables better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Predict-and-Search methods are limited to binary problems and don't handle fixed variables well, despite these being common in real-world applications. There's a need to extend the framework to more general parametric MIPs with heterogeneous variables.

Method: Introduces ID-PaS (Identity-aware Predict-and-Search), a learning framework that extends PaS to parametric MIPs. The method enables ML models to effectively handle heterogeneous variables by incorporating identity awareness into the prediction process.

Result: Experiments on real-world large-scale problems show ID-PaS consistently outperforms both the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and the original PaS framework.

Conclusion: ID-PaS successfully extends the Predict-and-Search paradigm to parametric MIPs with heterogeneous variables, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches and addressing practical limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

### [149] [Reverse Thinking Enhances Missing Information Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10273)
*Yuxin Liu,Chaojie Gu,Yihang Zhang,Bin Qian,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with missing information problems, causing incomplete responses and hallucinations. This paper proposes a reverse thinking framework that transforms missing information detection into backward reasoning, significantly improving accuracy over traditional forward methods like CoT and ToT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong reasoning capabilities but often fail when dealing with problems containing missing information, leading to incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. Traditional forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought don't systematically identify or recover omitted information, creating a gap in LLM reasoning robustness.

Method: Proposes a novel reverse thinking framework inspired by backward reasoning. The approach guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements, transforming missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem rather than forward reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods. The reverse thinking approach significantly improves model accuracy on missing information detection tasks, demonstrating enhanced logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: Reverse thinking methodologies provide a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' performance on problems with missing information. The framework successfully addresses limitations of forward reasoning approaches and improves reasoning completeness, offering a valuable advancement for LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

### [150] [Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC) for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10282)
*Waleed Razzaq,Izis Kankaraway,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAC (Neuronal Attention Circuit) is a continuous-time attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits as solutions to linear ODEs using biologically-inspired sparse gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics with theoretical guarantees and competitive performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms improve representation learning but their discrete nature limits continuous-time modeling capabilities. The authors aim to create a biologically plausible continuous-time attention mechanism that can handle irregular time-series data while maintaining efficiency.

Method: NAC reformulates attention logits computation as solving a linear first-order ODE using nonlinear interlinked gates derived from C. elegans Neuronal Circuit Policies. It replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and uses a sparse backbone network with two heads for content-target and learnable time-constant gates. Supports three computation modes: explicit Euler integration, exact closed-form solution, and steady-state approximation. Includes sparse Top-K pairwise concatenation for memory efficiency.

Result: NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy across irregular time-series classification, autonomous vehicle lane-keeping, and industrial prognostics. It occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared to other continuous-time baselines.

Conclusion: NAC successfully bridges discrete attention mechanisms with continuous-time modeling through biologically inspired sparse gating, providing theoretical guarantees (state stability, bounded errors, universal approximation) while maintaining practical efficiency and competitive performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers propose an interpretability framework to analyze vision-language models' attention heads using a new dataset (CogVision) that decomposes multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions with specific cognitive functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models excel on benchmarks but remain black boxes; there's a need to understand their internal mechanisms, particularly how attention heads function in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created CogVision dataset with chain-of-thought subquestions tagged with cognitive functions; used probing methodology to identify functional attention heads; conducted intervention experiments by removing/emphasizing these heads.

Result: Functional heads are sparse, vary across functions and models, mediate interactions hierarchically; removing them degrades performance while emphasizing them enhances accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides insights into VLM cognitive organization and suggests directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The framework ensures AI execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control, addressing the accountability gap in consequential AI decision-making systems.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

TL;DR: InfoCom is an information-aware framework that achieves near-lossless collaborative perception with 440x communication reduction by optimizing task-critical information extraction via Information Bottleneck principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative perception methods face a fundamental communication-performance trade-off, assuming MB-level data transmission that fails under practical network constraints, requiring more communication-efficient solutions.

Method: InfoCom introduces an information purification paradigm with three core innovations: 1) Information-Aware Encoding to condense features into minimal messages, 2) Sparse Mask Generation to identify spatial cues with negligible cost, and 3) Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers information through mask-guided mechanisms.

Result: InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold reduction per agent compared to Where2comm and 90-fold reduction compared to ERMVP.

Conclusion: InfoCom establishes a pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via Information Bottleneck principles, enabling practical deployment under real-world network constraints while maintaining high perception performance.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

*Mumuksh Tayal,Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-OCBF learns neural Control Barrier Functions from offline data without dynamics models, enabling safe control synthesis without online interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Safe Offline RL methods only enforce soft constraints without forward invariance guarantees, while CBFs require expert-designed barriers or full dynamics knowledge. Need offline-learned safety guarantees without model access.

Method: Learn neural CBF from offline demonstrations using recursive finite-difference barrier update (model-free). Use expectile-based objective to avoid OOD actions and restrict updates to dataset-supported actions. Synthesize safe control via QP with learned barrier.

Result: V-OCBF achieves substantially fewer safety violations than baselines while maintaining strong task performance across multiple case studies.

Conclusion: V-OCBF enables scalable offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers, bridging offline RL and CBF approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A user-feedback-driven adaptation framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that integrates human interactions into continual learning, converting user feedback into training data and using memory-bank warm-start to improve navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) frameworks exclude valuable user feedback, relying only on unsupervised adaptation from environmental exposure. User feedback offers natural supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality for real-world deployment.

Method: Introduces a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that systematically integrates human interactions into continual learning. Converts user feedback (navigation instructions and corrective signals) into high-quality, environment-aligned training data. Uses a memory-bank warm-start mechanism to reuse previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment.

Result: Experiments on GSA-R2R benchmark show consistent improvement over strong baselines like GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. Memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results confirm robustness and generality under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that integrating user feedback into GSA-VLN enables efficient and realistic adaptation, with sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions, bridging the gap between static benchmarks and real-world VLN deployment.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACE (Adaptive path Correction with Exponents) fixes Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion models, enabling reliable composition of heterogeneous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion models fails when composing heterogeneous models (different noise schedules/datasets) due to Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable despite valid endpoints.

Method: 1) Derive path existence criterion predicting collapse from noise schedules and exponents; 2) Introduce ACE (Adaptive path Correction with Exponents) that extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents, guaranteeing valid probability paths.

Result: ACE eliminates collapse on synthetic 2D benchmark and flexible-pose scaffold decoration tasks, enabling high-guidance compositional generation with improved distributional and docking metrics over baselines.

Conclusion: ACE transforms ratio-of-densities steering from unstable heuristic to reliable tool for controllable generation with heterogeneous expert models.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhili He,Huanghuang Liang,Yili Gong,Jiawei Jiang,Chuang Hu,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMISVFU enables efficient client-level unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning by collapsing encoder outputs to random anchors and optimizing retention/forgetting losses with orthogonal gradient alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated unlearning methods focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) but are ineffective for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) where data is partitioned by features. GDPR's right to be forgotten requires effective unlearning solutions for VFL systems.

Method: Proposes REMISVFU: a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework. When deletion requested, forgetting party collapses encoder output to random anchor on unit sphere. Server jointly optimizes retention loss (maintaining utility) and forgetting loss (removing influence) using orthogonal projection to align gradients and prevent destructive interference.

Result: Evaluations show REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to natural class-prior level while sacrificing only ~2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: REMISVFU provides an effective solution for client-level unlearning in VFL systems, addressing GDPR compliance needs while maintaining model utility for remaining parties.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmerFlow is an LLM-powered framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items in recommendation systems by enriching raw features through LLM reasoning, aligning with existing model embeddings, and refining through meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods oversimplify emerging items by assuming they have few or no historical interactions, failing to preserve their uniqueness while leveraging shared patterns with established items.

Method: EmerFlow uses LLM reasoning to enrich raw features of emerging items, aligns these representations with existing recommendation model embedding space, and incorporates new interactions through meta-learning to refine embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse domains (movies and pharmaceuticals) show EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods in learning expressive embeddings for emerging items from limited interactions.

Conclusion: EmerFlow successfully addresses the challenge of recommending emerging items by generating distinctive embeddings that preserve uniqueness while leveraging shared patterns, demonstrating superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents for long-horizon task automation face critical bottlenecks due to reliance on ever-expanding interaction history, which incurs substantial context overhead.

Conclusion: The program-guided approach provides a principled mechanism for agent context management that effectively reduces context overhead while preserving semantic information, enabling robust performance in long-horizon mobile GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SaEI introduces selective-adversarial entropy intervention to enhance VLM reasoning by using entropy of sampled responses to create adversarial visual inputs, improving policy exploration during RL sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based finetuning methods for VLMs only intervene in entropy during policy optimization, ignoring entropy intervention during RL sampling which could improve response diversity and boost GRPO performance.

Method: Proposes SaEI with two components: 1) Entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) formulates entropy of sampled responses as adversarial objective to attack visual inputs, and 2) Token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) maximizes adversarial attack effectiveness without distorting factual knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show the method greatly improves policy exploration via entropy intervention, boosting reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

Conclusion: SaEI effectively enhances policy entropy through selective-adversarial intervention during RL sampling, leading to improved reasoning performance in vision-language models.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new graph representation method converts adjacency matrices into instruction strings for deep learning model compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations are not compatible with powerful deep learning language models designed for text processing, creating a gap between graph analysis and modern AI capabilities.

Method: Transform adjacency matrices into strings of simple instructions that build the matrix step by step, creating a reversible and compact representation that preserves local structural patterns.

Result: The method produces a reversible transformation (graph ↔ string), maintains graph structure, and preliminary computational experiments show favorable results.

Conclusion: This instruction-based graph representation could enhance graph processing by deep learning models by making graphs amenable to text-based AI approaches.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFAP is a new method for targeted data protection in diffusion models that controls the entire training trajectory rather than just matching snapshots, enabling verifiable redirection to user-specified concepts while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion model fine-tuning for personalization raises privacy concerns, but existing protection methods only degrade image quality passively. Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers active redirection, but existing TDP methods have poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that don't account for complete learning dynamics.

Method: TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations) controls the entire training trajectory using trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation. Unlike snapshot-based methods, it enforces persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning by aligning the complete learning process.

Result: TAFAP achieves the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. It significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: TAFAP enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs, representing a significant advancement in targeted data protection for privacy-preserving AI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

TL;DR: Researchers investigate how adversarial PDF manipulation can fool AI peer review systems to flip "Reject" decisions to "Accept," developing a new metric (WAVS) and showing successful attacks across 13 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly used in peer review (both by individual reviewers and institutional systems), there's a critical need to understand their vulnerability to adversarial attacks that could manipulate acceptance decisions.

Method: Created dataset of 200 scientific papers, adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies, developed WAVS metric, and evaluated attacks across 13 language models including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.

Result: Obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulated scores and achieved alarming decision flip rates, even in large-scale models, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities in AI-powered peer review systems.

Conclusion: AI peer review systems are vulnerable to adversarial PDF manipulation attacks that can flip rejection decisions to acceptance, highlighting serious security concerns as LLMs become more integrated into scientific evaluation processes.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

Motivation: PCG requires precise configuration of opaque technical parameters, and off-the-shelf LLMs often fail to bridge the semantic gap between natural language instructions and strict parameter specifications.

Method: Training-free architecture with Actor and Critic LLM agents that work iteratively: Actor reasons over tool parameters, Critic refines configurations to align with human design preferences.

Result: Outperforms single-agent baselines, produces diverse and structurally valid 3D environments from natural language descriptions, establishes new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools by shifting burden from model training to architectural reasoning, offering scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

### [166] [Achieving Olympia-Level Geometry Large Language Model Agent via Complexity Boosting Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10534)
*Haiteng Zhao,Junhao Shen,Yiming Zhang,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Tianyou Ma,Fan Zheng,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InternGeometry is an LLM agent that solves IMO-level geometry problems using iterative proposition generation, symbolic verification, and reflection, achieving gold medalist performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI geometry solving is dominated by expert models like AlphaGeometry 2 that require massive data synthesis and search, while LLM agents struggle with heuristic limitations for auxiliary constructions in geometry problems.

Method: Iterative proposition generation with symbolic engine verification and reflection, dynamic memory for 200+ interactions per problem, and Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) that gradually increases problem complexity during training.

Result: Solves 44/50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples (0.004% of AlphaGeometry 2's data), and discovers novel auxiliary constructions not in human solutions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM agents can achieve expert-level geometry performance with minimal data through iterative reasoning and symbolic verification, offering a promising alternative to data-intensive expert models.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

*Xin Guan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NormCode is a semiformal language for constructing AI workflows that prevents context pollution by enforcing data isolation between steps, enabling precise cost/reliability tracing and auditable AI workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multistep LLM workflows suffer from context pollution where information accumulation across steps causes hallucinations, confusion of intermediate outputs, and loss of task constraints, creating reliability issues in high-stakes domains.

Method: NormCode provides a semiformal language with strict separation between semantic operations (LLM-driven reasoning) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring). It exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification.

Result: Validated through two demonstrations: (1) base X addition algorithm achieving 100% accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self-hosted execution of NormCode's own five-phase compiler pipeline. The orchestrator provides dependency-driven scheduling, SQLite checkpointing, and loop management.

Conclusion: NormCode makes AI workflows auditable by design, addressing critical transparency needs in high-stakes domains like legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis by eliminating cross-step contamination through structured decomposition.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

*Minghao LI,Ruihang Wang,Rui Tan,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phythesis combines LLMs with physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate energy-efficient data center design, achieving 57.3% higher generation success and 11.5% better power efficiency than vanilla LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data center design methods using human expertise and simulation tools don't scale with increasing system complexity. Existing AI approaches for indoor layouts ignore physics, making them unsuitable for DC design which requires quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints.

Method: Phythesis uses iterative bi-level optimization: (1) LLM-driven level generates 3D layouts and self-criticizes to refine scene topology, (2) physics-informed level identifies optimal asset parameters and selects best asset combinations for simulation-ready scene synthesis.

Result: Experiments on three generation scales show Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement compared to vanilla LLM-based solutions.

Conclusion: Phythesis successfully bridges the gap between generative AI and physics-aware design by synergizing LLMs with evolutionary optimization, enabling automated, simulation-ready, energy-efficient data center design that respects physical constraints.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

*Liang Peng,Haopeng Liu,Yixuan Ye,Cheng Liu,Wenjun Shen,Si Wu,Hau-San Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scRCL is a refinement contrastive learning framework for unsupervised cell type identification that incorporates cell-gene interactions to improve clustering of closely related cell types in single-cell omics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods focus only on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to distinguish closely related cell types in single-cell omics studies.

Method: Proposes scRCL with two contrastive distribution alignment components for cellular structure, plus a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to capture cell-gene associations and enhance embeddings.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets, with recovered populations showing coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: Incorporating cell-gene interactions through contrastive learning and refinement modules improves unsupervised cell type identification and reveals biologically meaningful relationships.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

*Tong Zhang,Carlos Hinojosa,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that mitigates memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, using frequency-based noise initialization, optimal timestep identification, and feature injection from reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt.

Method: CAPTAIN uses frequency-based noise initialization to reduce replication of memorized patterns early in denoising, identifies optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection, localizes memorized regions, and injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions.

Result: CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt and preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN provides an effective training-free framework for mitigating memorization in diffusion models without compromising prompt fidelity, addressing privacy and copyright concerns in deployed systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

*Muhua Huang,Qinlin Zhao,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Value diversity in LLM-based multi-agent systems enhances collective intelligence, stability, and creativity, but extreme heterogeneity causes diminishing returns and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diversity of values shapes collective behavior in AI communities, bridging AI capabilities with sociological studies of institutional emergence.

Method: Used naturalistic value elicitation based on Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values to construct multi-agent simulations with varying agent numbers, enabling open-ended interactions and constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and increases creative principles developed autonomously by agents, but shows diminishing returns with extreme heterogeneity causing instability.

Conclusion: Value diversity represents a new axis for future AI capability development, connecting AI abilities with sociological insights into institutional emergence.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

### [172] [AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10671)
*Oscar Robben,Saeed Khalilian,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hardware-aware NAS framework designs optimized early-exit networks with adaptive exit branches and threshold tuning, achieving higher accuracy with same/lower computational cost than SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks reduce energy/latency but designing them is challenging; existing NAS approaches don't fully optimize exit branch depth/layer types, which significantly impact efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.

Method: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search that optimizes exit branch positions, number, depth, and layer types, combined with adaptive threshold tuning for early-exit decisions.

Result: On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, the framework designs networks achieving higher accuracy with same or lower average MACs compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Comprehensive optimization of exit branch architecture (depth, layer types) alongside adaptive thresholds enables more efficient and accurate early-exit networks than previous NAS methods.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

### [173] [Challenges of Evaluating LLM Safety for User Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10687)
*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM safety evaluations need context-aware approaches for personal advice domains like finance/health, as universal risk frameworks fail to capture individual vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks, but millions use LLMs for personal advice where harms are context-dependent. User-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped despite frameworks recognizing individual risk assessment needs.

Method: Evaluated GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on finance/health advice across varying vulnerability profiles. Conducted two studies: 1) compared context-blind vs context-aware evaluator safety ratings, 2) tested if realistic user context disclosure in prompts improves safety assessment.

Result: Context-blind evaluators rated identical responses significantly safer than context-aware evaluators (5/7 vs 3/7 for high-vulnerability users). Realistic user context disclosure in prompts showed no significant improvement in safety assessment. Vulnerable populations remain at risk despite context disclosure.

Conclusion: Effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, not just universal risks. Realistic context disclosure alone is insufficient, especially for vulnerable populations. Need distinct approaches from existing universal-risk frameworks.

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

TL;DR: RL optimization with clinical rewards boosts CXR VLM performance beyond SFT alone, but explicit thinking doesn't help; RadVLM achieves SOTA on report generation and visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs rely on supervised fine-tuning without evaluating answer quality, while RL with task-specific feedback has shown success in other domains. The study investigates whether RL and explicit reasoning ("thinking") can improve CXR interpretation.

Method: Built RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL with large-scale SFT on CXR data, added cold-start SFT for basic thinking ability, then applied Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded rewards for report generation and visual grounding. Conducted matched RL experiments on domain-specific and general-domain variants with/without thinking.

Result: RL provides additional gains beyond strong SFT on both report generation and grounding tasks, but explicit thinking does not further improve results. RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL is a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, enabling improved CXR interpretation without needing explicit intermediate reasoning steps.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

*Zouying Cao,Jiaji Deng,Li Yu,Weikang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe framework enables LLM agents to actively distill, adapt, and refine procedural memories for lifelong learning, outperforming larger memoryless models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks for LLM agents suffer from "passive accumulation" where memory is treated as a static archive rather than dynamically integrated with reasoning, limiting agent evolution.

Method: ReMe introduces three mechanisms: 1) multi-faceted distillation to extract fine-grained experiences (success patterns, failure triggers, comparative insights), 2) context-adaptive reuse with scenario-aware indexing, and 3) utility-based refinement to autonomously add valid memories and prune outdated ones.

Result: ReMe establishes new SOTA on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld benchmarks, with Qwen3-8B+ReMe outperforming larger Qwen3-14B without memory, demonstrating memory-scaling effect and computation-efficient lifelong learning.

Conclusion: Self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning in LLM agents, bridging the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning through active memory lifecycle management.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a domain-specific AI model for OCT-guided PCI, outperformed both general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in procedural decision-making for coronary interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intravascular imaging like OCT improves PCI outcomes but interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose AI lacks domain-specific reliability, creating a need for specialized AI systems to standardize OCT interpretation.

Method: Single-center analysis of 96 OCT-guided PCI patients comparing procedural decisions from CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians against expert-derived records using 10 pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher agreement scores than both ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for pre-PCI planning (median 5 vs 3 and 4) and post-PCI assessment (median 5 vs 4 and 5). Specifically outperformed junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs 72.2%) and length selection (80.6% vs 52.8%).

Conclusion: CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system provides superior, standardized, and reliable OCT interpretation for PCI planning and assessment, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided interventions.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

### [177] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG improves multi-hop RAG by replacing rather than expanding context to avoid dilution, using entity-anchored extraction and targeted queries to swap distractors for relevant evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on multi-hop queries when initial retrieval misses bridge facts, and corrective approaches that add more context cause context dilution where distractors crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG uses a "replace, don't expand" strategy with a Search→Extract→Assess→Loop cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to identify missing entities/relations, triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to swap distractors for gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3): +3-13 pp improvement in answer correctness and +12-18 pp in evidence precision over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5): +8.0 pp accuracy improvement over Adaptive-k, maintaining 96% evidence precision vs 22% for CRAG. All gains statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's fixed-k replacement strategy provides predictable cost while optimizing top-k slots for precision rather than breadth, effectively addressing context dilution in multi-hop RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD algorithms for HAR are only tested in limited scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on their effectiveness across different distribution shifts.

Method: Proposed HAROOD benchmark with 4 OOD scenarios (cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, cross-time), 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures, and two model selection protocols.

Result: Extensive experiments show no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement in OOD-based HAR research.

Conclusion: HAROOD provides a modular, extensible benchmark to facilitate research in OOD-based HAR, with findings that current methods have significant room for improvement across different distribution shift scenarios.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

TL;DR: Agile Deliberation: A human-in-the-loop framework that helps users refine vague visual concepts through iterative deliberation with borderline cases, achieving better classification performance than automated or manual approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop systems assume users have clear, stable concept understanding, but in reality (especially in content moderation), users often start with vague ideas that need iterative refinement through "concept deliberation."

Method: Agile Deliberation framework with two stages: (1) concept scoping - decomposing initial concept into structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration - surfacing semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align classifier with evolving user intent.

Result: Achieved 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, with participants reporting clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort (based on 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long).

Conclusion: Agile Deliberation effectively supports evolving and subjective concepts through structured deliberation, outperforming both automated and manual approaches while reducing cognitive load and improving concept clarity.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

### [180] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively rank scientific proposals with strong correlation to human rankings at much lower cost, while enabling advanced analyses like similarity assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human proposal review suffers from bias, inconsistency, and weak inter-proposal correlations. Pairwise preference ranking is theoretically better but impractical due to quadratic workload for humans.

Method: Use LLMs for pairwise preference-based ranking of proposals, leveraging well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at ORNL's Spallation Neutron Source.

Result: LLM rankings correlate strongly with human rankings (Spearman ρ≈0.2-0.8, improving to ≥0.5 after outlier removal). LLMs perform no worse than humans at identifying high-publication-potential proposals while costing 100x less.

Conclusion: LLMs offer scalable, consistent, and cost-effective proposal selection, enabling advanced analyses like quantitative similarity assessment that are challenging for human reviewers.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

### [181] [Multi-Granular Node Pruning for Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10903)
*Muhammad Umair Haider,Hammad Rizwan,Hassan Sajjad,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Node-level circuit discovery framework for LLMs that uses learnable masks with granularity-specific sparsity penalties to identify minimal subnetworks at multiple levels (blocks to neurons) in a single fine-tuning run.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units (attention heads/MLP blocks), overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. Need for scalable, granular approach.

Method: Propose node-level pruning framework with learnable masks across multiple granularity levels (blocks to neurons) within unified optimization objective. Use granularity-specific sparsity penalties to guide pruning, enabling comprehensive compression in single fine-tuning run.

Result: Identifies circuits with fewer nodes than prior methods; shows many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant while maintaining task performance. Has 5-10x lower memory footprint by not requiring intermediate activations in memory.

Conclusion: The proposed node-level circuit discovery framework addresses scalability and granularity limitations of existing methods, enabling efficient identification of minimal subnetworks at multiple levels while significantly reducing computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Establishes correspondence between POMDP agents and quantum process functions, showing dual interpretations between physics and AI perspectives, extended to multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge concepts between decision-making agents in AI (POMDPs) and quantum information theory (process functions), revealing fundamental connections between these fields and enabling new perspectives on agent-environment interactions.

Method: Identifies precise correspondence where agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with POMDP environment via link product. Uses mathematical framework to show dual interpretations between physics and AI views.

Result: Established that POMDP agents correspond to one-input process functions, with dual interpretation: in physics view, process function acts as environment; in AI view, it encodes agent. Extended to multi-agent systems via observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as domains for multi-input process functions.

Conclusion: Reveals deep connection between AI decision-making and quantum information theory, providing new mathematical framework for understanding agent-environment interactions and enabling cross-disciplinary insights between AI and physics.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.
