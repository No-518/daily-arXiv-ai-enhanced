### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' ability to read measurement instruments, showing that even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with precise measurement reading due to difficulties in indicator localization and spatial grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models find it surprisingly challenging to read measurement instruments despite this being effortless for humans, highlighting a gap in fine-grained spatial perception capabilities.

Method: Created MeasureBench with real-world and synthesized measurement images, along with an extensible pipeline for procedural gauge generation with controllable visual elements like pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter.

Result: Evaluation shows frontier VLMs struggle with measurement reading, particularly with indicator localization - models can read digits but misidentify pointer positions, leading to significant numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fundamental limitations in fine-grained spatial grounding, and the benchmark aims to help advance visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception in future models.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework for multi-institutional QCT that addresses domain shift using adversarial and statistical alignment to enable scanner-agnostic proximal femur segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks trained on one QCT dataset often fail on others due to domain shift from varying scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics, making automated segmentation unreliable across institutions.

Method: Developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework using 3D TransUNet backbone with two alignment strategies: adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

Result: Trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture research cohorts (1,024 QCT images from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota) for proximal femur segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual alignment mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail for reproducible multi-center osteoporosis research.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing primitive count by up to 30% while improving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ADC uses only positional gradient magnitudes for primitive splitting, which may lead to redundant splitting and suboptimal alignment with local structures.

Method: Incorporates directional consistency of gradients through angular coherence to better capture local structural complexities, and uses DC to define optimal split positions for sub-primitives.

Result: Reduces number of primitives by up to 30% compared to existing ADC methods while significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: DC4GS provides more efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction by leveraging directional consistency for adaptive density control in Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

### [4] [Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26923)
*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SACL is a dynamic curriculum learning method that adapts to data scale, improving lung nodule detection performance under limited data conditions without changing model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with limited annotated data in clinical settings, and traditional static curriculum learning fails in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Proposed Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) with three mechanisms: adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization, evaluated on LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11.

Result: SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum on full dataset, but shows significant improvements of 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL enables robust training across varying data scales without architectural modifications, providing a practical solution for healthcare institutions with limited annotation resources.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNAPSE-Net is a unified adaptive framework for brain lesion segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple pathologies by integrating multi-stream CNNs, Swin Transformer, cross-modal attention fusion, and hierarchical gated decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for brain lesion segmentation are specialized point solutions lacking generalization and showing high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability.

Method: Hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF), hierarchical gated decoder, trained with pathology-specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling.

Result: Achieved DSC 0.831 (HD95 3.03) on WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy on ISLES 2022 (HD95 9.69), and highest DSC 0.8651 for tumor core on BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: The unified adaptive framework provides state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, offering a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAT model for live video comment generation that prioritizes semantically relevant frames using CLIP's multimodal knowledge and weighted frame aggregation, with a new English Twitch dataset covering 11 categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook prioritizing video frames relevant to viewer interactions, which is crucial for generating contextually appropriate comments in live streaming platforms.

Method: Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) that uses CLIP for visual-text knowledge, assigns weights to frames based on semantic relevance to conversations, employs weighted frame sum, and uses cross-attention comment decoder.

Result: Created large-scale English Twitch dataset with 11 categories, 438 hours, and 3.2M comments. SFAT outperforms existing methods in generating contextually appropriate comments from live video and dialogue.

Conclusion: The SFAT model effectively addresses the frame prioritization problem in live video comment generation and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework for incremental human-object interaction detection to address challenges in dynamic open-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional closed-world HOI detection models struggle with continuously evolving human-object interactions in open-world environments. The paper aims to develop agents that can progressively acquire knowledge like humans do.

Method: Proposes IRD framework that decouples learning of objects and relations, introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations sharing the same relation.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

Conclusion: The proposed IRD framework effectively addresses incremental HOI detection challenges including catastrophic forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOI detection in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned version of SAM specifically designed for autonomous driving semantic segmentation, featuring a dual-encoder architecture and deformable decoder that improves segmentation accuracy and generalization in road scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes in autonomous driving by enhancing the Segment Anything Model with specialized architecture and optimization techniques for better semantic segmentation performance.

Method: Extends SAM with dual-encoder (combining SAM's ViT-H for global context with ResNet-50 for local detail), deformable fusion module for feature alignment, and progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention. Training uses hybrid loss combining Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses.

Result: Achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU respectively. Shows strong cross-domain generalization (0.87 retention score), faster convergence (30-40 epochs), and data efficiency (0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception with improved accuracy, generalization, and data efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [11] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT is a hierarchical neural field representation that learns general 3D shape hierarchies in an unsupervised manner using a hierarchical transformer with compressed codebook, enabling automatic identification of common substructures across diverse shape categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible hierarchical representation for 3D shapes that can learn general hierarchies across different categories without fixed structural constraints, unlike previous methods that use fixed hierarchical structures like binary trees.

Method: Uses a hierarchical transformer (HiT) where each level learns parent-child relationships using a compressed codebook, allowing automatic identification of common substructures. The method imposes no fixed hierarchical structure constraints except limiting total nodes per tree level.

Result: The model captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes when trained with reconstruction loss. Successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity across all 55 ShapeNet categories in unsupervised segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: HiT provides a flexible approach for learning general hierarchical structures in 3D shapes across multiple categories, outperforming prior methods by inferring hierarchies directly from data without structural constraints.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

### [12] [ZEBRA: Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Subject Generalization for Universal Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27128)
*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA is a zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that reconstructs images from fMRI data without subject-specific training, using adversarial learning to disentangle subject-related and semantic-related components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image reconstruction methods require subject-specific models or fine-tuning, which limits scalability and real-world applicability. There's a need for a universal approach that can generalize to unseen subjects.

Method: ZEBRA uses adversarial training to decompose fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, explicitly disentangling them to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations for zero-shot generalization.

Result: ZEBRA significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics, demonstrating effective generalization to unseen subjects without additional fMRI data or retraining.

Conclusion: ZEBRA represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding, enabling fMRI-to-image reconstruction without subject-specific adaptation and advancing the bridge between neuroscience and computer vision.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

### [13] [WildfireX-SLAM: A Large-scale Low-altitude RGB-D Dataset for Wildfire SLAM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27133)
*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces WildfireX-SLAM, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for 3D Gaussian splatting-based SLAM in large-scale forest environments, addressing the lack of real-world data for wildfire emergency response and forest management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in 3DGS-based SLAM research for large-scale forest scenes due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. Real-world data collection is costly and technically challenging, especially for wildfire scenarios.

Method: Developed a pipeline using Unreal Engine 5 to collect synthetic aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities from UAVs. The pipeline allows flexible control over environmental factors like lighting, weather, and wildfire conditions.

Result: Created WildfireX-SLAM dataset containing 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images from a 16 km² forest map. Conducted comprehensive benchmarking that reveals unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in forest environments.

Conclusion: The dataset enables research in forest mapping and wildfire emergency response, highlighting areas for future improvement in 3DGS-based SLAM methods for complex outdoor environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models require large-scale training data and computational resources, or suffer from high latency and heavy structures, limiting accessibility.

Method: Uses token reduction strategy with compressive visual tokenizer, multi-path compression module, Position Reinforcement for spatial coherence, Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA) to reduce computation, and AdaLN-affine for efficient modulation.

Result: Achieves 0.66 on GenEval for 512px generation, easily reaching 0.72 with post-training techniques like GRPO, while being highly efficient with minimal training requirements.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT serves as a strong, practical baseline that contributes to democratizing generative AI by making high-quality image synthesis more accessible with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [15] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) to improve cross-view object geo-localization by enabling better information transfer between views and suppressing edge noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively transfer information between views and don't refine spatial relationship feature maps, causing models to focus on irrelevant edge noise that affects localization performance.

Method: Introduces CVCAM for multiple iterations of cross-view interaction to exchange contextual information, and MHSAM using multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract enhanced spatial features. Also creates a new G2D dataset for Ground-to-Drone localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CVOGL and G2D datasets show the method achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed CVCAM and MHSAM modules effectively address cross-view information transfer limitations and edge noise issues, demonstrating superior performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

*Jiacheng Hong,Kunzhen Wu,Mingrui Yu,Yichao Gu,Shengze Xue,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical generative framework for 3D scene generation that enables multi-step associative semantic spatial composition, allowing users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic objects while maintaining spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene generation methods use single-step processes that struggle to balance scene complexity with minimal user input, unlike the human cognitive process that progresses from global to local and completes scenes through semantic association.

Method: Proposes HiGS framework with Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) that dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies, maintaining one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and objects, and supporting recursive layout optimization.

Result: Experiments show HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering controllable and extensible 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: HiGS provides an efficient paradigm for 3D scene generation that mimics human cognitive processes, enabling fine-grained control over regions of interest while automatically completing peripheral areas.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net is a hierarchical fusion framework that combines CNN for local features and Mamba for global context to improve remote sensing image classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with balanced performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image classification is challenging due to complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics. Existing methods have limitations: CNNs are good at local textures but Transformers are computationally expensive for global context modeling.

Method: Proposes AFM-Net with two pathways: CNN branch for hierarchical visual priors and Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. Uses Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism to progressively aggregate multi-scale features and Mixture-of-Experts classifier for fine-grained scene recognition.

Result: Achieves 93.72% accuracy on AID, 95.54% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.92% on UC Merced datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net effectively integrates local and global representations through hierarchical fusion, demonstrating superior performance in remote sensing scene classification while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

TL;DR: This study explores using existing deep learning models to approximate Banff lesion scores for renal transplant biopsies through a modular, rule-based framework, but reveals significant limitations in replicating expert-level grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Banff Classification is the global standard for renal transplant biopsy evaluation but faces challenges due to its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability, making computational replication difficult.

Method: Decompose Banff indicators into structural and inflammatory components, use existing segmentation and detection tools to compute them, and map model outputs to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines.

Result: Partial successes but critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations undermine interpretability.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines have limitations in replicating computational expert-level grading, emphasizing the need for modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standards to guide future model development.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

### [19] [Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164)
*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline combining VLMs, LLMs, and object detection to improve high-resolution image captioning by identifying missing objects and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with high-resolution images due to low-resolution pre-training, losing visual details and omitting important objects when downscaling.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: VLM generates initial caption, LLM identifies key objects and predicts co-occurring objects, object detection verifies predictions, and region-specific captioning incorporates newly detected objects.

Result: Enhanced captions are more detailed and reliable while effectively minimizing hallucinations, as demonstrated on curated high-resolution image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses VLM limitations for high-resolution images by enriching caption detail and reducing hallucinations through object detection integration.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

TL;DR: M^3Detection is a multi-frame 3D object detection framework that fuses camera and 4D imaging radar data through multi-level feature fusion and spatiotemporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-frame camera-radar fusion methods that provide incomplete scene information due to image degradation and radar sparsity, and to address computational challenges in multi-frame fusion.

Method: Uses intermediate features from baseline detector and tracker-generated reference trajectories for efficiency. Implements global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar, local-level inter-grid feature aggregation along trajectories, and trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed M^3Detection framework successfully addresses multi-frame fusion challenges and provides robust 3D object detection by leveraging complementary camera and 4D radar modalities with efficient spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Augmenting Vision-Language-Action models with world modeling shows promise but faces challenges in jointly predicting next-state observations and action sequences due to inherent modality differences between vision and action.

Method: Proposes DUal-STream diffusion (DUST) with multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that maintains separate modality streams while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. Uses independent noise perturbations for each modality and decoupled flow-matching loss to learn joint distribution bidirectionally without unified latent space. Includes joint sampling with test-time scaling where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously.

Result: Achieves up to 6% gains over baselines on simulated benchmarks (RoboCasa, GR-1), with test-time scaling providing additional 2-5% boost. On real-world Franka Research 3 tasks, improves success rates by 13%. Pre-training on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on RoboCasa.

Conclusion: DUST effectively addresses modality conflict in world-model augmented VLAs, demonstrating improved performance across simulation and real-world tasks, and showing strong potential for large-scale VLA pretraining through effective knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation, especially for human-involved content like dancing, is challenging due to high quality requirements, video continuity needs, and the complexity of human motions. Existing methods struggle with capturing detailed appearance and motion guidance effectively.

Method: Built on stable video diffusion model, DANCER introduces two key modules: Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus on reference image details, and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to extend motion guidance from extra domains. Also created TikTok-3K dataset for enhanced training.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing improved dance synthesis quality and realism.

Conclusion: DANCER effectively addresses the challenges of human dance video generation through specialized modules for appearance enhancement and pose rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic single-person dance synthesis.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache is a hierarchical caching mechanism for diffusion models that accelerates inference by separating denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages, using dual thresholds and pooled feature summarization for efficient similarity estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face practical deployment challenges due to high computational costs of iterative denoising. Existing caching methods create a trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and computational overhead.

Method: H2-Cache employs a hierarchical dual-stage caching mechanism based on the insight that denoising can be separated into structure-defining and detail-refining stages. It uses dual thresholds for selective caching and introduces pooled feature summarization (PFS) for lightweight similarity estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Flux architecture show H2-Cache achieves up to 5.08x acceleration while maintaining nearly identical image quality to baseline, outperforming existing caching methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: H2-Cache provides a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma in diffusion models, significantly lowering barriers for real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell is a video identification attack that uses subtitle silhouette analysis to infer both online and offline videos by combining spatial and temporal features, achieving effective identification from distances up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification attacks pose serious privacy threats by revealing users' viewing habits, which can expose sensitive personal information like hobbies, beliefs, and health status, potentially leading to profiling, discrimination, or blackmail.

Method: The method analyzes subtitle silhouettes displayed on screens, combining spatial content (subtitle shape) and temporal information (timing between subtitles) to create spatiotemporal features. It correlates recorded subtitle silhouettes with video subtitle files.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on smartphones demonstrate high efficacy in inferring video titles and clips under various settings, including identification from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell represents a novel and effective video identification technique that poses significant privacy risks by enabling video inference through subtitle silhouette analysis, working for both online and offline content.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

TL;DR: DPHR is a dual-level reweighting strategy for cross-view geo-localization that addresses hard negatives through sample-level difficulty assessment and batch-level progressive weighting to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery faces challenges from severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives. Existing static weighting methods are sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, causing noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) with: 1) Sample-level Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module that evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives, 2) Batch-level Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism that uses training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients early and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and robustness, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DPHR provides an effective solution for handling hard negatives in cross-view geo-localization through progressive hardness-aware reweighting that stabilizes training and enhances performance.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [26] [Sparse Model Inversion: Efficient Inversion of Vision Transformers for Data-Free Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27186)
*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse model inversion strategy to accelerate existing dense inversion methods by selectively inverting semantic foregrounds while avoiding noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations, achieving up to 3.79× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense model inversion methods are inefficient for high-resolution images from large-scale Vision Transformers due to redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and unintended inversion of spurious correlations (hallucination).

Method: A plug-and-play sparse model inversion strategy that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while stopping inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations, without modifying original loss functions.

Result: Achieves significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79× faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse model inversion approach effectively addresses inefficiency issues in existing dense inversion methods and enables faster model inversion with maintained performance.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge

*Caixin Kang,Yifei Huang,Liangyang Ouyang,Mingfang Zhang,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIVA, a new multimodal deception detection task using Werewolf game data, and finds that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle significantly at distinguishing truth from deception in dynamic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more integrated into human lives, robust social intelligence including deception detection is crucial. Current automatic deception detection in multi-party conversations remains challenging, and MLLMs' capabilities in this domain are unquantified.

Method: Created a new task called Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA) and developed a novel multimodal dataset from the social deduction game Werewolf, providing synchronized video, text, and verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarking revealed a significant performance gap - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to reliably distinguish truth from falsehood. Models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to build more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems that can effectively detect deception in multimodal social interactions.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

*Jiaxin Zhang,Zehong Zhu,Junye Deng,Yunqin Li,and Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to analyze village spatial morphology, addressing limitations in existing single-disciplinary approaches and achieving significant performance improvements in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Villages are important for studying human-land relationships, but urbanization is causing spatial characteristics to disappear and landscapes to homogenize. Existing research has limitations including single-disciplinary perspectives, reliance on qualitative methods, lack of digital infrastructure, and insufficient data.

Method: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model with input nodes and communication nodes, static input edges and dynamic communication edges. It combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a two-stage feature update mechanism. The model includes a relational pooling mechanism and implements joint training across 17 village spatial morphology subtypes.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, with a 6% gain for parcel tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HGNN model provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic, effectively addressing the limitations of current research methods in village spatial morphology analysis.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual self-supervised learning framework for chest CT images that learns diverse features across multiple window settings while ensuring data privacy through latent replay and feature distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical image diagnosis including scarcity of large annotated datasets, domain shifts from different CT window settings, and privacy constraints that prevent data reuse.

Method: Uses continual pretraining on unlabeled images with latent replay-based mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and incorporates feature distillation with Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE).

Result: Validated on chest CT images across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shift issues in medical imaging while maintaining data privacy, providing a robust and generalizable solution for continual learning in healthcare environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

### [30] [SpecAware: A Spectral-Content Aware Foundation Model for Unifying Multi-Sensor Learning in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27219)
*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that uses sensor meta-attributes and hypernetwork-driven encoding to unify multi-sensor HSI learning, achieving superior performance across various downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI data heterogeneity and the lack of sensor meta-attribute guidance in existing foundation models limit transferability and multi-sensor training capabilities.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: 1) meta-content aware module fuses sensor attributes with image content, 2) HyperEmbedding module generates adaptive matrix factors for channel-wise encoding via sample-conditioned hypernetwork.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show SpecAware excels in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification, learning superior feature representations.

Conclusion: SpecAware successfully establishes a unified framework for joint pre-training across diverse sensors by adaptively processing variable spectral channels and interpreting spatial-spectral features.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering

TL;DR: MoRE is a dense 3D visual foundation model using Mixture-of-Experts architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple geometric tasks through dynamic feature routing, confidence-based depth refinement, and dense semantic feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in scaling 3D models due to geometric supervision complexity and 3D data diversity, while improving robustness under real-world conditions.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture for dynamic feature routing, incorporates confidence-based depth refinement module, integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations, and employs tailored loss functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: MoRE demonstrates that the proposed approach successfully addresses 3D model scaling challenges and delivers robust geometric estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised image retargeting method that uses mesh warping optimization guided by object appearance consistency and geometric constraints to eliminate distortion in important regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the persistent challenge of geometric distortion in semantically important regions during image retargeting, which remains an intractable problem in the field.

Method: Reformulates image retargeting as a learning-based mesh warping optimization using a CNN to predict mesh grid motions. Uses object-consistent loss, geometric-preserving loss, and boundary loss in a self-supervised paradigm without manual annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RetargetMe benchmark, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality. Processes 1024x683 images in 0.009s average inference time with real-time performance on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: Object-IR effectively eliminates geometric distortion in important regions through self-supervised mesh deformation, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing retargeting methods.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

TL;DR: FuseCPath is a framework that fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) for whole slide image analysis, achieving superior ensemble performance through multi-view clustering, cluster-level re-embedding, and collaborative distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models show substantial heterogeneity due to diverse training datasets and architectures, leading to performance variability in downstream tasks. There's a need to effectively leverage multiple FMs to improve computational pathology analysis.

Method: 1) Multi-view clustering to filter discriminative patches using multiple FMs' embeddings; 2) Cluster-level re-embedding strategy for fusing heterogeneous patch-level FMs; 3) Collaborative distillation strategy for fusing heterogeneous slide-level FMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets (lung cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on public datasets.

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively addresses the heterogeneity problem in pathological foundation models and achieves superior ensemble performance through its innovative fusion framework.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase training method combining spatial and frequency domain denoising using Discrete Wavelet Transform to defend against adversarial attacks on DNNs, significantly improving classification accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which limits their use in security-critical applications. The authors aim to develop a robust defense mechanism against these attacks.

Method: Two-phase training: 1) Train a denoising network that integrates spatial image features with frequency analysis using Discrete Wavelet Transform through a transformer layer, 2) Retrain the classifier using denoised images to enhance robustness.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets show the method significantly elevates classification accuracy, substantially outperforming existing denoising networks and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid spatial-frequency denoising approach effectively defends against adversarial attacks and enhances DNN robustness, making it suitable for security-critical applications.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause incorrect predictions with small input perturbations, making robust defense crucial for reliable deep learning deployment.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in model robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing valuable insights to the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using web-crawled descriptions and LLM-extracted keywords to improve zero-shot action recognition in VLMs, addressing ambiguity from multi-semantic words in action classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in zero-shot action recognition caused by multi-semantic words in action classes, which can lead to misunderstanding of intended action concepts.

Method: Use web-crawled descriptions with LLM-extracted keywords to provide better semantic context, plus a spatio-temporal interaction module to align description attributes with video content.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600 in zero-shot experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves zero-shot action recognition performance while reducing manual annotation effort, demonstrating adaptability across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG is a multi-modal RAG framework that shifts retrieval from document-level to region-level, using hybrid supervision to identify relevant visual patches and dynamic grouping for semantic regions, achieving SOTA performance with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods treat entire documents as retrieval units, introducing irrelevant visual content that dilutes focus on salient information and degrades performance through redundant contexts.

Method: Proposes region-level retrieval paradigm with hybrid supervision strategy from labeled and unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches, and dynamic pipeline for grouping salient patches into complete semantic regions during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks: improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02% in R@1 on average, increases question answering accuracy by 3.56% while using only 71.42% visual tokens compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: RegionRAG effectively addresses redundancy in multi-modal RAG by focusing on relevant visual regions, enabling generators to concentrate on concise visual content and improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T^3 is a test-time adaptive model merging framework for medical vision-language models that dynamically balances pretrained robustness and fine-tuned precision using Jensen-Shannon divergence, with a batch-wise extension T^3_B for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing model-merging techniques in medical imaging: pretrained models lack modality-specific characteristics while fine-tuned models fail under modality shift, and current methods designed for natural images don't work consistently across diverse medical modalities.

Method: Propose T^3 framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions, dynamically preserving local precision when models agree and deferring to generalist robustness under drift. Also introduce T^3_B for batch-wise computation to reduce inference costs.

Result: T^3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency. Validated through rigorous cross-evaluation protocol spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruption scenarios.

Conclusion: T^3 provides an effective backpropagation-free solution for adaptive medical vision-language model deployment, balancing robustness and precision dynamically, with practical efficiency through batch-wise computation.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

### [40] [HyperClick: Advancing Reliable GUI Grounding via Uncertainty Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27266)
*Shaojie Zhang,Pei Fu,Ruoceng Zhang,Jiahui Yang,Anan Du,Xiuwen Xi,Shaokang Wang,Ying Huang,Bin Qin,Zhenbo Luo,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperClick is a framework that improves GUI agent reliability by calibrating uncertainty through dual rewards and spatial confidence modeling, reducing overconfidence while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions that can cause task failures in dynamic GUI automation.

Method: Proposes HyperClick with dual reward mechanism: binary reward for correct actions plus truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling calibrated using Brier score, jointly optimizing grounding accuracy and confidence reliability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven challenge benchmarks while providing well-calibrated confidence, reducing overconfidence and supporting more reliable GUI automation.

Conclusion: HyperClick enables explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, making GUI agents more reliable by aligning confidence with actual accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

### [41] [FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280)
*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free keyframe selection method that treats video frames as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem, using confidence bounds to select query-relevant frames under strict token budgets for multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for long videos either uniformly subsample or use retrieval-style scoring, which can miss informative moments and require pre-filtering, limiting their effectiveness for hour-long videos.

Method: FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem using multi-armed bandits, treating temporal clips as arms and using empirical means with Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while exploring uncertain areas.

Result: On long-video QA benchmarks, FOCUS achieves substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames, with 11.9% gain on videos longer than 20 minutes in LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective, model-agnostic solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs by optimizing keyframe selection under strict token constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [42] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE introduces semantics-guided adversarial concept erasure for diffusion models, improving erasure performance by 26% while reducing training time by 90% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models use adversarial training but neglect the specificity of adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation and failure to properly fit target concept spaces.

Method: S-GRACE leverages semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, addressing the limitations of existing methods that neglect conceptual semantics.

Result: Experiments show S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance by 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90% compared to seven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: S-GRACE demonstrates that semantics-guided adversarial concept erasure effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by properly fitting concept spaces and achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGMamba is a frequency-aware gated state-space model that combines global dependency modeling with fine-detail enhancement for medical image super-resolution, achieving superior performance with compact parameter size (<0.75M).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image super-resolution is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing acquisition costs, but existing methods struggle to model both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details efficiently.

Method: Proposes FGMamba with two key components: Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) that integrates state-space modeling with dual-branch attention, and Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that captures high-frequency details via FFT-guided fusion across multiple resolutions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, Endoscopic) show FGMamba achieves superior PSNR/SSIM performance while maintaining compact parameter footprint (<0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware state-space modeling is effective for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement, providing a lightweight yet powerful solution for medical image super-resolution.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that uses multichannel preprocessing, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and contour refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting narrow and stenotic vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical for reducing mortality, but poor X-ray image quality can impede clinical diagnosis of stenotic coronary arteries.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Multichannel preprocessing combining CLAHE and improved Ben Graham method, 2) Segmentation network with UNet architecture using DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder to preserve vessel continuity, 3) Contour refinement module to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% on combined public datasets with both healthy and stenotic arteries, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust automated coronary artery segmentation approach that can support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

*Zijia An,Boyu Diao,Ruiqi Liu,Libo Huang,Chuanguang Yang,Fei Wang,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts using neural networks for incremental object detection, addressing co-occurrence issues and catastrophic forgetting through adaptive consolidation and constrained updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based approaches assume disjoint class sets, which is unsuitable for object detection where objects from previous tasks can co-occur in current images, causing confusion in prompt pools.

Method: Uses neural networks as parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks, with a parameterized prompts fusion strategy to constrain structure updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in incremental object detection.

Conclusion: P²IOD effectively addresses co-occurrence challenges in incremental object detection through parameterized prompts with adaptive consolidation and constrained updates, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGS is a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework that improves deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic surgery by addressing aliasing and artifacts, achieving superior performance on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for endoscopic scene reconstruction prioritize rendering speed but neglect critical issues like aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which degrade visualization quality.

Method: Proposed SAGS framework with attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine tissue movement details.

Result: Superior performance on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks across all metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with better visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses aliasing and artifact issues in deformable tissue reconstruction while maintaining high reconstruction efficiency, making it suitable for robot-assisted surgical applications.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ultra-low bitrate visual communication method that integrates image generation with deep image compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for ultra-low bitrate visual communication in challenging scenarios like deep space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where existing text-to-image models only provide semantic approximations that are insufficient for accurate vision analysis and human interactions.

Method: Seamlessly integrates image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models. Both semantic text description and coding latent are encoded and transmitted at very small bit rates.

Result: Experimental results show the method achieves the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables accurate visual scene reconstruction and maintains vision analysis performance at ultra-low bit rates, making it suitable for bandwidth-constrained applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer detection remains challenging due to limited availability of high-quality segmentation labels, making robust classification-based approaches crucial for early detection in large-scale screening applications.

Method: The authors developed their approach through an iterative process involving experimentation, evaluation, and refinement, focusing on classification-based methods rather than segmentation due to label limitations.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive overview of their developed approach but does not specify quantitative performance metrics in the abstract.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the importance of classification-based approaches for breast cancer detection and have publicly released their full implementation to advance the field.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited
availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust
classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast
cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening.
In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient synthesis of cinematic scenes for television and film production from small datasets, addressing the need for domain-specific visual style adaptation.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) LoRA modules in cross-attention layers for visual style learning using small clip datasets, 2) Generate stylistically consistent keyframes and expand them into 720p sequences with temporal coherence.

Result: Quantitative improvements in FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, with qualitative enhancements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability confirmed by expert user study.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables efficient domain transfer within hours on single GPU and provides measurable improvements over base models, with released code for reproducibility across cinematic domains.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex editing instructions and require computationally expensive joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models, which has high training costs.

Method: Constructs structured semantic representation of input images using foundation models, then uses iterative update mechanism to progressively refine this representation into fine-grained visual representations for flexible editing.

Result: Surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR on SmartEdit dataset, showing superior preservation of consistent regions. Also outperforms previous methods on the new CIEBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CIELR effectively handles complex image editing through LLM reasoning without expensive joint fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance and preservation capabilities.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

TL;DR: The paper audits fairness in breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing persistent age-related bias against younger patients and showing how data aggregation affects ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in deep learning for medical imaging is underexplored beyond classification, particularly in segmentation tasks where bias can lead to disparities in care quality and be amplified through iterative model development.

Method: The researchers audit the fairness of automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer dataset by evaluating segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source variables.

Result: The analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that persists even after controlling for confounding factors like data source, potentially linked to physiological factors. Data aggregation from multiple sources influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the necessity of investigating medical imaging data at a granular level to identify and address segmentation biases that could lead to healthcare disparities.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based MLLMs primarily focus on natural images and offer limited support for other visual modalities like videos and visual documents, creating a gap in multimodal embedding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval; second stage uses improved InfoNCE loss with hardness-weighted mechanism and false negative mitigation, plus learnable temperature parameter and model souping.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on MMEB benchmark, achieves best overall score, and outperforms all prior work on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully bridges the modality gap by providing a unified framework for diverse visual modalities and demonstrates superior performance through its enhanced training strategy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: FPS is a gradient-free parameter selection method that identifies optimal parameter subsets in a single forward pass, achieving comparable performance to SOTA methods while reducing memory usage 9× and accelerating selection 2×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods have limitations: addition-based methods cause inference latency and complexity, while selection-based methods require full backward passes with high memory usage like full fine-tuning.

Method: FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data in a single forward pass without gradients.

Result: On 24 visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly 9× and accelerating parameter selection by about 2×.

Conclusion: FPS offers a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models by eliminating gradient computation while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

### [54] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) by proposing methods to preserve semantic relationships in text queries and disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods treat all annotated text-video pairs as positives and others as negatives, ignoring semantic variation within videos and across different videos, causing embeddings of queries and video segments to collapse together for similar content and drive apart for semantically similar content from different videos.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning to preserve semantic relationships in text queries, and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that the framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address semantic collapse in both text and video embedding spaces, leading to significant improvements in partially relevant video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In

integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper

*Wu Wei,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Pengxiang Li,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs hierarchical tree-like features for both images and text, aligns them in hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, and uses an intermediate manifold for cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models extract hierarchical text features but represent images with single features, creating asymmetric and suboptimal modality alignment.

Method: Constructs semantic-aware visual features using cross-attention on intermediate Transformer layers guided by text, embeds feature trees in hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures, and aligns them using KL distance minimization on an intermediate manifold.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical feature alignment method effectively addresses modality asymmetry and improves vision-language model performance.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deepfake detection framework combining forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency descriptors) with deep learning (CNNs and ViTs) outperforms single-method approaches and shows strong robustness against compression, adversarial attacks, and unseen manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs and diffusion models create highly realistic synthetic media, raising concerns about misinformation and digital trust. Existing detection methods either use deep learning (poor generalization) or forensic analysis (limited against new techniques), creating a need for hybrid approaches.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from CNNs and vision transformers.

Result: Outperformed single-method baselines on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, DFDC) with F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77. Showed robustness under compression (F1=0.87 at QF=50), adversarial perturbations (AUC=0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1=0.79). Explainability analysis revealed 82% overlap between Grad-CAM/forensic heatmaps and ground-truth manipulated regions.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches provide balanced solutions combining deep learning adaptability with forensic interpretability, enabling resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

*Zhuoning Guo,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval consisting of a comprehensive benchmark (UVRB), a data synthesis workflow, and a novel training curriculum (Modality Pyramid) that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems are structurally misaligned due to narrow benchmarks that incentivize limited data and single-task training, suppressing universal capability. There's a need for diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization.

Method: 1) Created Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets to diagnose capability gaps; 2) Developed scalable synthesis workflow generating 1.55M high-quality pairs; 3) Designed Modality Pyramid curriculum to train General Video Embedder (GVE) by leveraging interconnections in diverse data.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. Analysis reveals popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval, addressing structural misalignment in current video retrieval paradigms.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised framework for blind image deconvolution that uses iterative reverse self-diffusion without requiring pre-training, achieving superior performance in recovering sharp images and accurate blur kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional blind deconvolution methods rely on handcrafted priors, while deep learning approaches need extensive pre-training on external datasets, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Formulates blind deconvolution as iterative reverse self-diffusion starting from pure noise, using two randomly-initialized neural networks optimized continuously with data consistency and L1-norm sparsity constraints, plus a noise scheduling mechanism for stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios, with remarkable robustness to blur kernel size variations.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides an effective zero-shot solution for blind image deconvolution that dynamically learns instance-specific priors without external training, offering strong performance and adaptability to real-world conditions.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL is a self-supervised RL method that automatically creates five spatial reasoning tasks from ordinary images to improve LVLMs' spatial understanding without costly supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving spatial understanding in LVLMs rely on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scalability.

Method: Automatically formulates five pretext tasks from RGB/RGB-D images: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction.

Result: Achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines on seven spatial understanding benchmarks in both image and video settings.

Conclusion: Simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sketch-to-layout approach that uses user sketches as intuitive constraints for graphic layout generation, outperforming existing constraint-based methods while providing a more user-friendly design experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation methods require complex constraint specifications that reduce usability. The authors aim to make layout generation more intuitive by using sketches as natural user constraints.

Method: A multimodal transformer-based solution that takes sketches and content assets as inputs to generate layouts. The authors also developed a novel method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale to avoid costly human annotation.

Result: The model was trained and evaluated on PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA datasets, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art constraint-based methods. The authors also released ~200k synthetically-generated sketches to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is a promising research direction that offers more intuitive design experience while achieving better performance than existing constraint-based approaches. The synthetic sketch generation method enables scalable training without costly human annotation.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework that generates editable vector graphics for scientific illustrations, addressing limitations of current raster image generation and code-based methods by providing element-level control and intuitive manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models have two major limitations: raster images lack semantic structure for element-level editing, while code-based methods are cumbersome and unintuitive. Neither approach meets the needs for efficient, intuitive scientific illustration creation with iterative modification.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three specialized modules (Manager, Designer, Toolbox) built on model context protocol to collaboratively produce vector graphics diagrams. It also introduces VisBench benchmark with seven-dimensional metrics to evaluate scientific illustrations across content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost.

Result: The framework enables true element-level control where any element can be added and modified later. Extensive ablation experiments verified the architecture's rationality and evaluation methods' reliability. Various vision-language models were evaluated with fair rankings and detailed capability comparisons.

Conclusion: VisPainter successfully bridges the gap between information density and post-editability in scientific illustrations by providing a modular, role-based design that allows explicit representation and manipulation of individual elements, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VessShape generates synthetic 2D datasets with tubular geometries to instill shape bias in segmentation models, enabling strong few-shot and zero-shot performance on real-world blood vessel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity and poor cross-domain generalization in blood vessel segmentation by leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes instead of texture-based features.

Method: Introduce VessShape methodology for generating large-scale synthetic datasets with procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with various textures to encourage shape-based learning.

Result: Models pre-trained on VessShape achieve strong few-shot segmentation (4-10 samples) on real datasets and exhibit notable zero-shot capabilities in unseen domains.

Conclusion: Pre-training with strong shape bias is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

TL;DR: A multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping that combines machine learning analysis of geographic data with satellite imagery and human validation to improve educational facility records in developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and infrequent updates of educational facility records in developing regions, where accurate school data is crucial for planning and resource allocation.

Method: Three-tier approach: 1) ML analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure to identify gaps; 2) Medium-resolution satellite imagery (later removed); 3) Very high-resolution imagery with deep learning models for detailed candidate locations, all integrated with human operator validation through an interactive interface.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show the framework provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping, with the medium-resolution tier removed due to insignificant improvements.

Conclusion: The multi-tiered human-in-the-loop strategy effectively combines automated analysis with human validation to create accurate and complete school mapping systems for developing regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

TL;DR: PETAR-4B is a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours to generate spatially grounded radiology reports for 3D medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models are limited to 2D imaging, while medical applications often require 3D analysis of volumetric data like PET/CT scans with small, dispersed lesions and complex reports.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset of 11,000+ lesion descriptions with 3D segmentations from 5,000+ PET/CT exams using hybrid rule-based and LLM extraction. Developed PETAR-4B model that combines PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation.

Result: PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive evaluations show substantial improvements in PET/CT report generation quality.

Conclusion: PETAR advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling effective multimodal reasoning on volumetric medical imaging data.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid

*Hyemin Boo,Eunsang Lee,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Referee is a reference-aware audiovisual deepfake detection method that uses one-shot examples to detect manipulations by matching identity-related queries across reference and target content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes from advanced generative models pose serious threats, and existing audiovisual detection approaches struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries, necessitating more robust detection methods.

Method: Leverages speaker-specific cues from one-shot examples to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal artifacts by matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, jointly reasoning about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation protocols on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of cross-modal identity verification for future deepfake detection, demonstrating that reference-aware approaches can significantly improve generalization to unseen forgeries.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

*Wei Xu,Cheng Wang,Dingkang Liang,Zongchuang Zhao,Xingyu Jiang,Peng Zhang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAUTILUS, an underwater large multimodal model with a vision feature enhancement module, and NautData, a 1.45M image-text dataset for underwater scene understanding across 8 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater exploration has critical applications but lacks large-scale multi-task datasets and suffers from image degradation issues that hinder automated scene understanding.

Method: Constructed NautData dataset with 1.45M image-text pairs, proposed plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module using physical priors from underwater imaging models, and integrated it into LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL to create NAUTILUS.

Result: VFE module consistently improved baseline performance on most tasks across NautData and public underwater datasets, demonstrating NAUTILUS's superiority in underwater scene understanding.

Conclusion: NAUTILUS with VFE module effectively addresses underwater image degradation and advances underwater scene understanding, with data and models publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified multimodal reasoning model that generates interleaved text-image reasoning chains, achieving significant performance gains on vision-centric tasks and demonstrating emergent multimodal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear nature of meaningful interleaved multimodal reasoning chains and explore how text and image thoughts can function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities to mutually advance reasoning.

Method: Built ThinkMorph by fine-tuning on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement, enabling progressive text-image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic.

Result: Achieved 34.7% average improvement over base model on vision-centric benchmarks, matched or surpassed larger proprietary VLMs on out-of-domain tasks, and exhibited emergent multimodal intelligence including visual manipulation skills and adaptive reasoning mode switching.

Conclusion: The findings suggest promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning, demonstrating the value of complementary text-image reasoning chains.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

*Khandoker Ashik Uz Zaman,Mohammad Zahangir Alam,Mohammed N. M. Ali,Mahdi H. Miraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep learning watermarking framework for 3D point clouds that embeds watermarks in singular values using SVD and extracts them with PointNet++, achieving superior performance against geometric attacks compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade conventional watermarks, creating critical need for robust copyright protection in digital media.

Method: Embeds binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD, then uses PointNet++ neural network to extract watermarks resilient to various attacks including rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions.

Result: Deep learning extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD methods, achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and IoU of 0.80 vs SVD's 0.58 accuracy and 0.26 IoU for severe Crop (70%) attacks on ModelNet40 dataset.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based approach enables superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity under severe distortions, providing effective copyright protection for 3D point clouds.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a unified framework that treats historical map images and time series as videos, enabling automated segmentation with few-shot fine-tuning. It improves geometric accuracy for areal features and reduces annotation costs through pseudo time series generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps are valuable archives but challenging to analyze due to stylistic variability and scarce annotated data. Building linked spatio-temporal datasets from map time series is labor-intensive, yet essential for applications like dating buildings and analyzing environmental changes.

Method: Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 processes historical map tiles as videos to leverage memory attention for contextual cues. For time series, it uses the Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and generates pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating temporal transformations.

Result: Experimental results show MapSAM2 effectively learns temporal associations and accurately segments/link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 provides an efficient framework for automated historical map analysis with reduced annotation requirements, and the authors will release both dataset and code to support future research.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple unified principle for learning binary codes using cross-view alignment and coding-rate maximization, achieving state-of-the-art hashing performance with remarkable efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale retrieval requires compact and discriminative representations, but high-dimensional embeddings from foundation models make nearest neighbor search computationally expensive. Hashing provides efficient Hamming distance search, but existing approaches are complex, specialized, and slow to train.

Method: CroVCA uses cross-view code alignment with a single binary cross-entropy loss for consistency across semantically aligned views, plus coding-rate maximization as anti-collapse regularizer. Implemented via HashCoder - a lightweight MLP with batch normalization for balanced codes, usable as probing head on frozen embeddings or with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in just 5 training epochs. Unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes, supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on single GPU. Particularly effective at 16 bits.

Conclusion: CroVCA demonstrates exceptional efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability for binary hashing, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex existing methods.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR is a framework that uses supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to make neural networks more robust against adversarial attacks by learning stable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit gradients to cause misclassification with imperceptible input changes. Current methods need better robustness while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to cluster embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions together while separating different classes.

Result: Achieves impressive results on CIFAR-10 for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 attacks, outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the accuracy-robustness gap.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning and enables accurate source generator attribution.

Conclusion: Diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features

attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,

*Congzhang Shao,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Yue Hu,Danni Wang,Yilin Liu,Rui Pan,Bo Chen,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab is a heterogeneous collaborative perception method that uses a negotiator to create a common representation from multiple agents' local features, reducing domain gaps through structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception causes domain gaps between agents using different fixed perception models, degrading performance. Existing methods that designate one agent's representation as common struggle with significant domain discrepancies.

Method: Uses a negotiator to derive common representation from local representations, with sender-receiver pairs for feature transformation between spaces. Employs structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses to fully distill knowledge into the sender.

Result: Effectively reduces inherent domain gaps between various local representations and enables proper feature alignment even for agents with significant domain discrepancies.

Conclusion: NegoCollab successfully addresses heterogeneous collaboration challenges by negotiating a common representation and using comprehensive alignment losses, improving collaborative perception performance across diverse agents.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Pengjun Huang,Hengyuan Zhang,Hubin Du,Yongtao Liu,Yinglin Wang,Qang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) as a superior alternative to IoU and Wasserstein Distance for object detection, particularly for small objects. GCD addresses scale invariance issues and enables joint optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tiny object detection datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU-based similarity metrics perform poorly on small objects due to sensitivity to minor positional deviations. While Wasserstein Distance was proposed as an alternative, it lacks scale invariance and has slow convergence due to independent optimization of center attributes.

Method: Proposed Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) that analyzes bounding boxes as Gaussian distributions. GCD is designed to be scale-invariant and enables joint optimization of bounding box attributes through analytical examination of its gradient properties.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD-v2 dataset show GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance for tiny object detection. Further validation on MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets demonstrates GCD outperforms Wasserstein Distance across diverse dataset scales.

Conclusion: GCD effectively addresses the limitations of both IoU and Wasserstein Distance by providing scale invariance and joint optimization capabilities, making it a superior choice for bounding box regression loss and label assignment in object detection, especially for small objects.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Motivation: Operando microscopy suffers from measurement noise that limits effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis, preventing accurate observation of dynamic chemical and physical processes in functional materials.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning-based denoising integrated into quantitative microscopy workflows, validated using simulated data and applied across multiple modalities including scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, optical microscopy, and neutron radiography.

Result: Denoising revealed nanoscale chemical/structural heterogeneity in STXM of LFP, enabled automated particle segmentation in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduced noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography for resolving heterogeneous lithium transport.

Conclusion: Deep denoising serves as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the capabilities of previously noise-limited microscopy techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited

Conclusion: Sh-ViT improves robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded

enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate

Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to improve generative model performance while maintaining diversity, addressing limitations of one-step DMD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step DMD models underperform on complex tasks like text-to-video generation due to limited capacity, while multi-step DMD suffers from memory issues, computational depth, instability, and reduced diversity from gradient truncation.

Method: Phased DMD divides SNR range into subintervals with progressive distribution matching and score matching, using phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to reduce learning difficulty while enhancing capacity.

Result: Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities, validated on state-of-the-art models including Qwen-Image (20B) and Wan2.2 (28B).

Conclusion: Phased DMD effectively bridges phase-wise distillation with MoE to overcome limitations of both one-step and multi-step DMD, providing better performance and diversity in complex generative tasks.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

*Soumitra Kundu,Gargi Panda,Saumik Bhattacharya,Aurobinda Routray,Rajlakshmi Guha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LifWavNet is a lifting wavelet network for non-contact ECG reconstruction from radar signals, using learnable wavelets and multi-resolution analysis to outperform existing methods in ECG reconstruction and vital sign estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable unobtrusive cardiac monitoring through non-contact ECG reconstruction from radar signals, overcoming limitations of fixed wavelet approaches in prior models.

Method: Uses a lifting wavelet network with learnable lifting wavelets, lifting and inverse lifting units for adaptive feature capture, and multi-resolution STFT loss for temporal and spectral consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets in ECG reconstruction accuracy and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability).

Conclusion: LifWavNet establishes a robust framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement with interpretable multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

### [81] [Force Characterization of Insect-Scale Aquatic Propulsion Based on Fluid-Structure Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26837)
*Conor K. Trygstad,Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents force characterization of two insect-scale propulsors (single-tailed and double-tailed) for microrobotic swimmers, measuring thrust forces using a custom micro-N-resolution force sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While these fluid-structure interaction (FSI) propulsors have been demonstrated for microrobotic aquatic locomotion, their force characteristics and magnitudes had not been systematically studied.

Method: Used a theoretical framework based on reactive forces and obtained experimental data using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor to measure instantaneous thrust forces.

Result: For the single-tail propulsor: maximum force 0.45 mN and cycle-averaged force 2.97 μN. For the dual-tail propulsor: maximum force 0.61 mN and cycle-averaged force 22.6 μN.

Conclusion: These represent the first measurements of instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale propulsors of this type, providing insights into FSI for efficient microrobotic propulsion.

Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale
propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers
that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs
of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by
soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory
alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable
for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures
for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics
and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.
In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the
notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization
using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and
cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and
2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail
propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test
means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the
first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale
propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient
microrobotic propulsion.

*Jahir Argote-Gerald,Genki Miyauchi,Julian Rau,Paul Trodden,Roderich Gross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for acyclic graph environments using leader-switching mechanism, outperforming naive strategies and showing asymptotic equivalence to full-knowledge strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in maze-like environments (caves, pipes) where multiple robots face communication constraints and congestion issues.

Method: Uses leader-switching mechanism where one agent acts as head using single-agent maze solver while others follow chosen agents, with head role transferring to neighbors when needed to maintain single-agent path.

Result: Outperforms naive strategy in makespan and sum-of-fuel; superior to global-communication in makespan but inferior in sum-of-fuel; asymptotically equivalent to full-knowledge strategy; validated with up to 20 real robots.

Conclusion: The distributed algorithm is feasible and effective for multi-agent maze traversal in constrained environments, balancing performance trade-offs between different strategies.

Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique
challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication
constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a
distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be
represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one
agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the
other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to
neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a
single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in
simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple
single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive,
or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The
algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and
sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of
makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it
is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to
either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots
confirm the feasibility of the approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviTrace is a new VQA benchmark for evaluating VLMs' navigation capabilities, featuring 1000 scenarios with 3000+ expert traces, using a semantic-aware trace score to measure performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of vision-language models for robotic navigation is limited by expensive real-world trials, simplified simulations, and inadequate benchmarks.

Method: Created NaviTrace benchmark with 1000 scenarios where models receive instructions and embodiment types, then output 2D navigation traces evaluated using semantic-aware trace score combining DTW distance, goal error, and embodiment penalties.

Result: Evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art VLMs revealed consistent performance gaps compared to humans, primarily due to poor spatial grounding and goal localization.

Conclusion: NaviTrace provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation evaluation, with publicly available benchmark and leaderboard.

Abstract: Vision-language models demonstrate unprecedented performance and
generalization across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. Integrating these
foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward
building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation
capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified
simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality
Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and
embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a
2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000
expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a
newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time
Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties
derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our
evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial
grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and
reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPINE-HT is a framework that enables heterogeneous robot teams to accomplish complex missions in unstructured environments by grounding LLM reasoning in robot capabilities and online feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-enabled robot teaming methods assume well-structured environments, limiting deployment in uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps where heterogeneous teams must collaborate and adapt.

Method: Three-stage process: 1) LLM generates grounded subtasks from language specifications, 2) feasibility validation, 3) capability-based assignment to robots with online refinement using perception and control feedback.

Result: Simulation experiments show nearly 2x success rate compared to prior approaches. Real-world experiments with 4 different robots achieved 87% success rate in missions requiring capability reasoning and online refinement.

Conclusion: SPINE-HT successfully addresses limitations of current LLM-enabled teaming methods by grounding reasoning in physical world constraints and enabling adaptation through online feedback in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RepV is a neurosymbolic verifier that learns a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable, enabling efficient verification of AI plan compliance with natural-language rules while providing probabilistic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current formal methods require hand-crafted temporal-logic specifications with limited expressiveness, while deep learning approaches have opaque decision processes that can lead to misclassifications with severe consequences in safety-critical domains.

Method: RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds plans with language model-generated rationales into a low-dimensional latent space, using a frozen linear boundary for verification. It starts from a seed set labeled by a model checker and provides probabilistic guarantees based on position in latent space.

Result: RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baselines while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. The refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains.

Conclusion: Safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification, bridging the gap between formal methods and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment deep inside pipes. Current vine robots have complex subsystems and lack real-world validation in industrial settings.

Method: Developed a hermetic and transparent vine robot that encloses all mechanical/electrical components within an airtight transparent body, with a passively adapting enclosed tip mount for sensor transport.

Result: Successfully validated the system through real-world condition assessment and mapping in a wastewater pipe, demonstrating robust performance in industrial settings.

Conclusion: This work advances soft-growing vine robots for pipe inspection by providing a streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development and deployment.

Abstract: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment and
mapping far into the pipe interiors. Soft growing vine robot systems are
particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,
but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in
real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and
implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual
condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design
encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,
airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference
while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed
mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a
passively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and
transparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment
and mapping task in a wastewater pipe. This work advances the use of
soft-growing vine robots in pipe inspection by developing and demonstrating a
robust, streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development
and deployment.

Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to implicit reasoning and reliance on images alone, especially in complex robotics environments.

Method: Integration of panoramic-image and 3D point cloud data with neural perception and symbolic reasoning modules that construct structured scene graphs for explicit spatial relationship modeling.

Result: Superior performance and reliability on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset in crowded human-built environments while maintaining lightweight design suitable for robotics applications.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic framework effectively addresses spatial reasoning limitations of current VLMs by combining neural perception with explicit symbolic reasoning for robotics and embodied AI.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a tactile sensor that can handle fragile, deformable objects by providing both fast dynamic signals for contact detection and static force information for delicate manipulation.

Method: Created a 16-taxel PVDF film sensor sampled at 4kHz for dynamic response, combined with capacitive sensing for static transduction. Used reinforcement learning with human feedback and tactile-based rewards to fine-tune force modulation policies.

Result: Successfully demonstrated delicate grasping of fragile objects and achieved in-hand manipulation of fragile objects - a previously unachieved dexterous contact-rich task.

Conclusion: The multimodal tactile sensing approach combined with learning-based control enables new capabilities in robotic manipulation of delicate objects, particularly in-hand manipulation of fragile items.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger combining a
taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static
transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its
`spiky' response, SpikeATac's 16-taxel PVDF film sampled at 4 kHz provides
fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact. We
characterize the sensitivity of the different modalities, and show that
SpikeATac provides the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping
fragile, deformable objects. Beyond parallel grasping, we show that SpikeATac
can be used in a learning-based framework to achieve new capabilities on a
dexterous multifingered robot hand. We use a learning recipe that combines
reinforcement learning from human feedback with tactile-based rewards to
fine-tune the behavior of a policy to modulate force. Our hardware platform and
learning pipeline together enable a difficult dexterous and contact-rich task
that has not previously been achieved: in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.

Motivation: Underwater robot positioning in confined spaces is challenging due to poor GPS coverage, multipath effects, and reliance on external infrastructure, creating a technological bottleneck for autonomous missions.

Method: Collaborative Aquatic Positioning (CAP) system integrates collaborative robotics and sensor fusion, using a surface vehicle as mobile leader to assist submerged robot positioning through leader-follower control.

Result: Experimental validation shows mean Euclidean distance error of 70 mm in real-time trajectory control without requiring fixed infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features.

Conclusion: CAP delivers a step change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization by leveraging mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control.

Abstract: Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step

TL;DR: A hybrid gripper finger combining rigid structure with inflatable silicone pocket enables active friction modulation, allowing stable grasping of heavy/slippery objects and delicate handling of fragile items without excessive force.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional grippers rely on high normal forces that can damage objects, especially fragile, slippery, or heavy items. There's a need for safer grasping methods that don't depend on excessive force.

Method: Developed a hybrid gripper finger with rigid structural shell and soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The system actively modulates surface friction by controlling internal air pressure in the silicone pocket.

Result: Increasing internal pressure proportionally increases effective friction coefficient. The gripper successfully lifts heavy/slippery objects without increasing gripping force and handles fragile objects (eggs, fruits, paper cups) with minimal damage.

Conclusion: The hybrid gripper with adaptable friction provides a robust, safer alternative to high normal forces, enhancing flexibility in handling diverse objects including delicate and fragile items.

Abstract: Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.

TL;DR: VOPP is a novel parallel online POMDP solver that uses vectorized tensor computations to eliminate synchronization bottlenecks, achieving at least 20X efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art parallel solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning under partial observability is crucial for autonomous robots, and while POMDPs provide a powerful framework, existing parallel POMDP solvers suffer from dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks that offset the benefits of parallelization.

Method: VOPP leverages a recent POMDP formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component, representing all planning data structures as tensors and implementing all planning steps as fully vectorized computations without dependencies between parallel processes.

Result: Experimental results show VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing near-optimal solutions compared to existing state-of-the-art parallel online solvers.

Conclusion: VOPP successfully eliminates synchronization bottlenecks in parallel POMDP solving through vectorized tensor computations, enabling massively parallel planning under partial observability with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

*Robert Pommeranz,Kevin Tebbe,Ralf Heynicke,Gerd Scholl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular C-UAS architecture using PX4-Autopilot and ROS 2 for heterogeneous UAV swarms, enabling hardware integration, swarm communication, formation flight, and computer vision for UAV detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and modular system for counter-UAV operations using heterogeneous swarms that can seamlessly integrate various hardware components and communication technologies.

Method: Built on PX4-Autopilot and ROS 2 framework with independent nodes for each UAV component, abstracted swarm communication, and integration of computer vision algorithms and ground station control.

Result: The architecture successfully supports key functionalities like leader following, formation flight, and UAV detection/tracking, verified through both Gazebo simulations and real-world demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides a flexible and scalable solution for heterogeneous C-UAS operations, demonstrating practical applicability in both simulated and real environments.

Abstract: In this paper a modular and scalable architecture for heterogeneous
swarm-based Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UASs) built on PX4-Autopilot and
Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework is presented. The proposed
architecture emphasizes seamless integration of hardware components by
introducing independent ROS 2 nodes for each component of a Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV). Communication between swarm participants is abstracted in
software, allowing the use of various technologies without architectural
changes. Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation
flight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms
to be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground
station control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.
Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a
Gazebo simulation environment but also in real-world demonstrations.

*Hao Cheng,Yanbo Jiang,Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Keyu Chen,Wenhao Yu,Jianqiang Wang,Sifa Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a new metric for quantifying evasive effort in lateral conflicts for autonomous driving safety evaluation, showing superior performance over existing metrics like ACT and PET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing criticality metrics primarily target longitudinal conflicts and struggle to accurately quantify risks in lateral conflicts, which are prevalent in urban settings, creating a gap in autonomous driving safety assessment.

Method: Proposed MEI refines the Emergency Index by improving the estimation of time available for evasive maneuvers. Validated on a public lateral conflict dataset from Argoverse-2 with over 1,500 AV conflict cases including 500+ critical events, comparing with ACT and PET metrics.

Result: MEI consistently outperforms ACT and PET in accurately quantifying criticality and capturing risk evolution in lateral conflicts.

Conclusion: MEI is a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety assessment framework for autonomous driving, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is
essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an
objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily
target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral
conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper
proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify
evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index
(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,
enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral
conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500
high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is
then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.
Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying
criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI
as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety
assessment framework for autonomous driving. The open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/AutoChengh/MEI.

TL;DR: A data-efficient, flow-based equivariant grasp synthesis architecture that handles diverse gripper types by exploiting kinematic models from geometry alone, implemented in JAX for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-embodiment grasping methods struggle with learning kinematic structures implicitly and face data scarcity issues for diverse gripper designs.

Method: Developed a flow-based equivariant grasp synthesis architecture that deduces kinematic information from gripper and scene geometry, implemented in JAX with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and grasps.

Result: Achieved smoother learning, improved performance, and faster inference time across 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps spanning humanoid hands to parallel yaw grippers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully handles diverse gripper types with variable degrees of freedom while being data-efficient and leveraging the underlying kinematic model through geometric analysis.

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.

*Hehui Zheng,Bhavya Sukhija,Chenhao Li,Klemens Iten,Andreas Krause,Robert K. Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoftAE is an uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns generalizable dynamics models for soft robots by guiding exploration toward underrepresented regions using probabilistic ensemble models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have compliant, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to model for control, and existing data-driven approaches fail to generalize due to narrow task demonstrations or inefficient random exploration.

Method: Uses probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action space without task-specific supervision.

Result: Outperforms random exploration and task-specific model-based reinforcement learning, producing more accurate dynamics models, enabling superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintaining robustness under sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable, reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing progress toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in compliant robots.

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores designing robot rejection behaviors when humans approach too closely, modeling discomfort accumulation based on interpersonal distance and implementing avoidance behaviors using the Dominance axis of the PAD affect model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-robot interaction often involves physical proximity, and robots need to be able to reject approaches appropriately based on context and relationships, similar to how humans flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate approaches.

Method: Modeled discomfort accumulation and decay as a function of interpersonal distance, implemented tolerance and limit-exceeding avoidance behaviors using the Dominance axis of the PAD affect model, and realized these behaviors on an arm robot with graded endurance motions and avoidance actions.

Result: The results demonstrate a coherent pipeline from internal state parameters to graded endurance motions and, when limits are exceeded, to avoidance actions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully models robot rejection behaviors that can flexibly respond to human approaches, providing a framework for more natural and context-aware human-robot interactions involving physical proximity.

Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In
human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such
approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of
a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such
as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the
accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance,
and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the
Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are
realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal
state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to
avoidance actions.

TL;DR: EBT-Policy is a new energy-based architecture that outperforms diffusion-based policies in robotics, requiring less computation and showing emergent capabilities like zero-shot recovery from failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in implicit policies (high computational cost, exposure bias, unstable inference) and scale energy-based models effectively for robotics applications.

Method: Introduces EBT-Policy architecture based on Energy-Based Transformers, learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium dynamics for improved robustness.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-based policies across simulated and real-world tasks, converges in just 2 inference steps (50x reduction), and shows emergent zero-shot recovery capabilities.

Conclusion: EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior under distribution shifts through uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation.

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular soft gripper inspired by octopus biology achieves whole-body proprioceptive morphing through distributed self-sensing pneumatic actuators, enabling adaptive reconfiguration for diverse grasping tasks across various object geometries and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft grippers lack the adaptive whole-body reconfiguration capabilities seen in biological systems like octopuses, being constrained by fixed morphologies or limited to localized deformations.

Method: Developed a modular soft gripper architecture with distributed network of self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables intelligent reconfiguration of entire topology, integrated with proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors.

Result: The gripper successfully transitions between precise pinch and large envelope grasps, expands grasping envelope, enhances generalization across diverse object geometries (standard/irregular) and scales (up to 10×), and enables novel manipulation modalities like multi-object and internal hook grasping.

Conclusion: This low-cost, easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework fusing distributed actuation with integrated sensing offers a new pathway toward achieving biological levels of dexterity in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
of dexterity in robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: CATArena is a tournament-style evaluation platform using board/card games with open-ended scoring to assess LLM agents' learning abilities, addressing score saturation issues in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agents focus on end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, leading to score saturation and dependence on expert annotation. There's a need to evaluate learning ability as a core driver for agent evolution.

Method: Proposed an iterative competitive peer-learning framework where agents refine strategies through repeated interactions and feedback. Created CATArena with four diverse board/card games featuring open-ended scoring without upper limits.

Result: Experimental results show CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding, using both minimal and commercial code agents.

Conclusion: CATArena effectively addresses score saturation issues and enables continuous evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities, focusing on learning ability as key to agent evolution toward human-level intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that decompresses scientific reasoning by generating verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge bases, which power an emergent encyclopedia called SciencePedia with 200,000+ entries across multiple disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific materials often compress reasoning, omitting derivational chains that justify conclusions, which hinders verification and inhibits cross-domain connections between concepts.

Method: Uses a Socratic agent guided by 200 courses to generate 3M first-principles questions, with multiple solver models creating LCoTs that are filtered via sanitization and cross-model consensus. A Brainstorm Search Engine retrieves derivations, and Plato synthesizer narrates chains into articles.

Result: SciencePedia contains ~200,000 entries across math, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. Plato-synthesized articles show higher knowledge-point density and lower factual error rates than baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes a foundation for an ever-expanding verifiable encyclopedia.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Method: Proposes Cognition Envelopes that establish reasoning boundaries to constrain AI decisions, complementing meta-cognition and traditional safety envelopes with systematic definition, validation, and assurance processes.

Result: Introduces a conceptual framework for implementing reasoning boundaries in AI systems, though specific implementation results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Cognition Envelopes provide a systematic approach to address AI decision errors in cyber-physical systems, requiring practical guidelines similar to safety envelopes for effective implementation.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large

*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal masking on spatial chess board data produces stronger playing models than sequential move-based training, challenging the assumption that causal masking is inappropriate for nonsequential data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether causal masking can be effectively applied to spatial data like chess boards, rather than defaulting to sequential linearizations that may introduce information loss.

Method: Trained language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) chess data, comparing performance across representations.

Result: Models trained on spatial board states with causal masking consistently achieved stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data.

Conclusion: Causal masking is a viable and sometimes preferable approach for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, with broader implications beyond chess for handling nonsequential structured data.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

Motivation: Users need fine-grained control over reasoning effort to balance output quality versus latency and cost, but existing methods require knowing problem difficulty beforehand to set token budgets.

Method: Self-adaptive reinforcement learning that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query.

Result: Eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves; enables ~3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance across 1.5B to 32B parameter models.

Conclusion: The approach provides dynamic control over cost-accuracy trade-offs and automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to task difficulty.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NVIDIA implemented a MAPE-driven data flywheel in their NVInfo AI system to continuously improve their enterprise AI agent, achieving significant performance gains through targeted fine-tuning based on user feedback analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise AI agents need continuous adaptation to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and stay aligned with user needs in production environments.

Method: Implemented a MAPE-driven data flywheel with closed-loop system that collects user feedback, analyzes failure modes (routing and query rephrasal errors), and performs targeted fine-tuning using NVIDIA NeMo microservices.

Result: Over 3 months: collected 495 negative samples; identified routing errors (5.25%) and query rephrasal errors (3.2%); fine-tuning achieved 96% routing accuracy with 10x model size reduction and 70% latency improvement; query rephrasal gained 3.7% accuracy with 40% latency reduction.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop feedback structured within a data flywheel transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems, providing a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive AI agents that learn from real-world usage.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: LLMs can now detect errors in mathematical proofs but struggle with partial credit grading. The paper introduces agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and create problem-specific rubrics to improve grading consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With SOTA LLMs now solving most IMO problems, there's a need to assess their ability to grade proofs beyond binary correctness - detecting errors, judging severity, and assigning fair partial credit scores.

Method: Used 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on 1-4 scale with error annotations, and MathArena IMO/USAMO 2025 solutions on 0-7 scale. Introduced agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading.

Result: Models can reliably flag incorrect solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in partial credit assignment. The proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows with problem-specific rubrics significantly improve LLM-based proof grading, addressing calibration gaps in partial credit assignment while maintaining reliable error detection capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Motivation: To explore whether AI can autonomously design computer system mechanisms with human-level creativity and reasoning, moving beyond black-box optimization approaches.

Method: Uses large language models in a human-inspired multi-agent workflow where specialized agents handle reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback.

Result: Produced new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior.

Conclusion: Combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation enables AI to produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured

TL;DR: The paper proposes a practical framework for System of Systems (SoS) lifecycle management that integrates MBSE, PLM, CAD-CAE, digital thread, and digital twin to address challenges in networked product development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear life cycle models are inadequate for modern networked systems where interoperability, variant management, traceability, and cross-organizational governance are critical.

Method: Proposes a reference framework combining MBSE as semantic backbone, PLM for governance, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread/twin for continuous feedback. Identifies four principles and a three-step implementation roadmap.

Result: The approach enables increased change robustness, shorter throughput times, improved reuse, and better sustainability decisions through network-centric development.

Conclusion: The framework helps organizations manage complexity and design scalable SoS value streams, transitioning from product-centric to network-centric development approaches.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fine-grained and instance-tailored steering framework for LLM personalization that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward pass, addressing limitations in handling dynamic user patterns and data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parametric adaptation methods for LLM personalization face limitations in handling dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity scenarios due to low adaptability and data efficiency.

Method: Proposes a framework with two key innovations: a fine-grained steering component that hooks activations from attention and MLP layers to capture nuanced signals, and an input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios (short-to-long text generation, web function calling) show the method significantly enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency, excels in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios, and operates as a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust reasoning and generalization capabilities across diverse GUI navigation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the integrated reasoning approach.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history

Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled

(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art

*Kristina Levina,Nikolaos Pappas,Athanasios Karapantelakis,Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces three generalizations of reward machines (numeric RMs, agenda RMs, coupled RMs) and a new compositional learning algorithm (CoRM) to address scalability issues in long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reward machines struggle with long-horizon problems where subtasks can be executed in any order, as the amount of information to learn grows exponentially with the number of unordered subtasks.

Method: Proposed three RM generalizations: numeric RMs for compact task expression, agenda RMs that track remaining subtasks, and coupled RMs with states associated with each subtask. Introduced CoRM (Q-learning with coupled RMs) as a compositional learning algorithm.

Result: Experiments show that CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed coupled RMs and CoRM algorithm effectively address the scalability limitations of traditional reward machines in complex environments with unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

*Ali Norouzifar,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an outcome-aware process discovery approach that separates desirable and undesirable process executions using discriminative rules, creating focused models that reveal key behavioral differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process discovery creates single models that fail to capture critical differences between desirable (efficient/compliant) and undesirable (inefficient/violating) executions, limiting effectiveness for conformance checking and performance analysis.

Method: Learn interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features to group traces by desirability, then apply process discovery separately within each group to create focused models.

Result: The approach effectively isolates and visualizes critical process patterns, demonstrating its capability to reveal drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions across multiple real-life event logs.

Conclusion: Outcome-aware process discovery through trace grouping based on desirability produces more interpretable and focused models that better capture behavioral differences essential for process analysis and improvement.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs were claimed to contribute to mathematical discovery by generating heuristics for bin packing problems, but this work shows these heuristics are opaque and that simpler, more effective algorithms exist, questioning the actual scientific value of LLM contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess claims that LLMs can contribute to mathematical discovery by analyzing the heuristics they produce for online bin packing problems under specific distributions.

Method: Detailed analysis of LLM-generated heuristics, examination of their behavior and interpretability, and development of new simpler algorithms tailored to the specific bin packing instances.

Result: LLM-generated heuristics are largely opaque even to experts, and simpler, more efficient, interpretable, and generalizable algorithms can be derived, suggesting the problem instances are relatively simple.

Conclusion: Claims about LLMs' mathematical contributions need rigorous validation and contextualization, as the specific instances studied may not have been previously examined, limiting the actual scientific value of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

TL;DR: ToolScope is an agentic framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize external tools for complex visual question answering tasks through unified global planning and local multimodal perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning due to the complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, particularly in long-horizon visual question answering tasks where visual context degradation is a major challenge.

Method: ToolScope consists of three components: Global Navigator for high-level strategic guidance, Agentic Executor for iterative local perception using external tools (Search, Code, and Perceive), and Response Synthesizer for organizing reasoning into coherent outputs.

Result: ToolScope achieved strong generalization across four VQA benchmarks (VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista), with an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA tasks and demonstrates the effectiveness of unifying global planning with local multimodal perception for enhanced MLLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

*Yueyang Wang,Mehmet Dogar,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates visual and motor constraints to model pedestrian-driver interactions, showing improved realism over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pedestrian-driver interaction models lack flexibility and overlook sensory/motor constraints that shape human perception and action in interactive scenarios.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with four variants: no constraints, motor constraints only, visual constraints only, and both constraints combined, evaluated on real-world unsignalised crossing data.

Result: The combined model with both visual and motor constraints performed best. Motor constraints led to smoother human-like movements, while visual constraints introduced perceptual uncertainty and more cautious behavior. Outperformed supervised behavioral cloning in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: Multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising approach for simulating realistic road user interactions, accounting for individual differences through population-level parameter distributions.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the "intention expression gap" where humans struggle to convey complex thoughts to AI, leading to inefficient trial-and-error loops, especially across diverse user expertise levels.

Method: Trains Nous using information theory principles, defining information gain from dialogue as intrinsic reward (equivalent to Shannon entropy reduction), with automated simulation pipeline for dataset generation.

Result: Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality in scientific diagram generation, remains robust to varying user expertise, and shows evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation.

Conclusion: Offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving user intent uncertainty in human-AI collaboration, moving from passive instruction following to Socratic collaboration.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepCompress is a framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models by adaptively adjusting reasoning length based on problem difficulty, using shorter paths for simple problems and longer exploration for hard ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving reasoning efficiency (SFT or RL with token-length rewards) often sacrifice accuracy. LRMs suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones.

Method: Uses adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as "Simple" or "Hard" in real-time, encouraging shorter reasoning for simple problems and longer exploratory chains for hard problems through a dual-reward strategy.

Result: Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent outperformance of baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Conclusion: DeepCompress successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in LRMs by adaptively adjusting reasoning length based on problem difficulty, demonstrating that longer responses can contain more correct solutions for difficult problems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

*Yuhao Zhang,Dingxin Hu,Tinghao Yu,Hao Liu,Yiting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFM is a novel method that uses formal languages and symbolic engines to generate high-fidelity synthetic geometric data, significantly improving MLLMs' performance on geometric reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to scarce high-quality geometric data. Existing synthetic data methods produce limited, noisy, and unrealistic geometric diagrams.

Method: Uses formal languages to explore condition combinations in metric space, generates geometric problems different from originals, and ensures correctness through symbolic engine verification.

Result: Models trained with GeoFM data outperform GPT-4o by 18.7% on MathVista and 16.5% on GeoQA, and beat leading open-source models by 5.7% on MathVista and 2.7% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: GeoFM effectively addresses the geometric data scarcity problem by generating diverse, high-fidelity synthetic data that significantly enhances MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

### [124] [Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544)
*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench is a formally verifiable diagnostic benchmark that systematically evaluates LLM reasoning through temporal trace evaluation (TTE) and temporal causal evaluation (TCE), revealing significant performance drops as reasoning complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning evaluation methods have limitations - ad-hoc datasets may contain bias and lack formal verification, while formal proof systems like Lean don't capture real-world agentic decision chains, creating a gap in reasoning benchmarks.

Method: TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks: TTE tests LLM's ability to understand and simulate multi-step reasoning system execution, and TCE tests multi-step causal reasoning and cause-effect relation extraction from complex systems.

Result: Models scored 65.6% on TCE-normal and only 7.5% on TCE-hard, showing that while state-of-the-art LLMs understand the TCE task, their performance significantly degrades as system complexity increases.

Conclusion: TempoBench provides the first formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic benchmark for systematically analyzing LLM reasoning, revealing clear limitations in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks despite basic understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

*Ali Asgarov,Umid Suleymanov,Aadyant Khatri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMA is a multi-agent framework that enhances mathematical reasoning by orchestrating specialized agents for independent reasoning, targeted searches, and knowledge synthesis through a moderator mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented models rely on single perspectives, inflexible search strategies, and struggle to combine information from multiple sources effectively for mathematical reasoning.

Method: SIGMA uses specialized agents that generate hypothetical passages for optimized retrieval from their analytic perspectives, with a moderator mechanism to synthesize findings, ensuring context-sensitive and computation-efficient knowledge integration.

Result: SIGMA outperforms both open- and closed-source systems on MATH500, AIME, and GPQA benchmarks, achieving 7.4% absolute performance improvement.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InnovatorBench is a new benchmark for evaluating AI agents in realistic LLM research tasks, featuring 20 diverse tasks requiring runnable artifacts and comprehensive assessment. It's supported by ResearchGym environment and tested with frontier models showing promise but also limitations in long-horizon decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent benchmarks are too narrow and simplified, failing to capture the complexity of real scientific research workflows. There's a need for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing actual LLM research tasks.

Method: Developed InnovatorBench with 20 tasks across Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction. Created ResearchGym environment with rich action spaces, distributed execution, and monitoring. Implemented ReAct agent using frontier models (Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, Kimi-K2) coupling reasoning with executable planning.

Result: Frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks but struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making (impatience, poor resource management, template-based reasoning). Agents require over 11 hours to achieve best performance, demonstrating benchmark difficulty.

Conclusion: InnovatorBench represents a significant advancement in AI agent evaluation for scientific research, revealing both capabilities and limitations of current models while providing a challenging platform for future development of autonomous research agents.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

*Heng Ping,Arijit Bhattacharjee,Peiyu Zhang,Shixuan Li,Wei Yang,Anzhe Cheng,Xiaole Zhang,Jesse Thomason,Ali Jannesari,Nesreen Ahmed,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriMoA is a training-free mixture-of-agents framework that improves HDL generation through quality-guided caching and multi-path generation, achieving 15-30% Pass@1 improvements without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for HDL generation but face challenges with limited parametric knowledge and domain constraints. Current multi-agent approaches suffer from noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration.

Method: Proposes VeriMoA with two innovations: 1) quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain intermediate HDL outputs with quality-based ranking, and 2) multi-path generation using C++ and Python as intermediate representations for two-stage specification-to-HDL translation.

Result: Achieves 15-30% improvements in Pass@1 across VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks, enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without training costs.

Conclusion: VeriMoA provides an effective training-free paradigm for HDL generation that enhances reasoning through collaborative generation while overcoming limitations of current multi-agent approaches.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

### [128] [Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623)
*Qiusi Zhan,Hyeonjeong Ha,Rui Yang,Sirui Xu,Hanyang Chen,Liang-Yan Gui,Yu-Xiong Wang,Huan Zhang,Heng Ji,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAT is the first framework for injecting visual backdoor attacks into MLLM-based embodied agents using environmental objects as triggers, achieving up to 80% attack success rates while maintaining normal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs enable embodied agents to perceive and act from visual inputs, but this creates a new security vulnerability where visual triggers can persistently hijack agent behavior.

Method: BEAT uses (1) diverse training across scenes, tasks, and trigger placements, and (2) a two-stage training with supervised fine-tuning followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning that treats trigger discrimination as preference learning.

Result: BEAT achieves up to 80% attack success rates across benchmarks and MLLMs, maintains strong benign performance, and generalizes to out-of-distribution triggers. CTL boosts backdoor activation by up to 39% over naive SFT.

Conclusion: The framework exposes critical security risks in MLLM-based embodied agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

### [129] [Validity Is What You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27628)
*Sebastian Benthall,Andrew Clark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic AI is defined as a software delivery mechanism that autonomously operates applications in complex enterprise settings, with success depending on user validation rather than just foundation model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear definition of Agentic AI and emphasize that its success depends on validation by end users and stakeholders, not just the capabilities of foundation models like LLMs.

Method: Proposes a realist definition of Agentic AI as a software delivery mechanism comparable to SaaS, and discusses the importance of validation tools and techniques for end users rather than just model evaluation.

Result: The analysis shows that with proper validation measures, foundation models can often be replaced with simpler, faster, and more interpretable models for core logic in Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: Validity is the key requirement for Agentic AI systems, and LLMs are just one possible option to achieve it - simpler models may often suffice when proper validation is in place.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Apollo is a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering to train LLM agents on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLM agents on long-horizon tasks are either too expensive (behavior cloning) or ineffective (outcome-driven sampling). There's a need for a more efficient approach that can handle domain-specialized tasks that take days or months.

Method: Apollo combines asynchronous human guidance where annotators intervene only when agents drift from promising trajectories, with supervision control that filters out sub-optimal actions to prevent error propagation.

Result: When applied to train GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieved over 50% improvement over untrained baseline and 28% improvement over variant without human interaction, demonstrating effectiveness in long-horizon environments.

Conclusion: Apollo's human-in-the-loop sampling approach is robust and effective for handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks, highlighting the critical role of human guidance in training LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolChord is a new approach for structure-based drug design that aligns protein and molecule representations using NatureLM for generation and diffusion-based encoding, while using DPO to optimize for desired pharmacological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations in drug design, and ensuring generated drugs have desired pharmacological properties.

Method: Integrates NatureLM (autoregressive model unifying text, molecules, and proteins) as molecule generator with diffusion-based structure encoder, and uses Direct Preference Optimization with property-aware dataset to guide molecule generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark across key evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential as a practical tool for structure-based drug design by effectively aligning representations and optimizing for drug properties.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.
