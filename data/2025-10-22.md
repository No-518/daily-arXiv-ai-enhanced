### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent is a multi-agent framework that dynamically optimizes training parameters using non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms, achieving superior performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-label image classification methods use static configurations that struggle with dynamic visual-semantic landscapes, creating a need for adaptive training strategies.

Method: Deploys autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions using non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms with composite rewards, enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training.

Result: Achieved mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T) on Pascal VOC, 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN) on COCO, and 60.9 on VG-256, with accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: MAT-Agent provides a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models and advances adaptive deep learning through its collaborative, real-time optimization approach.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO is a dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity for efficient multimodal LLM instruction tuning, achieving 98.2% of full-data performance using only 20% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods for MLLMs have high computational overhead and suboptimal selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity, creating a training bottleneck.

Method: CoIDO uses a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample to learn data distribution, employing homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation to jointly balance importance and diversity.

Result: When trained on 20% of data and applied to select 20% subset, CoIDO achieved 98.2% of full-data fine-tuning performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B across ten downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoIDO provides an efficient and scalable data selection approach that dramatically reduces computational costs while maintaining near-full performance in multimodal LLM instruction tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Model for early visual treatment response prediction in glioblastoma patients, generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization using classifier-free guidance with survival information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma patients show highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses that take at least two months to observe via MRI. Early prediction of treatment response is crucial for personalized medicine, but most TRP approaches rely on timeseries data rather than visual prediction.

Method: A Latent Diffusion Model with concatenation-based conditioning from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, enhanced by classifier-free guidance using survival information to reflect post-treatment tumor evolution. Trained on 140 GBM patients with pre/post T1-Gd MRI, tumor delineations, and survival data.

Result: Model was trained and tested on a local dataset of 140 GBM patients from Centre François Baclesse, including pre/post T1-Gd MRI, expert-delineated tumor localizations, and survival information.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables early visual treatment response prediction by generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment data, potentially advancing personalized medicine for glioblastoma patients by providing earlier insights into therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An embedding-based AI image detection framework that uses image embeddings and vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from human-created ones, maintaining robustness against perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement in generative AI and LLMs enables creation of highly realistic digital content that is often indistinguishable from human-created images, posing challenges for digital content authentication and trust maintenance.

Method: Utilizes image embeddings from five benchmark embedding models and vector similarity analysis, based on the hypothesis that AI-generated images cluster closer to other AI content while human-created images cluster in their own domain.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness with moderate to high perturbations minimally impacting embedding signatures, and perturbed images maintaining close similarity to their original versions.

Conclusion: The proposed solution provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMIS-Net is a novel framework that addresses individual differences in backchannel behaviors through multi-scale individual standardization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannels are crucial for responsive AI systems but exhibit significant individual differences across frame-level (intensity) and sequence-level (frequency/rhythm) scales. Existing emotion recognition methods operate at single scales and fail to address multi-scale behavioral cues and individual variations.

Method: Proposed CMIS-Net uses cascaded multi-scale individual standardization to extract normalized backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines at both frame and sequence levels. Includes implicit data augmentation to address training data distributional bias.

Result: CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments and visualizations.

Conclusion: The multi-scale individual standardization approach successfully addresses the complex pattern recognition problem of backchannel behaviors by focusing on relative changes from individual baselines rather than absolute expression values.

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ultra-efficient post-training method that converts large pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step samplers through velocity field self-distillation, eliminating the need for retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shortcutting methods require specialized step-size embeddings that are incompatible with standard models, making retraining from scratch nearly as costly as pretraining itself.

Method: Uses velocity field self-distillation to impart aggressive shortcut mechanisms to standard flow matching models, working on velocity field rather than sample space with online self-guided distillation.

Result: Trains efficiently (e.g., 3-step Flux in <1 A100 day), can be incorporated into pretraining, and enables few-shot distillation (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for billion-parameter models with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient way to shortcut large diffusion models without retraining, achieving high performance with minimal computational cost and enabling few-shot distillation capabilities.

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid computer vision approach that generates pseudo-IMU data from 3D joint keypoints to monitor scuba diver safety in underwater environments where traditional sensors fail due to wireless signal attenuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human activity recognition methods using direct image analysis or wearable IMUs are ineffective in underwater environments due to wireless signal attenuation, which prevents conventional diver-worn sensors from communicating with AUVs.

Method: Leverages computer vision to generate high-fidelity motion data by creating a "pseudo-IMU" from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints, circumventing wireless communication issues in water.

Result: Successfully applied to identify anomalous scuba diver behavior signaling medical emergencies like cardiac arrest, with the system integrated onboard an AUV and tested in simulated distress scenarios.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates utility and effectiveness for advancing robotic monitoring and improving diver safety in challenging underwater environments where traditional sensing approaches fail.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray structures, which is valuable for medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing applications.

Method: Collects paired RGB and X-ray data, performs hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and proposes an X-ray reference loss for consistent internal structures.

Result: Effectively addresses challenges of disparate data representations between modalities and limited paired datasets, extending 3DGS applicability.

Conclusion: InsideOut significantly enhances visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities across various domains by fusing RGB and X-ray imaging.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

*Sungmin Cho,Sungbum Park,Insoo Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that uses 3D object templates and 2D proposals with uncertainty-aware similarity matching, achieving SOTA on BOP Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a powerful zero-shot detection framework that doesn't require additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the challenge of detecting unseen objects using only 3D models.

Method: Uses 2D multi-view templates from 3D objects and 2D proposals; integrates class and patch embeddings with GeM pooling; employs joint similarity metric with absolute/relative scores; refines with uncertainty-aware object prior.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks without any training.

Conclusion: MUSE provides a powerful and generalizable training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

*Gerard Asbert,Pau Torras,Lei Kang,Alicia Fornés,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a GAN to generate synthetic handwritten musical scores to address data scarcity in Optical Music Recognition, achieving high visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of real annotated data for handwritten historical musical scores hinders Optical Music Recognition (OMR) development, similar to challenges in Handwritten Text Recognition where synthetic data helped.

Method: Implemented a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembled generated symbols into full scores using Smashcima engraving software.

Result: Generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation as evaluated through systematic visual fidelity assessment.

Conclusion: GAN-based synthetic score generation shows promise for addressing data scarcity in OMR, with generated symbols achieving sufficient realism to potentially improve recognition model training.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

### [11] [Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Gender Classification Algorithms: A Data-Centric Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17873)
*Tadesse K Bahiru,Natnael Tilahun Sinshaw,Teshager Hailemariam Moges,Dheeraj Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses gender classification bias in datasets and proposes BalancedFace, a new dataset that reduces demographic imbalances and improves fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic imbalances from training data, leading to biased performance across different subgroups.

Method: Audited five gender classification datasets, trained classifiers on the most balanced ones, and created BalancedFace by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace while filling demographic gaps to equalize subgroup representation.

Result: BalancedFace reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and improves Disparate Impact score by 63% compared to the next-best dataset, with minimal overall accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Data-centric interventions like BalancedFace significantly improve fairness in gender classification and provide a valuable resource for fair AI research.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

### [12] [3D Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Class-Aware and Geometry-Guided Pseudo-Label Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17875)
*Xiaoxu Xu,Xuexun Liu,Jinlong Li,Yitian Yuan,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates geometric priors with class-aware guidance to generate high-quality pseudo labels through iterative refinement and self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in 3D WSSS where low-quality pseudo labels and insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors create bottlenecks for developing high-performance models.

Method: Uses Class-Aware Label Refinement for balanced pseudo labels, Geometry-Aware Label Refinement with 3D geometric constraints to filter low-confidence labels, and Label Update strategy with Self-Training to propagate labels to unlabeled regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks with remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively integrates 3D geometric priors with class-aware guidance to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels, enabling high-performance 3D WSSS models through iterative refinement and self-training.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

### [13] [Investigating Demographic Bias in Brain MRI Segmentation: A Comparative Study of Deep-Learning and Non-Deep-Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17999)
*Ghazal Danaee,Marc Niethammer,Jarrett Rushmore,Sylvain Bouix*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates fairness in medical image segmentation by testing three deep learning models and one traditional method on nucleus accumbens segmentation across different demographic groups, finding that race-matched training improves accuracy for some models while others show demographic robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address growing concerns about algorithmic fairness in medical image analysis, particularly performance disparities based on race and sex in segmentation tasks, and to understand how demographic factors affect both segmentation accuracy and derived volumetric measurements.

Method: Used three segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr) and one atlas-based method (ANTs) on MRI images of nucleus accumbens across four demographic subgroups. Employed manually labeled gold-standard segmentations, fairness metrics, and linear mixed models to analyze demographic effects on both segmentation performance and derived volumes.

Result: Training on race-matched data significantly improved segmentation accuracy for ANTs and UNesT, while nnU-Net showed robust performance across demographics. Sex effects observed with manual segmentation were preserved in biased models, but race effects disappeared in all but one model.

Conclusion: Demographic matching in training data affects segmentation fairness, with some models being more sensitive to demographic factors than others. The study highlights the importance of considering fairness in medical image analysis and the varying robustness of different segmentation approaches to demographic biases.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

TL;DR: ManzaiSet is the first large-scale multimodal dataset of viewer responses to Japanese manzai comedy, addressing Western bias in affective computing. It reveals three distinct viewer types and shows positive viewing order effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Western-centric bias in affective computing by creating a culturally specific dataset for Japanese comedy (manzai) and enable development of culturally aware emotion AI.

Method: Collected facial videos and audio from 241 participants watching up to 10 professional manzai performances in randomized order. Used k-means clustering for viewer typing, individual-level analysis for order effects, and automated humor classification with viewer response modeling.

Result: Identified three viewer types: High and Stable Appreciators (72.8%), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2%), and Variable Improvers (14.0%). Found positive viewing order effect (mean slope=0.488) contradicting fatigue hypotheses. No type-wise differences in humor classification after FDR correction.

Conclusion: The dataset enables culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems tailored to non-Western contexts, demonstrating the importance of cultural specificity in affective computing.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing

Conclusion: SAVANT addresses data scarcity in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems by enabling local deployment at near-zero cost.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Red palm mite infestation causes significant economic losses in palm cultivation, requiring accurate early detection for effective management.

Method: Used TriggerNet framework with Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV for interpretable AI. Applied CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN on RGB images of 11 plant species. Used Snorkel for automated disease classification labeling.

Result: Developed a comprehensive framework for plant classification and disease detection across multiple plant species with four disease classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective AI-based approach for early detection of red palm mite infestation, enabling better management strategies for agricultural productivity.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

TL;DR: HouseTour is a method that generates smooth 3D camera trajectories and natural language summaries from image collections, using diffusion processes constrained by camera poses and 3D Gaussian splatting for video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning, making it difficult to generate spatially-aware 3D tours from image collections for applications like real estate and tourism.

Method: Uses diffusion process constrained by known camera poses to generate smooth trajectories, integrates this 3D information into VLM for grounded descriptions, and synthesizes final videos using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views.

Result: Experiments show improved performance over independent task methods, with evaluation of both individual and end-to-end performance using a new joint metric. Created HouseTour dataset with 1,200+ house-tour videos.

Conclusion: Enables automated professional-quality video creation for real estate and tourism without requiring specialized expertise or equipment, demonstrating that incorporating 3D camera trajectories improves text generation.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generative models lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user-specified masks or annotations.

Method: Built a dataset from 464 unique (part, subject) pairs (semantic atoms), generated 37k prompts, trained a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance to enforce semantic identity and spatial layout.

Result: Outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality based on human evaluations and proposed PartEval metric.

Conclusion: Chimera successfully enables novel object generation by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions with improved accuracy and quality.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using SEM imaging combined with YOLO-based machine learning for automated microplastic detection, focusing on filtration scenarios with patterned backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are pervasive pollutants that are difficult to detect and analyze manually, especially in large screening studies. Current detection methods require manual analysis, limiting efficiency.

Method: Combination of SEM imaging and YOLO-based machine learning object detection, focusing on filtration scenarios with symmetric and repetitive background patterns.

Result: Found differences in YOLO model performance for microplastic detection tasks and identified the importance of preprocessing optimization. Also revealed challenges with limited expert-labeled training data.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows promise for automated microplastic detection but faces challenges including limited labeled data and the need for preprocessing optimization.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT uses adaptive patch sizes in Vision Transformers to reduce input sequence length, achieving 40-50% speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ViTs use uniform patch sizes regardless of image content, leading to inefficient long input sequences for high-resolution images.

Method: APT uses multiple different patch sizes within the same image - larger patches for homogeneous areas and smaller patches for complex regions to reduce total tokens.

Result: 40% speedup on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance; up to 30% faster training/inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: APT provides significant efficiency improvements for Vision Transformers through adaptive patch sizing, enabling faster inference and training without performance loss.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental transformation in 3D reconstruction driven by 3DGS advances, while overcoming its limitations in memory footprint, lighting representation, and secondary-ray effects.

Method: Uses explicit scene modeling with 3D Gaussians and efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, integrating with common graphics pipelines.

Result: Provides real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis and enables applications in surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and content generation.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers efficient rendering and suitability for feed-forward pipelines despite current limitations, with ongoing research addressing its challenges.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes In-Context Distillation (ICD), an online method where small vision-language models collaborate with stronger teacher models at inference time using sparse demonstrations to bridge performance gaps without costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying vision-language models in low-resource, budget-constrained settings where large models are impractical and small models require expensive fine-tuning to match performance.

Method: Online In-Context Distillation framework with cross-modal demonstration selection, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries.

Result: Significantly boosts small model performance (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with teacher's zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: ICD provides an efficient alternative to fine-tuning for adapting small VLMs to low-resource settings, enabling strong performance through sparse collaboration with teacher models at inference time.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents SafeCoop, a defense system for natural-language-based collaborative driving that addresses security vulnerabilities like message loss, hallucinations, and adversarial attacks through semantic firewalls and multi-source consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems face challenges with high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. While natural language communication offers semantic richness and lower bandwidth, it introduces new vulnerabilities in collaborative driving systems.

Method: The authors develop SafeCoop, an agentic defense pipeline that integrates semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment.

Result: SafeCoop was evaluated in CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic analysis of security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving and offers guidance for advancing safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-in-World is the first platform to benchmark generative world models for embodied AI tasks using closed-loop evaluation, revealing that visual quality alone doesn't ensure task success and that controllability, data scaling, and inference-time compute are crucial factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for generative world models focus on open-loop evaluation that emphasizes visual quality in isolation, failing to address whether these models actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks in realistic agent-environment interactions.

Method: Introduced World-in-World platform with unified online planning strategy and standardized action API, curating four closed-loop environments that evaluate diverse world models with task success as the primary metric rather than visual quality.

Result: Three key findings: (1) visual quality doesn't guarantee task success - controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading pretrained video generators; (3) allocating more inference-time compute substantially improves closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings and demonstrates that closed-loop evaluation reveals critical factors for practical utility that are missed by traditional open-loop benchmarks focused solely on visual quality.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel one-shot pruning framework using explainable deep learning and causal-aware pruning to reduce model size with minimal performance impact, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of structured pruning methods that require iterative retraining, and the performance drop in existing one-shot pruning approaches applied at post-training.

Method: Causal-aware pruning approach leveraging cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process, applied to CNN and vision transformer baselines pre-trained on classification tasks.

Result: Consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size with minimal impact on performance, outperforming counterparts and offering the best trade-off without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed one-shot pruning framework effectively reduces model size while maintaining performance, providing a practical solution for neural network compression in deployment-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: Existing stereo vision methods struggle with lunar reconstruction due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. Deep learning models trained on human-scale datasets cannot be directly transferred to lunar conditions.

Method: Created LunarStereo dataset using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models, covering diverse altitudes, lighting conditions, and viewing angles. Adapted MASt3R model through fine-tuning on this dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real lunar data demonstrate significant improvements over zero-shot baselines in 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments by providing physically grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale

*Fatima AlGhamdi,Omar Alharbi,Abdullah Aldwyish,Raied Aljadaany,Muhammad Kamran J Khan,Huda Alamri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VelocityNet uses head detection and optical flow to track person velocities, classifies them into motion categories, and detects anomalies through percentile-based scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with crowded scenes due to occlusions and dynamic motion patterns, lacking adaptability to varying densities and interpretable anomaly indicators.

Method: Dual-pipeline framework combining head detection and dense optical flow for person-specific velocity extraction, hierarchical clustering for motion categorization, and percentile-based anomaly scoring.

Result: Effective real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns in densely crowded environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet successfully addresses challenges in crowded scene anomaly detection through interpretable velocity-based analysis and adaptive motion pattern learning.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

*Chengrun Li,Corentin Royer,Haozhe Luo,Bastian Wittmann,Xia Li,Ibrahim Hamamci,Sezgin Er,Anjany Sekuboyina,Bjoern Menze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadDiagSeg-D dataset and RadDiagSeg-M model for joint generation of diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in medical vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision language models struggle to simultaneously generate diagnostic text and segmentation masks, limiting their clinical application value.

Method: Created RadDiagSeg-D dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation, then developed RadDiagSeg-M model for joint text-and-mask generation.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M shows strong performance across all components of multi-target text-and-mask generation, establishing a competitive baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the need for enriched contextual information in assistive diagnosis by providing both descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks simultaneously.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

### [30] [EMA-SAM: Exponential Moving-average for SAM-based PTMC Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18213)
*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Jung Suk Sim,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM is a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that adds a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer to stabilize tumor segmentation in ultrasound videos, improving temporal coherence while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTMC is increasingly managed with RFA, but accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos is challenging due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. SAM-2's frame-independent design causes unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound.

Method: EMA-SAM incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into SAM-2's memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumor across frames while preserving temporal coherence and rapidly adapting when clear evidence reappears.

Result: On PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improved maxDice from 0.82 to 0.86 and maxIoU from 0.72 to 0.76, reducing false positives by 29%. On external benchmarks, it achieved consistent gains of 2-5 Dice points over SAM-2 while adding <0.1% FLOPs and maintaining ~30 FPS real-time throughput.

Conclusion: EMA-SAM establishes a robust and efficient framework for stable tumor tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

### [31] [VLSU: Mapping the Limits of Joint Multimodal Understanding for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18214)
*Shruti Palaskar,Leon Gatys,Mona Abdelrahman,Mar Jacobo,Larry Lindsey,Rutika Moharir,Gunnar Lund,Yang Xu,Navid Shiee,Jeffrey Bigham,Charles Maalouf,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLSU is a framework that systematically evaluates multimodal safety by analyzing joint image-text interpretation, revealing that models fail at compositional reasoning despite good unimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation treats vision and language separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination, and fails to distinguish clearly unsafe from borderline cases.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation to construct a benchmark of 8,187 samples across 17 safety patterns and 15 harm categories, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Models achieve 90%+ accuracy on unimodal safety but degrade to 20-55% when joint reasoning is required; 34% of joint classification errors occur despite correct individual modality classification; models struggle to balance refusal of unsafe vs borderline content.

Conclusion: VLSU exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps, providing a critical test bed for robust vision-language safety research.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

### [32] [Beyond Frequency: Scoring-Driven Debiasing for Object Detection via Blueprint-Prompted Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18229)
*Xinhao Cai,Liulei Li,Gensheng Pei,Tao Chen,Jinshan Pan,Yazhou Yao,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generation-based debiasing framework for object detection that addresses representation diversity limitations in prior methods by introducing representation scores to guide unbiased layout generation and using visual blueprints with generative alignment for high-quality synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior debiasing methods are limited by representation diversity, naive generative augmentation preserves biases, and current layout-to-image synthesis lacks fidelity and control for complex scenes. Instance frequency alone is insufficient for addressing true data needs.

Method: Introduces representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond frequency, creates unbiased layouts, replaces text prompts with precise visual blueprints, and employs generative alignment strategy between detector and generator.

Result: Significantly narrows performance gap for underrepresented object groups - improves large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over baseline, and surpasses prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy in generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses debiasing in object detection through representation-aware layout generation and high-quality synthesis, achieving substantial improvements for underrepresented object categories.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR is a novel approach for compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping, achieving high OCR accuracy (97% at <10x compression) and practical performance, outperforming existing methods while using significantly fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of compressing long contexts through optical 2D mapping, addressing challenges in historical document processing and memory management in large language models.

Method: Uses a two-component architecture: DeepEncoder for maintaining low activations under high-resolution input with high compression ratios, and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder to manage vision tokens efficiently.

Result: Achieves 97% OCR precision at compression ratios <10x, maintains ~60% accuracy at 20x compression, outperforms GOT-OCR2.0 and MinerU2.0 with fewer tokens, and can process 200k+ pages daily on a single A100-40G.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR shows significant promise for long-context compression research and practical applications, offering efficient document processing capabilities with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at
http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

*Ajinkya Khoche,Gergő László Nagy,Maciej Wozniak,Thomas Gustafsson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP is a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges the synthetic-to-real gap in 3D object classification by strategically combining synthetic CAD data and real-world LiDAR scans through a curriculum-based data mixing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot 3D object classification faces challenges due to domain gaps between synthetic training data and real-world sparse, noisy LiDAR scans. Methods trained only on synthetic data fail in outdoor scenes, while real-data-only approaches lack semantic diversity for rare objects.

Method: Proposes a pipeline to generate object-level triplets (point cloud, image, text) from real-world driving data, and introduces a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first trains on semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting to real-world scans.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving by 19.3% on nuScenes over prior methods. The approach is highly label-efficient, with just 1.5% real-world samples per batch boosting zero-shot accuracy by 27%.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is key to robust open-vocabulary 3D perception. The method demonstrates strong generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and inconsistencies/missing details when fusing multi-view features from 2D models.

Method: Two main modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction (augments each mask with rich semantic context) and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation (selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robustness and generality, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality applications.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D

*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Weibin Qiu,Zhaocheng Jin,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperbolic space learning method with temporal motion prior for 3D human mesh recovery from videos, addressing hierarchical structure limitations in Euclidean space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods learn features in Euclidean space, which struggles to capture the natural hierarchical structure of human bodies (torso-limbs-fingers), leading to inaccurate mesh reconstruction.

Method: 1) Temporal motion prior extraction module combining 3D pose sequences and image features; 2) Hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy using temporal motion prior; 3) Hyperbolic mesh optimization loss for stable learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space learning with temporal motion prior effectively captures hierarchical human structure and produces accurate, smooth 3D human meshes from videos.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: UWBench is a comprehensive benchmark for underwater vision-language understanding, featuring 15,003 high-resolution underwater images with human-verified annotations including object referring expressions and question-answer pairs, designed to evaluate VLMs on tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering in challenging underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large vision-language models excel in natural scene understanding but struggle with underwater environments due to unique challenges like light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle scattering, coupled with the need for specialized marine knowledge.

Method: The authors introduce UWBench, a dataset of 15,003 high-resolution underwater images from diverse aquatic environments, annotated with 15,281 object referring expressions and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering various reasoning capabilities. They establish three benchmarks: detailed image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs show that underwater understanding remains challenging with substantial room for improvement, demonstrating the need for specialized benchmarks and models for underwater vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: UWBench provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supports applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

TL;DR: A two-stage network for 3D human mesh recovery that extracts latent information from frequency domains and uses low-dimensional mesh-pose interaction to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods fail to fully exploit latent information, leading to limb misalignment and insufficient local details, while attention-based methods have high computational costs.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Extract global and local information from low/high-frequency image features into hybrid latent frequency domain features, 2) Use low-dimensional mesh-pose interaction through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization to model interactions between 3D mesh template and 3D pose.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving better reconstruction accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses issues in 3D human mesh recovery by fully exploiting latent information and introducing efficient low-dimensional interaction learning, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: TreeFedDG is a novel tree topology framework for federated domain generalization in medical image segmentation that addresses global drift through hierarchical parameter aggregation, style mixing, progressive fusion, and ensemble inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning methods fail to handle information aggregation imbalance in cross-domain medical imaging, leading to Global Drift (GD) problem and poor model generalization performance.

Method: 1) Hierarchical parameter aggregation using tree-structured topology; 2) Parameter difference-based style mixing (FedStyle); 3) Progressive personalized fusion strategy; 4) Feature similarity-guided ensemble inference from tree structure.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches on two public datasets, achieving better cross-domain performance balance.

Conclusion: TreeFedDG effectively addresses FedDG-GD problem through hierarchical knowledge organization and achieves superior generalization in federated medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

### [40] [StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269)
*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM is a training-free framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks in streaming video VLMs through causal temporal reduction and online quantized memory, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video VLMs face fundamental constraints of causality (no future frame access) and accumulation (unbounded token growth), but existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Causal Temporal Reduction imposes fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, reducing prefill cost; 2) Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them to keep active kv-cache bounded.

Result: Achieves 15.7× kv-cache compression, 1.2× lower peak memory, and 2× faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Maintains state-of-the-art accuracy with 63.8% on offline benchmarks and 55.8%/3.7 on RVS.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach provides practical benefits for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth, highlighting the importance of addressing both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

### [41] [Efficient Few-shot Identity Preserving Attribute Editing for 3D-aware Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18287)
*Vishal Vinod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for 3D-aware identity-preserving face editing using few-shot learning to find latent space directions that enable photorealistic attribute modifications while maintaining view consistency across multiple poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identity-preserving 3D face editing is challenging due to view consistency requirements and the trade-off between editability at low resolution versus inflexibility at high resolution. Current methods need large labeled datasets and struggle with 3D consistency.

Method: Leverages 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to perform few-shot identity-preserving attribute editing. Uses just 10 or fewer labeled images to estimate edit directions in latent space, and employs synthetic images from existing datasets with masks.

Result: The method successfully enables 3D-aware attribute editing with minimal labeled data, demonstrating linearity of edits through sequential editing and continuous style manifolds for face aging.

Conclusion: The approach alleviates constraints in 3D face editing by identifying latent space directions for photorealistic edits, enabling efficient few-shot identity-preserving attribute editing for 3D-aware generative models.

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

TL;DR: A training-free framework that enhances pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation models by integrating stereo vision guidance to resolve scale ambiguities and achieve accurate metric depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based monocular depth estimation methods excel at relative depth but struggle with absolute metric depth due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios.

Method: Reframes depth estimation as an inverse problem using pretrained latent diffusion models conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric constraints to learn scale and shift parameters for accurate depth recovery.

Result: The approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios with translucent and specular surfaces.

Conclusion: The training-free solution effectively integrates into existing frameworks and generalizes well across diverse environments without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

*Lehan Wang,Yi Qin,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-RwR is a multimodal medical reasoning framework that enhances MLLMs by actively retrieving external knowledge during diagnosis, using reinforcement learning and confidence-driven re-retrieval to improve accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge, leading to hallucinations and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Current Agentic RAG methods are limited to unimodal LLMs and neglect visual information.

Method: Proposes Med-RwR framework with two-stage reinforcement learning strategy that stimulates models to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for retrieval. Includes Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) for test-time scaling when low confidence is detected.

Result: Significant improvements over baseline models on various medical benchmarks, with 8.8% performance gain on EchoCardiography Benchmark despite training data scarcity. Demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains.

Conclusion: Med-RwR effectively enhances reasoning capabilities through external knowledge integration, proving the value of multimodal retrieval-augmented generation in medical applications for more reliable diagnosis.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how image resolution affects multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biomedical imaging, finding that native-resolution training/inference significantly improves performance, resolution misalignment degrades performance, and mixed-resolution training effectively balances computational constraints with performance requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are designed for low-resolution general-purpose images, risking critical information loss in biomedical applications where high-resolution imaging is fundamental to research and medicine.

Method: The study investigates image resolution effects on MLLM performance through native-resolution training/inference experiments, examines resolution misalignment impacts, and develops mixed-resolution training approaches.

Result: Native-resolution training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple biomedical tasks, resolution misalignment severely degrades performance, and mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment while balancing computational constraints.

Conclusion: The paper recommends prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: OmniNWM is a panoramic navigation world model that addresses state, action, and reward dimensions in autonomous driving through unified panoramic video generation, precise trajectory control, and occupancy-based reward computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving world models have limitations in state modalities, sequence length, action precision, and reward awareness. The paper aims to overcome these restrictions by developing a comprehensive framework that handles all three core dimensions effectively.

Method: Uses panoramic video generation for RGB, semantics, depth, and 3D occupancy; employs normalized Plucker ray-map representation for precise trajectory control; implements rule-based dense rewards derived from generated 3D occupancy for driving compliance and safety.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability. Provides a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Conclusion: OmniNWM successfully addresses the three core dimensions of autonomous driving world models within a unified framework, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics and enabling effective closed-loop evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

TL;DR: ATED is a training-free ensemble method that reduces object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by dynamically weighting predictions from multiple models during inference based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination (describing nonexistent objects), and existing solutions have limitations in scalability, adaptability, and model independence.

Method: Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED) - a token-level ensemble framework that aggregates predictions from multiple LVLMs using uncertainty-based weights and integrates diverse decoding paths.

Result: ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on hallucination detection benchmarks, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensembling is a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

### [47] [Enhancing Few-Shot Classification of Benchmark and Disaster Imagery with ATTBHFA-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18326)
*Gao Yu Lee,Tanmoy Dam,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Daniel Puiu Poenar,Vu Duong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATTBHFA-Net uses Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distance to improve few-shot learning for disaster image classification, addressing data scarcity and high intra-class variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster visual recognition faces challenges due to limited data collection and high intra-class variation. Current FSL methods using generic datasets are ineffective for disaster imagery with its unique characteristics.

Method: Proposes ATTBHFA-Net that combines Bhattacharyya coefficient (for inter-class separability) and Hellinger distance (for same-class alignment) to aggregate feature probability distributions. Uses a novel contrastive loss based on these metrics.

Result: Superior performance on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets, demonstrating better effectiveness and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The distribution-based approach using Bhattacharyya-Hellinger metrics significantly improves FSL performance for disaster image classification, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and classification challenges.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The comprehensive pipeline successfully addresses street view extrapolation challenges by combining geometric modeling with generative priors, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

TL;DR: A generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that uses web-crawled face data and self-supervised tasks, achieving comparable performance to SOTA models on facial downstream tasks and enabling various face editing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on large-scale pre-training models for facial knowledge compared to natural images, with current approaches relying on manually annotated datasets that are labor-intensive and have limited scalability.

Method: Leverages web-crawled face data with texts and images, uses self-supervised pre-training tasks (masked image/language modeling and image-text matching), and employs image-text matching loss during generation for controllable image/text generation.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models on facial downstream tasks like attribution classification and expression recognition, and enables various face editing tasks including attribute editing, expression manipulation, and inpainting.

Conclusion: The proposed generative pre-training approach effectively learns facial knowledge from web-scale data without manual annotation, demonstrating strong performance on downstream tasks and broad applicability to face editing applications.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

*Xinsheng Wang,Shanmin Pang,Jihua Zhu,Zhongyu Li,Zhiqiang Tian,Yaochen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two strategies to optimize the visual space for zero-shot learning: visual prototype-based method and intermediate embedding space optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot learning models use visual space with discrete instance distributions that make data structure unremarkable. Optimizing visual space is crucial for more effective semantic vector embedding.

Method: Two strategies: 1) Visual prototype-based method that learns a prototype for each visual class to represent classes instead of discrete features; 2) Intermediate embedding space optimization using a multilayer perceptron framework to make visual data structure more distinctive.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that optimizing visual space benefits zero-shot learning, with the prototype-based method achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing the visual space is beneficial for zero-shot learning, and the proposed prototype-based method sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: AV-Master is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Question Answering that dynamically models temporal and modality dimensions to better extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes with redundant content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA methods lack flexibility in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, limiting their reasoning capability in complex scenarios where models need to focus on question-relevant information.

Method: Proposes dynamic adaptive focus sampling for temporal dimension to progressively focus on relevant segments, preference-aware strategy for modality dimension to selectively activate critical features, and dual-path contrastive loss for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on four large-scale benchmarks, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AV-Master effectively addresses limitations in temporal sampling and modality awareness through dynamic modeling, enhancing reasoning capability in complex audio-visual scenarios.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRO is a new preference learning framework for text-to-image diffusion models that addresses limitations of DPO methods by using inverse reinforcement learning and combining offline demonstrations with online negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods struggle with accurately estimating image probabilities due to sigmoid function non-linearity and limited diversity in offline datasets, motivating a more effective preference learning approach.

Method: Diffusion-DRO casts preference learning as a ranking problem using inverse reinforcement learning, removes dependency on reward models, simplifies training to denoising formulation, and integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across challenging prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO provides an effective framework for aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by overcoming key limitations of prior methods through its ranking-based approach and hybrid data strategy.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: GroupHOI is a framework for Human-Object Interaction Detection that models collective behaviors by grouping humans and objects based on geometric proximity and semantic similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI-DET methods focus on pairwise relationships but overlook that real-world interactions often emerge from collective behaviors involving multiple humans and objects engaging in joint activities.

Method: Proposes GroupHOI framework that groups humans and objects using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features, computes soft correspondence via self-attention within groups, and enhances transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task.

Conclusion: GroupHOI effectively models collective behaviors in human-object interactions by considering geometric proximity and semantic similarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks including higher-order interaction tasks.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

Motivation: Existing black-box attacks require multiple queries and are impractical for real-world scenarios, especially for Video-LLMs. No video-domain attacks directly leverage feature maps to shift clean-video feature space.

Method: Utilizes information extracted from DNNs to alter the feature space of clean videos directly, performing zero-query attacks by exploiting DNN-extracted information without iterative interaction.

Result: Achieves >70% attack success rate against traditional video classifiers without queries, can bypass Video-LLM recognition through feature map transferability, and generates high-quality adversarial videos with excellent SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency metrics.

Conclusion: FeatureFool demonstrates an efficient, unprecedented zero-query attack approach in the video domain that is stealthy, practical, and scalable to Video-LLMs while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

### [55] [Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment for Image Complexity Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18377)
*Yuqing Luo,Yixiao Li,Jiang Liu,Jun Fu,Hadi Amirpour,Guanghui Yue,Baoquan Zhao,Padraig Corcoran,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CM-SSA, a cross-modal scene semantic alignment method for image complexity assessment that leverages text prompts to enhance complexity predictions by aligning visual and semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICA methods rely on single visual modality features which are insufficient to capture perceived representations related to image complexity. Cross-modal scene semantic information has shown promise in perceptual understanding tasks but hasn't been explored for ICA.

Method: CM-SSA consists of two branches: a complexity regression branch that estimates image complexity levels, and a scene semantic alignment branch that aligns images with corresponding text prompts through pair-wise learning to leverage rich scene semantic information.

Result: Extensive experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Leveraging cross-modal scene semantic alignment enhances ICA performance and makes complexity predictions more consistent with subjective human perception.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

### [56] [S2AP: Score-space Sharpness Minimization for Adversarial Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18381)
*Giorgio Piras,Qi Zhao,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Christian Wressnegger,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2AP is a novel adversarial pruning method that uses score-space sharpness minimization to stabilize mask selection and improve robustness by perturbing importance scores during mask search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial pruning methods suffer from unstable mask selection due to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape when optimizing in score space, which reduces their robustness.

Method: Proposes Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP) that introduces score-space sharpness minimization during mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels show S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizes mask selection, and improves robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Conclusion: S2AP successfully addresses the instability issue in adversarial pruning by incorporating score-space sharpness minimization, leading to more robust compressed neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

TL;DR: A novel local surface representation method using entropy of conformally-derived geometric features achieves 98.62% accuracy in distinguishing Alzheimer's patients from healthy controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease causes significant cortical atrophy, making geometric surface analysis valuable for diagnosis. The study aims to develop an automated and accurate diagnostic tool using cortical shape analysis.

Method: Used T1-weighted MRI from 160 ADNI participants. Reconstructed cortical surfaces with Freesurfer, computed geometric attributes (area distortion, conformal factor via Ricci flow, Gaussian curvature), applied Shannon entropy to create feature vectors, and trained multiple classifiers.

Result: The method was highly effective with MLP and Logistic Regression achieving 98.62% accuracy and F1 score. Statistical significance confirmed via paired Welch's t-test.

Conclusion: Entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful metric for cortical morphometry, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and clinical research.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

TL;DR: Proposes Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method for hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion using probabilistic tensor decomposition with hierarchical sparse priors to preserve spatial-spectral structures and model cross-dimensional correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods disrupt spatial-spectral structures through data vectorization/reshaping, impose rigid constraints, require extensive manual parameter tuning, and lack robustness against noise and degradation.

Method: Bayesian FCTN framework with hierarchical sparse prior connecting factor tensors, modeling intrinsic physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. Uses Variational Bayesian inference and Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy, strong robustness against noise and spatial degradation, and practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios with reduced manual parameter tuning.

Conclusion: BFCTN effectively addresses limitations of existing tensor decomposition methods by preserving spatial-spectral structures, modeling cross-dimensional correlations, and providing robust performance with automated parameter estimation.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

*Zhiwei Hao,Jianyuan Guo,Li Shen,Kai Han,Yehui Tang,Han Hu,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleNet enables efficient scaling of vision transformers by inserting additional layers with weight sharing and adapter modules, achieving better performance with fewer training epochs compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity and high cost of training larger vision transformer models from scratch, while maintaining performance improvements from model scaling.

Method: Insert additional layers into pretrained ViTs using layer-wise weight sharing and parallel adapter modules with adjustment parameters to maintain parameter efficiency and optimize shared weights.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, ScaleNet achieved 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch with a 2× depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, using only one-third of the training epochs. Also validated in object detection tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleNet provides a cost-effective solution for scaling ViT models efficiently, demonstrating significant potential for broader vision applications beyond image classification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

TL;DR: ImageGem is a dataset for studying generative models that understand individual user preferences, featuring real-world interaction data from 57K users with 242K customized LoRAs, 3M text prompts, and 5M generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge hindering the development of generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations.

Method: The dataset enables training better preference alignment models, investigating retrieval models and vision-language models on personalized tasks, and proposing an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in latent weight space.

Result: With user preference annotations from ImageGem, researchers were able to train better preference alignment models and demonstrate improved performance on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization by providing fine-grained individual user preference data at scale.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,

### [62] [Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437)
*Ji Du,Xin Wang,Fangwei Hao,Mingyang Yu,Chunyuan Chen,Jiesheng Wu,Bin Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a retrieval-based self-augmented paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection that generates pseudo-labels from unlabeled training data using prototype libraries and multi-view KNN retrieval, outperforming existing unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COD methods rely heavily on image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization, failing to leverage valuable dataset-level contextual information and requiring laborious manual annotations.

Method: RISE constructs prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using unlabeled training images, then uses a Clustering-then-Retrieval strategy with histogram-based filtering and cross-category retrieval to create high-confidence prototypes. Multi-View KNN Retrieval integrates results from diverse views to generate robust pseudo-masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods in camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed RISE framework effectively leverages dataset-level information without manual annotations, demonstrating that retrieval-based self-augmentation is a promising approach for camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: A new latent diffusion model generates high-quality 3D chest CT scans from anatomical masks using minimal GPU resources, enabling controlled synthesis of CT volumes with and without lung nodules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient method for generating realistic 3D chest CT scans that can be precisely controlled using anatomical masks, addressing the high computational cost of existing approaches.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model conditioned on 3D anatomical masks (lung and nodule regions) to synthesize volumetric CT images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm resolution on a single mid-range GPU.

Result: The model successfully generates diverse CT volumes with controlled anatomical features, but experiments show that conditioning only on nodule masks produces anatomically incorrect outputs, emphasizing the need for global lung structure information.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient tool for generating realistic CT data for AI model training and healthcare education, with precise control over anatomical features through mask conditioning.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

TL;DR: The paper proposes VFM-VAE, a direct integration approach for Vision Foundation Models in Latent Diffusion Models that bypasses distillation and achieves superior performance with 10x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation-based approaches for incorporating Vision Foundation Models into LDMs weaken robustness and cause semantic deviation under distribution shifts, highlighting the need for a more direct integration method.

Method: Proposes VFM-VAE with redesigned decoder using Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, plus a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy based on SE-CKNNA analysis.

Result: Achieves gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in 80 epochs (10x speedup) and 1.62 after 640 epochs, establishing direct VFM integration as superior paradigm.

Conclusion: Direct VFM integration through VFM-VAE with proper architectural redesign and training strategy outperforms distillation-based approaches in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Motivation: To address the challenging problem of reconstructing renderable 4D high dynamic range scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range videos with alternating exposures, which hasn't been studied before.

Method: A unified framework with two-stage optimization: first stage learns HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic space without camera poses, second stage transforms to world space and refines with camera poses, plus temporal luminance regularization for HDR consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on a new evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR successfully addresses the novel task of 4D HDR reconstruction from unposed monocular LDR videos and establishes superior performance over existing method adaptations.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Motivation: Existing vehicle make and model recognition methods struggle to adapt to newly released models, and CLIP's fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly finetuning.

Method: A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a textual feature database. Retrieved entries are combined with descriptions to form prompts for a language model to infer make and model.

Result: The proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline.

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced LM reasoning enables scalable vehicle make and model recognition for smart-city applications, avoiding large-scale retraining and allowing rapid updates through textual descriptions.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates successful implementation of "Greener AI" models for real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices, with object detection models being ideal for low-power, real-time applications.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

### [68] [RayPose: Ray Bundling Diffusion for Template Views in Unseen 6D Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18521)
*Junwen Huang,Shishir Reddy Vutukur,Peter KT Yu,Nassir Navab,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion transformer architecture that reformulates template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, learning to align viewing directions from posed templates with non-posed query images to improve pose prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template-based object pose pipelines often fail when retrieving incorrect templates, leading to inaccurate pose predictions. The authors aim to address this limitation by developing a more robust approach.

Method: The method uses a diffusion transformer architecture that reformulates pose estimation as ray alignment. It reparameterizes object rotation using object-centered camera rays and models translation through dense translation offsets. A coarse-to-fine training strategy with narrowed template sampling is employed.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed ray alignment formulation combined with diffusion transformers provides an effective solution for template-based object pose estimation, overcoming limitations of traditional template retrieval approaches.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

*Dušan Malić,Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger,Alexander Prutsch,Wei Lin,Samuel Schulter,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor that addresses geometric shortcuts in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the RoboSense 2025 Track 3 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR detectors suffer from geometric shortcuts where models rely on absolute object positions rather than shape/appearance characteristics, limiting generalization across different sensor placements.

Method: Uses GBlobs as local point cloud feature descriptors instead of conventional global features (absolute coordinates) to force the network to learn object-centric representations rather than position-dependent features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under various sensor placements, demonstrating exceptional generalization capability.

Conclusion: GBlobs effectively circumvent geometric shortcuts in LiDAR detection, enabling robust object-centric learning that significantly improves model generalization across diverse LiDAR configurations.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Occluded nuScenes Dataset, an extension of nuScenes benchmark with controlled, parameterized sensor occlusions for cameras, radar, and LiDAR to enable systematic evaluation of perception models under adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving datasets lack controlled, parameterized, and reproducible sensor degradations, limiting systematic evaluation of perception and fusion architectures under well-defined adverse conditions like sensor failures and environmental occlusions.

Method: Extended nuScenes benchmark with: camera modality - full and mini versions with four occlusion types (two adapted, two new); radar and LiDAR - parameterized occlusion scripts implementing three degradation types each for flexible and repeatable data generation.

Result: Created the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, supporting consistent evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.

Conclusion: This resource advances research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving by enabling systematic testing under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

*Zhenxing Zhang,Jiayan Teng,Zhuoyi Yang,Tiankun Cao,Cheng Wang,Xiaotao Gu,Jie Tang,Dan Guo,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kaleido is a subject-to-video generation framework that improves multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement in video synthesis from multiple reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing S2V generation models struggle with maintaining multi-subject consistency and handling background disentanglement, leading to lower reference fidelity and semantic drift when using multiple reference images.

Method: Proposes a dedicated data construction pipeline with low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, plus Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) for stable multi-image integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization across numerous benchmarks.

Conclusion: Kaleido represents an advance in S2V generation by effectively addressing multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement challenges.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

*Yongmin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CovMatch is a scalable multimodal dataset distillation framework that aligns cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions, enabling joint optimization of both image and text encoders for improved cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending dataset distillation to multimodal contrastive learning faces challenges in learning cross-modal alignment and managing computational costs. Prior approaches that freeze text encoders severely limit semantic alignment and become performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes CovMatch framework that aligns cross-covariance between real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior methods, it enables joint optimization of both image and text encoders.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods on Flickr30K and COCO datasets, achieving up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic image-text pairs.

Conclusion: CovMatch provides a scalable solution for multimodal dataset distillation that enables joint encoder optimization, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

*Zhangquan Chen,Manyuan Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Xufang Luo,Mingze Sun,Zihao Pan,Yan Feng,Peng Pei,Xunliang Cai,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DThinker is a framework that enables 3D spatial reasoning from limited 2D views without requiring 3D prior inputs or explicitly labeled 3D training data, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views, as existing methods rely on text or 2D visual cues which have limited representational capacity for 3D spatial imagination tasks.

Method: Two-stage training: first supervised training to align 3D latent representations from VLM reasoning with a 3D foundation model (VGGT), then optimization of the entire reasoning trajectory based on outcome signals to refine 3D mentaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning and enables 3D mentaling during reasoning without 3D prior input or explicit 3D training data.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

*Sheida Rahnamai Kordasiabi,Damian Dalle Nogare,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ε-Seg is a hierarchical variational autoencoder method for semantic segmentation of electron microscopy images that achieves competitive results with extremely sparse labels (0.05% or less) using center-region masking, contrastive learning, and clustering-free prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of EM images is challenging due to the overwhelming complexity of biological structures, and existing methods struggle with limited labeled data.

Method: Uses hierarchical VAEs with center-region masking for robust embeddings, sparse label contrastive learning and GMM prior for latent space clustering, and MLP segmentation head for direct label prediction instead of clustering.

Result: Achieves competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation on 2 dense EM datasets and fluorescence microscopy data, working effectively with very limited training labels.

Conclusion: ε-Seg enables effective semantic segmentation of complex biological images with extremely sparse supervision, making it practical for real-world applications where labeling is expensive.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ), a novel matrix quantization method that uses binary quadratic expressions instead of linear combinations, achieving superior memory efficiency and accuracy in matrix compression and neural network quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional first-order quantization methods (uniform quantization, binary coding) use linear combinations of binary bases, which have limited expressive power. BQQ aims to leverage the superior expressive capability of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining compact data formats.

Method: BQQ uses binary quadratic expressions for matrix approximation rather than linear combinations. The method is validated through matrix compression benchmarks and post-training quantization (PTQ) on Vision Transformer models, without relying on PTQ-specific optimizations.

Result: BQQ consistently achieves better trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods. In PTQ experiments, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.2% (calibration-based) and 59.1% (data-free) on ImageNet with 2-bit quantization equivalent.

Conclusion: Binary quadratic expressions are surprisingly effective for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression, demonstrating superior performance over conventional first-order quantization approaches while maintaining compact data representation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an interactive satellite image change detection method using active learning with a novel invertible network for data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve satellite image change detection by interactively querying users for labels and dynamically updating the model, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data.

Method: Uses an iterative active learning framework with a question-and-answer model that queries users about image labels. Features a novel invertible network that maps data to latent spaces for linear augmentation transformations, then maps back to input space for model retraining.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to related work in satellite image change detection.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive framework with invertible network augmentation effectively improves change detection accuracy through active learning.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

*Hanif Rasyidi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes factors affecting end-to-end deep learning for historical writer identification, finding most models struggle with generalization in realistic document-level settings, but identifies one setup that matches top performance despite simpler design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical writer identification remains challenging due to handwriting diversity, document degradation, and limited labeled samples. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features but end-to-end approaches aim to automate feature learning directly from images.

Method: Explored combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation.

Result: Most configurations performed poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. However, one end-to-end setup achieved results comparable to top-performing systems.

Conclusion: The findings highlight key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and provide insights into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where test writers are not in training data.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

TL;DR: MoGA introduces a learnable token router for efficient sparse attention in Diffusion Transformers, enabling minute-long 480p video generation by overcoming quadratic attention scaling issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation with DiTs is limited by quadratic attention scaling, and existing sparse methods have constrained accuracy-efficiency trade-offs due to blockwise estimation.

Method: Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) uses a lightweight learnable token router for precise token matching without blockwise estimation, enabling semantic-aware routing and seamless integration with modern attention stacks.

Result: The approach produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps with a context length of ~580k, validated through comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MoGA provides an effective solution for efficient long-range interactions in video generation, overcoming attention scaling bottlenecks through semantic-aware sparse attention.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: UniGenBench++ is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-image generation models, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by providing diverse multilingual prompts and fine-grained semantic assessment across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks lack diversity in prompt scenarios, multilingual support, and fine-grained evaluation capabilities, limiting their real-world applicability and comprehensive assessment of model performance.

Method: Created UniGenBench++ with 600 prompts organized hierarchically across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes, with English and Chinese versions in short/long forms. Used Gemini-2.5-Pro MLLM for reliable benchmark construction and developed an offline evaluation model for community use.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of T2I models across 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, revealing strengths and weaknesses of various open- and closed-source models through comprehensive testing.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++ provides a unified, multilingual, and fine-grained semantic assessment framework that addresses key limitations in existing T2I evaluation benchmarks, facilitating more comprehensive model evaluation and community adoption.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

*Yiqi Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L is a vision-centric contrastive learning framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer, rendering all inputs as images to eliminate the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive vision-language models like CLIP struggle with complex web documents where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form, requiring better handling of multimodal web data.

Method: VC2L uses a snippet-level contrastive learning objective to align consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging document coherence without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. All inputs are rendered as images and processed through a single vision transformer.

Result: VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both proposed benchmarks (AnyCIR, SeqCIR, CSR) and established datasets like M-BEIR and MTEB.

Conclusion: Multimodal web data is a valuable training resource for contrastive learning, and a unified vision-centric approach is scalable and effective for multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuberculosis is a critical global health issue, especially in resource-limited areas where early detection is vital but skilled radiologists are scarce, creating need for AI-driven screening tools.

Method: Proposed a teacher-student framework that integrates two supervised heads and a self-supervised head to enhance both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays.

Result: Achieved 98.85% accuracy for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and 90.09% macro-F1 score for multilabel symptom detection, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates promise for clinical deployment as explainability assessments show it bases predictions on relevant anatomical features, suitable for screening and triage settings.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model

### [82] [A Renaissance of Explicit Motion Information Mining from Transformers for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18705)
*Peiqin Zhuang,Lei Bai,Yichao Wu,Ding Liang,Luping Zhou,Yali Wang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EMIM, a module that integrates cost volume-style motion modeling into transformers to improve action recognition performance on motion-sensitive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods dominate action recognition but perform poorly on motion-sensitive datasets due to lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Cost volumes in traditional action recognition have powerful motion modeling capacities similar to self-attention affinity matrices.

Method: Proposes Explicit Motion Information Mining (EMIM) module that constructs affinity matrix in cost volume style by sampling key candidate tokens from query-based neighboring area in next frame using sliding window. The affinity matrix is used for both contextual aggregation and motion feature extraction.

Result: Validated on four datasets, performs better than state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets Something-Something V1 & V2.

Conclusion: Integrating cost volume-style motion modeling into transformers through EMIM effectively improves motion modeling capacities and achieves superior performance on motion-sensitive action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

*Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Zhengqiang Zhang,Shihao Wang,Tianhe Wu,Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP²O-SR is a framework that optimizes real-world image super-resolution models using perceptual preferences without human annotations, leveraging hybrid quality assessment rewards and hierarchical preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the perceptual quality range introduced by T2I diffusion models' stochasticity for improving Real-ISR performance, while avoiding costly human annotation requirements.

Method: Constructs hybrid reward signals combining full-reference and no-reference IQA models, uses multiple preference pairs from same-model outputs, and implements hierarchical preference optimization with adaptive weighting based on reward gaps and diversity.

Result: Significantly improves perceptual quality across diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: DP²O-SR effectively aligns generative models with perceptual preferences through automated optimization, with optimal selection strategies depending on model capacity and hierarchical weighting enabling efficient learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

*Changkun Liu,Bin Tan,Zeran Ke,Shangzhan Zhang,Jiachen Liu,Ming Qian,Nan Xue,Yujun Shen,Tristan Braud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLANA3R is a pose-free framework for metric 3D reconstruction from unposed two-view images using planar primitives, trained without explicit plane supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting geometric regularities with compact planar representations, overcoming the need for 3D plane annotations in prior methods.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers to extract sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting with gradients propagated through rendered depth and normal maps.

Result: Validated on multiple indoor datasets with strong generalization to out-of-domain environments, achieving good performance in 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, pose estimation, and plane segmentation.

Conclusion: PLANA3R enables scalable planar 3D reconstruction without explicit plane supervision, demonstrating robust performance across diverse indoor scene tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAR (Grasp Any Region) is a region-level multimodal LLM that addresses limitations in fine-grained visual understanding by leveraging global contexts and modeling interactions between multiple regions, achieving advanced compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with dense scenes requiring fine-grained analysis and object inter-relationships. Previous region-level approaches understand regions in isolation without global context.

Method: Uses RoI-aligned feature replay technique to support precise perception with global contexts, model interactions between multiple prompts, and achieve compositional reasoning about any region.

Result: GAR-1B outperforms DAM-3B by +4.5 on DLC-Bench, surpasses InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA, and GAR-8B outperforms VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ in zero-shot video transfer.

Conclusion: GAR enables comprehensive region-level visual understanding with global context awareness, multi-region interaction modeling, and strong transfer capabilities to video domains.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel KV cache compression framework for autoregressive image generation that reduces memory usage by 5× and speeds up throughput by 6.6× with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro have high memory and computational costs due to large numbers of visual tokens, and KV cache compression remains largely unexplored for image generation compared to language modeling.

Method: Identifies spatial locality and emergent semantic sink attention phenomena, then compresses KV cache by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two types: spatial-locality heads maintain short recent token windows, while semantic-sink heads preserve compact sets of highly-attended tokens.

Result: Achieves 5× reduction in memory usage and 6.6× speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss.

Conclusion: Enables highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware by effectively compressing KV cache while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IF-VidCap is a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning that assesses instruction-following capabilities, revealing that while proprietary models still lead, open-source models are catching up and dense captioning specialists underperform on complex instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video captioning benchmarks focus on descriptive comprehensiveness but overlook instruction-following capabilities, which are crucial for practical applications where users need specific types of captions rather than exhaustive descriptions.

Method: Created IF-VidCap benchmark with 1,400 high-quality samples and a systematic framework that evaluates captions on format correctness and content correctness dimensions. Evaluated over 20 prominent models.

Result: Proprietary models still dominate but the performance gap is closing, with top open-source solutions achieving near-parity. Dense captioning specialized models underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions.

Conclusion: Future work should advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity simultaneously, as specialized dense captioning models are insufficient for complex instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

*Hao Wang,Ying Zhou,Haoyu Zhao,Rui Wang,Qiang Hu,Xing Zhang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColIAGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for colonoscopy by addressing illumination variations through enhanced appearance and geometry modeling, achieving better rendering quality and geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard 3DGS assumes static illumination, which doesn't work well in colonoscopy where light sources and cameras move, causing photometric variations that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes ColIAGS with Improved Appearance Modeling using two illumination attenuation factors, Improved Geometry Modeling with high-dimensional view embedding, and cosine embedding for implicit illumination attenuation.

Result: Achieves superior rendering fidelity and significantly reduces Depth MSE compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: ColIAGS enables dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction for colonoscopic scenes with dynamic illumination.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

TL;DR: SEAL introduces a hierarchical learning framework for Generalized Category Discovery that leverages natural hierarchical structures to improve classification of both known and unknown classes in partially labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches rely on single-level semantics or manually designed hierarchies, limiting their generalizability and scalability for categorizing unlabeled images from both known and unknown classes.

Method: Proposes SEAL with Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning that generates informative soft negatives using hierarchical similarity, and a Cross-Granularity Consistency module to align predictions across different granularity levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks (SSB, Oxford-Pet, Herbarium19) and demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses limitations of conventional contrastive learning by exploiting hierarchical structures, providing a scalable solution for Generalized Category Discovery.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heat island effects are worsening due to urbanization and climate change, but conventional ML models with limited data produce inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas.

Method: Fine-tuned geospatial foundation models using global unstructured data, established empirical ground truth by quantifying cooling effects from green spaces, and benchmarked against model predictions.

Result: Foundation models demonstrated strong generalization and accurate land surface temperature predictions under future climate scenarios, validated through simulated inpainting.

Conclusion: Geospatial foundation models offer a powerful approach for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions to build more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraGen is a novel video generation framework that enables efficient end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis (up to 4K) by addressing the computational bottleneck of attention mechanisms in existing diffusion transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (≤720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, making native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for training and inference.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture with global-local attention decomposition: local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and global attention branch for semantic consistency. Includes spatially compressed global modeling and hierarchical cross-window local attention to reduce computational costs while maintaining information flow.

Result: UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed UltraGen framework successfully addresses the computational challenges of high-resolution video generation, enabling efficient end-to-end native synthesis of high-quality videos up to 4K resolution.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

TL;DR: A novel "Rebellious Student" framework for hyperspectral anomaly detection that trains spatial and spectral branches to learn complementary features through intentional divergence rather than imitation, enabling parameter-free deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hyperspectral anomaly detection by integrating spectral and spatial cues through complementary feature learning, building on universal deployment methods that don't require per-scene retraining.

Method: Two-stage learning: (1) spectral enhancement network trained via reverse distillation for robust background representations, (2) spatial network (rebellious student) optimized using decorrelation losses to enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: The proposed complementary learning paradigm successfully enhances both spectral and spatial background features for parameter-free anomaly detection, demonstrating remarkable efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCLIP is a curriculum learning framework that progressively aligns CLIP's image encoder with LLM-based text embedders to handle long texts and multilingual inputs while preserving CLIP's original vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder has limitations: 77-token max length restricts long text processing, lacks multilingual support, and hampers fine-grained semantic understanding. Direct LLM replacement disrupts CLIP's vision-language alignment.

Method: Uses curriculum learning: 1) Knowledge distillation from CLIP text encoder to LLM embedder, 2) Image-text contrastive tuning with self-distillation regularization, 3) Instance semantic alignment and embedding structure alignment losses.

Result: Successfully aligns LLM-based embedder with CLIP image encoder while preserving original vision-language alignment, enabling long text processing and multilingual support without disrupting pre-trained knowledge.

Conclusion: ProCLIP provides an effective progressive alignment framework that overcomes CLIP's text limitations while maintaining its strong vision-language alignment capabilities.

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by
many papers, our work provides a new and more intuitive derivation of steerable

geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an

construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

TL;DR: SAM 2++ is a unified video tracking model that handles tracking at any granularity (masks, boxes, points) using task-specific prompts, unified decoder, and task-adaptive memory mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers are tailored to single tasks with custom-designed modules, limiting generalization and causing redundancy in model design and parameters.

Method: Designs task-specific prompts to encode various inputs into general embeddings, unified decoder for diverse outputs, task-adaptive memory mechanism for cross-granularity matching, and creates Tracking-Any-Granularity dataset.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified and robust tracking framework that can handle tracking at any granularity effectively.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

*Yujie Xing,Xiao Wang,Bin Wu,Hai Huang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M3Dphormer, a unified hierarchical mask framework for graph transformers that reveals the equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction, enabling flexible modeling of diverse node interactions through carefully designed masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph transformers rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. The authors aim to create a unified framework that can model diverse node interactions more flexibly.

Method: Proposed M3Dphormer with: 1) Unified hierarchical mask framework showing architecture-mask equivalence, 2) Three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks, 3) Mixture-of-Experts with bi-level expert routing for adaptive multi-level integration, 4) Dual attention computation switching between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: The unified hierarchical mask framework successfully addresses flexibility limitations in graph transformers, with M3Dphormer providing a scalable and effective solution that adaptively integrates multi-level interaction information through theoretically grounded mask designs.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

*Yubin Zheng,Pak-Hei Yeung,Jing Xia,Tianjie Ju,Peng Tang,Weidong Qiu,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDEAP is an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework that enhances CLIP's generalization in multi-domain FL scenarios through semantic-domain feature disentanglement, dual-prompt design, and text-visual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain shift and label heterogeneity issues in federated learning that hinder global model generalization, and leverage CLIP's zero-shot capabilities while preserving domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Three key components: (1) semantic and domain feature disentanglement using transformation networks, (2) dual-prompt design with global semantic and local domain prompts, (3) text-visual alignment under learned transformations for semantic and domain consistency.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate effectiveness in enhancing CLIP's generalization for federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Conclusion: FedDEAP successfully improves CLIP's generalization in federated multi-domain scenarios by balancing shared semantic information and local domain-specific knowledge through adaptive prompt tuning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeTok is a vision-centric text tokenization method that renders text as images and uses multimodal LLMs to interpret them, achieving comparable performance to subword tokenizers while using 4.43x fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use subword tokenization which fragments text and over-segments low-resource languages, creating long meaningless sequences and inflating computation. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, suggesting a more natural visual approach.

Method: SeeTok renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training.

Result: Across three language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43x fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy.

Conclusion: SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading and represents a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios but struggle with dynamic 3D scenarios where both observers and objects move simultaneously, highlighting the need for better dynamic spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created DSI-Bench with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns, using spatially and temporally symmetric designs to reduce biases and systematically evaluate motion reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models showed key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench provides valuable insights for developing models with dynamic spatial intelligence, revealing current limitations and guiding future improvements in understanding dynamic 3D scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with

*Al Kari*

TL;DR: CAST is a novel framework that transfers LoRA-encoded behaviors between different LLM architectures by learning nonlinear mappings between their activation manifolds, enabling zero-shot transfer without task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome architectural lock-in where valuable task-specific behaviors learned through LoRA fine-tuning are trapped within source model architectures, as existing weight-space transfer methods are brittle and indirect.

Method: Learns lightweight bidirectional projection heads that translate target model activations into source model's latent space, applies frozen LoRA kernel, and projects back - trained on general text corpus without task-specific data.

Result: CAST achieves 85-95% performance of fully retrained LoRA on target models, outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques in transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral.

Conclusion: CAST establishes a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability by decoupling learned skills from source architecture through direct activation space transfer.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real chatbot deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, with most retrieval pipelines focusing on relevance while overlooking set-level diversity and confounds like context length and exemplar order.

Method: Proposed diversity-aware retrieval framework that selects in-context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, integrated with standard LLM decoders. Evaluation enforces budget-matched prompts and randomized positions.

Result: Achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines on MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate latency.

Conclusion: The study isolates and validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval, offering a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget-constrained multi-turn intent systems.

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting agentic data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale, creating a bottleneck for developing tool-using LLM agents.

Method: Modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records including task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces, with JSON-schema validation and judge-based filtering.

Result: The framework generates machine-parseable, semantically aligned agentic records that support both multi-task and multi-turn interactions, covering the full spectrum of tool-use competencies.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual data collection, advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to
decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.
Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured
interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,
argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting
such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only
LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes
generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records
spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural
language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic
and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment
across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support
for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the
construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use
competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates
constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based
filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the
prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable
pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible,
LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of
agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems use predefined structures or simple voting/debate methods that suppress correct but less dominant contributions, and current graph-based approaches focus only on agent performance while neglecting interaction quality.

Method: Proposes a verbal reinforcement learning algorithm with dynamic collaboration structure construction, action spaces, and feedback mechanisms that evaluate communication robustness and coherence throughout debates, with final decisions via majority voting.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-agent prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks across mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting tasks.

Conclusion: Effective agent communication and debating quality are crucial for multi-agent reasoning, and the proposed reinforcement learning approach successfully enhances collective intelligence through dynamic, quality-aware collaboration structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time, addressing distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios with conflicting facts.

Method: Proposes nine axioms (A1-A9) including event as fixation act, causal order via happens-before, executable ontology via declarative dataflow, models as epistemic filters, and presumption of truth. Implements in BSL language within boldsea workflow engine.

Result: Developed a formal framework ensuring monotonicity of history, acyclicity of causality, and traceability. Demonstrated practical applicability through boldsea system implementation.

Conclusion: The subject-event ontology provides a robust foundation for modeling distributed systems without global time, enabling deterministic execution and handling multiperspectivity through model-based validation and causal chain construction.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs incur substantial run-time costs in agentic workflows with lengthy prompts and rich data streams, creating a need for cost reduction without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping to prune low-information tokens from prompts, plus n-gram abbreviation for textual patterns and uniform quantization for numerical data.

Result: Reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark datasets like TAT-QA and FinQA, with minimal accuracy drop (less than 5% for Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1-Mini).

Conclusion: CompactPrompt enables leaner generative AI pipelines by providing substantial cost savings while preserving output quality, with visualization tools for compression decisions and cost-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time

TL;DR: Planned diffusion is a hybrid text generation method that combines autoregressive planning with parallel diffusion generation to achieve better speed-quality trade-offs than pure autoregressive or diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between generation speed and output quality in large language model inference, where autoregressive models are slow but high-quality while diffusion models are fast but need many iterations for comparable quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Create a short autoregressive plan that breaks output into smaller independent spans, 2) Generate these spans simultaneously using diffusion.

Result: Achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off on AlpacaEval with 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87% to 5.4% drop in win rate. Planning mechanism is minimal and reliable with simple runtime controls.

Conclusion: Planned diffusion expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation through its hybrid approach.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Motivation: Current LLM methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally, highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize performance and ensure robustness.

Method: Introduces the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework - a strategy fusion approach that creates balanced solutions through seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Uses LLMs as intelligent integrators rather than just evaluators.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluations show SMaRT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics across reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making benchmarks.

Conclusion: SMaRT redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing self-refining methodologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent
integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive
empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential
decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution
quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines
LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy
calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIEV, a dialectics-based framework that evaluates LLM reasoning as a dynamic process of idea evolution rather than just correctness of final answers, revealing significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations focus on correct standalone answers but reveal little about the reasoning process. The authors argue reasoning should be viewed as a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact and evolve, not just a static chain of steps.

Method: The paper presents SIEV, a structured framework based on dialectics (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) that evaluates how LLMs reach conclusions, including their ability to resolve tension, integrate ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning.

Result: SIEV uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks. GPT-5-chat loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM, showing conventional benchmarks may overestimate reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning, revealing limitations that traditional evaluations miss.

Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current
evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but
correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this
work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of
steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into
deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established
philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a
structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.
Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model
reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate
distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers
significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated
benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses
over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings
highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach
enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM
reasoning.

Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) have deployment advantages but lag behind larger models in accuracy for complex tasks. Supervised fine-tuning requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and optimization.

Method: PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies to directly reduce generalization gaps, using coordinated operations for streamlined data augmentation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The PaDA-Agent approach effectively bridges the performance gap for SLMs through pattern-guided data augmentation, offering a more efficient alternative to manual data preparation for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

*Antonio-Gabriel Chacón Menke,Phan Xuan Tan,Eiji Kamioka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A sentence-level labeled dataset for activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning, enabling detection and steering of safety concerns in model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current textual reasoning analysis methods can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by models hiding unsafe reasoning, highlighting the need for activation-level safety monitoring.

Method: Created a dataset with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors (expression of safety concerns, speculation on user intent) and used it to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors in model activations.

Result: Demonstrated the dataset's utility by extracting representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations.

Conclusion: Activation-level techniques show potential for improving safety oversight on reasoning by enabling precise identification of when specific safety behaviors occur within reasoning chains.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

*Man-Lin Chu,Lucian Terhorst,Kadin Reed,Tom Ni,Weiwei Chen,Rongyu Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework for consumer decision-making that models complex human behavior and social dynamics without predefined rules, enabling marketers to test strategies before real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-event analyses and rule-based agent-based models fail to capture the complexity of human behavior and social interactions in consumer decision-making, leading to underperforming marketing campaigns.

Method: Multi-agent simulation framework powered by large language models where generative agents interact, express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions in a sandbox environment without predefined rules.

Result: The system delivers actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns in price-discount marketing scenarios that conventional methods cannot capture.

Conclusion: This approach provides marketers with a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering campaign failure risks.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,
express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without
predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers
actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns
beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a
scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on
time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming
campaigns.

*Yihong Dong,Zhaoyu Ma,Xue Jiang,Zhiyuan Fan,Jiaru Qian,Yongmin Li,Jianha Xiao,Zhi Jin,Rongyu Cao,Binhua Li,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Saber is a training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion language models that improves code generation by adaptively accelerating inference while maintaining quality through backtracking mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models have advantages in parallel generation but suffer from a critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality in code generation tasks, where reducing sampling steps causes performance collapse.

Method: Saber uses adaptive acceleration (speeding up as more code context is established) and backtracking enhanced remasking (reversing generated tokens when needed) without requiring additional training.

Result: Saber achieves average 1.9% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy and 251.4% inference speedup over mainstream DLM sampling methods on multiple code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work significantly narrows the performance gap between diffusion language models and autoregressive models in code generation by leveraging DLM's inherent advantages.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench is a benchmark for evaluating how tool-augmented language model agents adapt to mid-dialogue goal changes in enterprise settings, using four metrics to measure effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, and adaptation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use, but real-world multi-turn interactions often involve goal changes that require dynamic adaptation.

Method: The benchmark comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows, evaluated through four metrics: Task Success Rate, Tool Use Efficiency, Tool Call Redundancy Rate, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time.

Result: Evaluation of frontier models revealed sharp contrasts: GPT-4o achieved 92.2% recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapsed to 48.6%, and retail tasks showed near perfect parameter validity but redundancy rates above 80%, indicating major inefficiencies.

Conclusion: High raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential for evaluating agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

*Soumya Rani Samineni,Durgesh Kalwar,Vardaan Gangal,Siddhant Bhambri,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR-based post-training improves trace coherence in LLM reasoning but doesn't guarantee final answer correctness, challenging claims about RL improving reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods treat all tokens uniformly and claim improved reasoning traces based on final answer metrics, but don't examine intermediate token effects or distinguish between trace coherence and validity.

Method: Used GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on GSM8K dataset, introducing trace coherence - a First-Order Logic measure to evaluate consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in traces.

Result: RL post-training improves trace coherence, especially on problems where base model fails but RL model succeeds. However, improved coherence doesn't guarantee valid solutions or correct final answers.

Conclusion: Claims about RL improving reasoning must be carefully examined as improved trace coherence doesn't necessarily translate to valid mathematical proofs or correct solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning
tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,
however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for
token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on
final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL
post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our
investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which
are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup
using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We
introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture
the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We
distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former
implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of
errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence
with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the
RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without
necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial
distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee
final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL
must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,
which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

TL;DR: A quantifiable framework for AGI is proposed, defining it as matching human cognitive versatility. Current AI models show jagged profiles with strengths in knowledge domains but critical deficits in foundational cognition like long-term memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a concrete definition for AGI obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition, necessitating a quantifiable framework.

Method: Ground methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, dissect intelligence into 10 cognitive domains, and adapt human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems.

Result: Application reveals highly "jagged" cognitive profiles in contemporary models. GPT-4 scores 27% and GPT-5 scores 58% on the AGI scale, showing rapid progress but substantial remaining gaps.

Conclusion: The framework concretely quantifies both rapid AI progress and the substantial gap remaining before achieving AGI, highlighting critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

*Xiaohan Qin,Xiaoxing Wang,Ning Liao,Cancheng Zhang,Xiangdong Zhang,Mingquan Feng,Jingzhi Wang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ssToken is a token-level data selection method for LLM fine-tuning that uses self-modulated loss differences and semantic-aware attention metrics to select tokens adaptively without needing a reference model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level selection methods require additional reference models and rely solely on loss information, which fails to preserve semantically important tokens not favored by loss-based metrics.

Method: ssToken uses history models to compute per-token loss differences as self-modulated signals, and introduces attention-based token importance estimation to provide complementary semantic information for filtering.

Result: Both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, and their integration in ssToken achieves synergistic gains and surpasses prior token-level selection methods.

Conclusion: ssToken delivers performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency across different model families and scales, addressing key limitations of existing token-level selection approaches.

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

### [118] [Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18254)
*Sion Weatherhead,Flora Salim,Aaron Belbasis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM 'reflection' is not functionally equivalent to human reasoning - models show poor self-correction on open-ended tasks, often repeating the same constraint violations despite reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLM 'reflection' is functionally equivalent to human reflective reasoning, particularly on open-ended tasks where self-correction matters more than in closed-ended tasks with clear correctness signals.

Method: Tested eight frontier models on producing valid scientific test items, then revising after self-critique. Analyzed first-pass performance and reflection gains on this open-ended but rule-constrained task.

Result: Poor first-pass performance (often 0/4 valid items, mean ≈1), modest reflection gains (also ≈1). Models frequently repeated same constraint violations, suggesting gains come from chance rather than principled error detection and repair.

Conclusion: Current LLM 'reflection' lacks active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints. Reliable performance requires external constraint enforcement until such mechanisms are built into models.

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Genesis is an agentic framework for attacking web agents using genetic algorithms and dynamic strategy discovery, outperforming existing methods across various web tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agent attack methods rely on manual strategies or static offline models, failing to capture behavioral patterns and generalize across environments. Continuous strategy discovery is needed for effective attacks.

Method: Three-module framework: Attacker generates adversarial injections using genetic algorithms with hybrid strategy representation; Scorer evaluates target agent responses; Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from logs and builds a growing strategy library.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines across various web tasks.

Conclusion: Genesis successfully addresses the limitations of existing web agent attack methods by enabling continuous strategy evolution and discovery, demonstrating superior performance in attacking LLM-based web agents.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

TL;DR: ShortcutBreaker is a unified feature-reconstruction framework for multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection that addresses identity shortcuts in Transformer-based models through a low-rank noisy bottleneck and global perturbation attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection aims to develop unified models across multiple classes to save computational resources, but existing Transformer-based approaches suffer from identity shortcuts that copy inputs to outputs, making it harder to distinguish normal from abnormal cases.

Method: Proposes two key innovations: 1) Low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) that projects high-dimensional features into low-rank latent space to prevent trivial identity reproduction, and 2) Global perturbation attention that leverages ViT's global modeling capability to prevent information shortcuts in decoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks: 99.8% AUROC on MVTec-AD, 98.9% on ViSA, 90.6% on Real-IAD, and 87.8% on Universal Medical, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across industrial and medical datasets.

Conclusion: ShortcutBreaker effectively addresses identity shortcut issues in multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection through theoretical and architectural innovations, demonstrating superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in complex decision-making, resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" while maintaining interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel
framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges
like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,
MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify
structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:
(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to
emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a
lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,
priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate
MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly
outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'
semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict
state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability.
This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in
complex decision-making.

### [123] [Heterogeneous Adversarial Play in Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18407)
*Manjie Xu,Xinyi Yang,Jiayu Zhan,Wei Liang,Chi Zhang,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) is an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework that enables asymmetric teacher-student co-evolution through minimax optimization, outperforming traditional self-play and static curriculum methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional symmetric self-play frameworks are inadequate for open-ended learning with inherent asymmetry, while human pedagogical systems demonstrate effective asymmetric instruction that needs to be operationalized in AI systems.

Method: HAP formalizes teacher-student interactions as minimax optimization, creating a bidirectional feedback system where instructors dynamically adjust task complexity based on real-time learner performance.

Result: Experimental validation shows HAP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art baselines while generating curricula that enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

Conclusion: The HAP framework successfully operationalizes asymmetric pedagogical mechanisms for autonomous curriculum synthesis, demonstrating superior learning outcomes compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

TL;DR: UWAssess is a foundation model-driven framework that automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates structured assessment reports using semi-supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban waterlogging poses an increasingly severe threat due to climate change, but existing monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide timely and comprehensive assessments.

Method: The framework uses a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to unleash the potential of foundation models for data-scarce downstream tasks, enabling automatic identification of waterlogged areas and generation of structured reports.

Conclusion: UWAssess enables a shift from perception to generation in waterlogging monitoring, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems supporting urban management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaOPT is a self-improving experience library that enables LLMs to learn optimization modeling from limited demonstrations and solver feedback without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates, using a continual two-phase cycle of library learning and evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization modeling is difficult to automate as informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and solver code, with prior LLM approaches relying on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization.

Method: AlphaOPT uses a continual two-phase cycle: Library Learning phase reflects on failed attempts to extract solver-verified structured insights, and Library Evolution phase diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines applicability conditions of stored insights to improve transfer across tasks.

Result: AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

Conclusion: AlphaOPT learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention.

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest

### [128] [PlanU: Large Language Model Decision Making through Planning under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18442)
*Ziwei Deng,Mian Deng,Chenjing Liang,Zeming Gao,Chennan Ma,Chenxing Lin,Haipeng Zhang,Songzhu Mei,Cheng Wang,Siqi Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanU is an LLM-based planning method that integrates uncertainty modeling within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using quantile distributions and a novel UCC score to handle both LLM and environmental uncertainty in decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in stochastic environments, due to both LLM uncertainty (from stochastic sampling) and environmental uncertainty. Existing approaches either overlook environmental uncertainty or are not designed for multi-step decision-making requiring environment interaction.

Method: PlanU integrates uncertainty modeling into MCTS by representing the return of each node as a quantile distribution and introducing an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to balance exploration and exploitation during tree search.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PlanU is effective for LLM-based decision-making tasks under uncertainty, showing improved performance in stochastic environments compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: PlanU successfully addresses the dual challenges of LLM and environmental uncertainty in decision-making by incorporating uncertainty modeling directly into the MCTS framework, enabling more robust planning in stochastic environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

*Shaobo Wang,Yongliang Miao,Yuancheng Liu,and Qianli Ma,Ning Liao,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuitSeer is a novel data selection method that identifies reasoning complexity by measuring data's influence on specialized attention heads in LLMs, achieving better performance with only 10% of data compared to full dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for LLMs rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics, and there's a need for more efficient approaches that leverage the model's internal mechanisms rather than external metrics.

Method: CircuitSeer identifies sparse, specialized attention heads that form core reasoning circuits in LLMs, then quantifies reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial circuits to select high-value training samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets show CircuitSeer's superiority. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of data selected by CircuitSeer achieved 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over training on the full dataset.

Conclusion: CircuitSeer provides an efficient and effective data selection method by leveraging internal model mechanisms, demonstrating that focusing on specialized reasoning circuits can significantly reduce training data requirements while improving performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Probabilistic intent modeling framework for LLM agents that maintains belief distributions over partner intentions and enables adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop socially intelligent LLM agents that can better understand and respond to partner intentions in multi-turn social dialogues.

Method: Maintains belief distribution over partner's latent intentions using contextual priors and dynamic updates through likelihood estimation after each utterance.

Result: Increases Overall score by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared to Qwen2.5-7B baseline, slightly surpassing an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.

Conclusion: Probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to developing socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

*Haichao Ji,Zibo Wang,Yifei Zhu,Meng han,Dan Wang,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA is the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with federated analytics (FA), enabling privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources while supporting natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-agent analytics frameworks lack privacy protection by assuming centralized data access, while federated analytics enables privacy-preserving computation but lacks natural language input support.

Method: LAFA uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with a coarse-grained planner for query decomposition and fine-grained planner for mapping subqueries to FA operation DAGs, plus an optimizer agent for workflow optimization.

Result: LAFA outperforms baseline prompting strategies with higher execution plan success rates and significantly reduces resource-intensive FA operations.

Conclusion: LAFA establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in federated analytics settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

*Haoran Zhang,Chenhao Zhu,Sicong Guo,Hanzhe Guo,Haiming Li,Donglin Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarBench is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' ability to play turn-based RPGs like humans - mapping raw screenshots to low-level actions and deciding when to seek guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with human-like gameplay that requires mapping raw screenshots to temporally coherent low-level actions and deciding when to ask for help, unlike human players who naturally ground visual information into precise controls.

Method: StarBench uses Honkai: Star Rail to evaluate two competencies: multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information seeking. It has two regimes - direct control (raw screenshots to low-level primitives) and tool-assisted control (higher-level intents with OCR support), plus an ask-or-act diagnostic for measuring guidance-seeking behavior.

Result: Baseline results show significant gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in direct control mode, while demonstrating that strategic information seeking correlates with improved success rates.

Conclusion: StarBench provides a reproducible standard for evaluating agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client gameplay, highlighting current limitations and opportunities for improvement in VLMs.

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in AndroidControl benchmark that underestimate GUI agent capabilities, creates AndroidControl-Curated benchmark with 15% higher success rates, and introduces Magma-R1-3B model that matches performance of much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device virtual assistants are limited by rigid APIs, and GUI agents offer an alternative but are perceived as having poor performance due to flawed benchmarks that systematically underrate their capabilities.

Method: Enhanced AndroidControl into AndroidControl-Curated through rigorous purification pipeline to address ambiguities and factual errors, and developed Magma-R1-3B model post-trained on 2.4k curated samples.

Result: On AndroidControl-Curated, state-of-the-art models achieve 75% success rates (15% improvement), and Magma-R1-3B delivers performance comparable to Qwen3-VL-235B despite being 200 times smaller.

Conclusion: On-device GUI agents are closer to practical deployment than previously thought, and the enhanced benchmark better reflects model capabilities to accelerate development of robust virtual assistants.

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal/default configurations but overlooks Tuning Potential - the critical aspect of how well algorithms can be tuned by domain experts for specific scenarios in production environments.

Method: Crucible employs an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to tune algorithms and defines a formalized metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential.

Result: Crucible systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms, demonstrates effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, and validates findings in real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and design that ultimately leads to performance improvements, bridging the gap between ideal algorithmic performance and practical tuning potential in production environments.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal

Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic

systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COUPLE is a counterfactual reasoning framework that uses structural causal models to align large language models with pluralistic human values, addressing value complexity and steerability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs serve diverse cultures and communities, there's a need to align them with pluralistic human values beyond average principles, considering the interdependence and relative priorities of different values as described in psychological value theories.

Method: Proposes COUPLE framework that introduces a structural causal model to capture value interdependency and prioritization, and applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with desired value objectives.

Result: COUPLE outperforms other baselines across diverse value objectives on two datasets with different value systems, and provides better interpretability through explicit causal modeling.

Conclusion: COUPLE effectively addresses the challenges of value complexity and steerability in pluralistic value alignment for LLMs, demonstrating superior performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed an operationally robust flood forecasting emulator that maintains performance under data latency, missing inputs, and inconsistent data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most hydrologic forecasting models are evaluated under ideal data conditions, but real-world operations require resilience to delayed, missing, or inconsistent input data.

Method: Created five neural network architectures combining long- and short-term memory with relaxed water-balance constraints, tested across scenarios from complete data to data outages, trained in US catchments and tested in 5,000+ basins including regulated rivers in India.

Result: The emulator successfully reproduces GloFAS hydrological core and degrades smoothly as data quality declines, maintaining physical coherence even with reduced performance during transfer to different hydroclimatic and management regimes.

Conclusion: Establishes operational robustness as a measurable property in hydrological ML and advances reliable real-time forecasting system design.

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

### [137] [SOCIA-Nabla: Textual Gradient Meets Multi-Agent Orchestration for Automated Simulator Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18551)
*Yuncheng Hua,Sion Weatherhead,Mehdi Jafari,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCIA-Nabla is an end-to-end agentic framework that treats simulator construction as instance optimization over code within a textual computation graph, using LLM-driven agents and Textual-Gradient Descent for automated code synthesis, execution, evaluation, and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To convert brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and simulation granularities, while minimizing expert effort.

Method: Uses specialized LLM-driven agents embedded as graph nodes with a workflow manager executing a loss-driven loop (code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair) and Textual-Gradient Descent optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy across three CPS tasks: User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility.

Conclusion: SOCIA-Nabla successfully unifies multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view, enabling scalable and reproducible simulator code generation across domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

*Federico Barbero,Xiangming Gu,Christopher A. Choquette-Choo,Chawin Sitawarin,Matthew Jagielski,Itay Yona,Petar Veličković,Ilia Shumailov,Jamie Hayes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that alignment training data can be extracted from post-trained models using embedding-based similarity metrics, revealing significant data leakage that string matching methods severely underestimate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the risk of extracting alignment training data from post-trained models, particularly focusing on capabilities like long-context reasoning, safety, instruction following, and math, and to highlight limitations of traditional string matching approaches.

Method: Used embedding models to measure semantic similarity between extracted and original training data, arguing that this approach better captures meaningful similarities than approximate string matching which misses significant data due to trivial artifacts.

Result: Found that models readily regurgitate training data from post-training phases (SFT or RL), and this extracted data can be used to train base models, recovering meaningful performance. String matching severely undercounted extractable data by ~10x.

Conclusion: The work exposes overlooked risks in extracting alignment data and opens discussion on downstream effects of distillation practices, suggesting distillation indirectly trains on original datasets through model regurgitation.

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

Conclusion: QuantEvolve effectively automates trading strategy development while maintaining diversity, with released dataset supporting future research.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a
dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

*Wei Cai,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Ming Zhu,Haichuan Tang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAR is a novel framework that addresses MLLMs' hallucination and linear reasoning issues by decomposing reasoning into traceable evidence grounding and search-based CoT generation with backtracking, guided by multi-faceted reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high hallucination tendency and brittle linear reasoning processes in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that lead to failures in complex tasks.

Method: Decomposes reasoning into traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought generation with backtracking mechanism, guided by semantic and geometric self-verification reward functions.

Result: VAR-7B sets new state-of-the-art on comprehensive hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming open-source models and showing competitive performance against proprietary systems.

Conclusion: VAR effectively addresses MLLMs' limitations through structured search over reasoning trajectories with self-correction mechanisms, validated by theoretical analysis and strong experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

*Gilles Audemard,Sylvie Coste-Marquis,Pierre Marquis,Mehdi Sabiri,Nicolas Szczepanski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new classification approach combining data mining-derived association rules with tree-based models to improve both predictive performance and explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classification models by integrating knowledge from data-derived association rules, addressing both predictive accuracy and explanation comprehensiveness.

Method: Use data mining to extract association rules (including negations) from data, then leverage these rules to boost performance of decision trees and random forests, and generate more general abductive explanations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved predictive performance and smaller explanation sizes for both decision trees and random forests when using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Combining data-derived association rules with tree-based classification models offers significant benefits in both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

*Carlo Proietti,Antonio Yuste-Ginel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies expressivity of abstract vs structured argumentation models with uncertainty, introducing a new expressivity measure and providing comparative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in studying plausible instantiations of abstract uncertainty models in argumentation, grounding uncertainty in argument components rather than abstract frameworks.

Method: Developed a notion of expressivity applicable to both abstract and structured formalisms, and conducted comparative analysis of expressivity between incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks (with dependencies) and structured ASPIC+ models.

Result: Presented both negative and positive expressivity results showing the comparative expressivity capabilities of abstract vs structured approaches to argumentation with uncertainty.

Conclusion: The expressivity analysis provides insights into how uncertainty can be effectively modeled in formal argumentation, with implications for both abstract frameworks and structured approaches like ASPIC+.

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

*Roxana Petcu,Kenton Murray,Daniel Khashabi,Evangelos Kanoulas,Maarten de Rijke,Dawn Lawrie,Kevin Duh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using bandit learning methods to optimize document retrieval in RAG systems by balancing exploration-exploitation trade-offs, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and downstream generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems need to efficiently select informative documents by balancing comprehensive retrieval with noise reduction and computational cost limitations.

Method: Formulates query decomposition and document retrieval as an exploitation-exploration problem using bandit learning methods, estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments.

Result: Achieved 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in α-nDCG, and better performance on long-form generation tasks.

Conclusion: Bandit learning approaches effectively optimize document retrieval in RAG systems by dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SherlockLLM is a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that uses Reinforcement Learning to learn optimal questioning strategies for clarifying ambiguous user queries, achieving performance comparable to binary search on structured tasks and significantly outperforming baselines on unstructured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it hard to identify user intent from single queries. Existing dialogue-based systems lack explicit strategies to ask the most informative questions efficiently.

Method: Proposed SherlockLLM framework that trains an agent via Reinforcement Learning to generate sequences of binary questions to narrow down search space, avoiding need for large-scale annotated dialogue data.

Result: On structured tasks, performance matches strong baselines and approaches theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On challenging unstructured tasks, significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating effective information-seeking dialogue policy learning.

Conclusion: SherlockLLM provides a robust and efficient solution for dialogue-driven retrieval, capable of learning highly effective questioning strategies through RL without requiring extensive annotated data.

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALGOS is a segmentation-and-reasoning system that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity estimation for monitoring harmful algal blooms, achieving robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is intensifying harmful algal blooms (cyanobacteria) that threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, while traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive and limited in coverage. Vision-language models show potential but need better reasoning and severity quantification.

Method: Integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using NASA's Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) dataset.

Result: ALGOS demonstrates robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The system paves the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems for environmental protection.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

TL;DR: This study analyzes 18 years of Canadian research proposals to understand research trends and demographic influences, comparing three topic modeling approaches and introducing COFFEE algorithm for BERTopic covariate analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize national scientific investment by understanding evolving research trends and demographic/geographical forces, particularly in light of equity, diversity, and inclusion commitments.

Method: Analyzed 18 years (2005-2022) of NSERC research proposals using three topic modeling approaches: LDA, STM, and BERTopic. Introduced COFFEE algorithm for covariate effect estimation in BERTopic.

Result: BERTopic outperformed other models by identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent themes (e.g., AI expansion). COFFEE-enabled covariate analysis revealed distinct provincial research specializations and consistent gender-based thematic patterns across disciplines.

Conclusion: The insights provide empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more equitable and impactful funding strategies, enhancing scientific ecosystem effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

TL;DR: Robotic intervention can reduce school shooter victims by 46.6% when using aggressive positioning and high-distraction methods like sirens, lights, and smoke.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how robotic intervention can distract and impede school shooters in high-risk scenarios to enhance safety in school environments.

Method: Conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as school shooters. Tested different robot approaches (aggressive vs. passive) and distraction methods (low to high) including sirens, lights, and smoke.

Result: An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% compared to no-robot control conditions.

Conclusion: Robotic intervention shows significant potential for enhancing safety in school shooting scenarios, but raises important ethical questions about their deployment in educational environments.

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios
by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To
evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university
participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an
autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself
strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to
approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the
shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction
method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to
siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,
high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a
no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic
intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding
their use in school environments.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with humanoid robots that learns end-to-end policies using human motion priors via adversarial training, enabling natural, dynamic interactions with moving objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid goalkeeping presents unique challenges compared to quadrupedal platforms: generating natural human-like whole-body motions and covering wider guarding ranges with equivalent response times. Existing approaches rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion tracking, lacking full autonomy.

Method: Single end-to-end RL policy trained with multiple human motion priors conditioned on perceptual inputs via an adversarial scheme, enabling fully autonomous and dynamic robot-object interactions.

Result: Real-world experiments show the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous, and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. The method also generalizes to tasks like ball escaping and grabbing.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical and scalable solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving objects, advancing toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic behaviors.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with
humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated
similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces
two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions,
and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion
tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL
policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object
interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors
conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial
scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world
experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous,
and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to
goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks
such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable
solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving
objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic
behaviors.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a coordinated guidance vector field (CGVF) algorithm for multi-robot navigation on m-dimensional manifolds in n-dimensional space, enabling flexible spatial ordering using non-Euclidean metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the strong coupling problem in multi-robot navigation on manifolds where traditional approaches face challenges with on-manifold maneuvering and ordering-flexible coordination due to coupled propagation terms.

Method: The authors identify feasible auxiliary vectors to decouple propagation terms, redesign CGVF algorithm by treating manifold parameters as virtual coordinates, and enable ordering-flexible coordination through shared virtual coordinates with neighbors and virtual target robot.

Result: Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's flexibility with different initial positions, adaptability to higher-dimensional manifolds, and robustness to robot breakdown scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed CGVF algorithm successfully achieves flexible spatial ordering for multi-robot navigation on manifolds while eliminating singularities and ensuring global convergence through non-Euclidean metric coordination.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots
maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial
ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved
via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be
characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$
entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the
partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not
appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold
maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further
design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.
  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary
vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively
decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)
algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global
convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual
coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion
coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its
time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the
possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally,
we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness
through extensive simulations with different initial positions,
higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

TL;DR: R2BC enables single human operators to train multi-robot systems through sequential single-agent demonstrations, matching or surpassing performance of oracle methods trained on synchronized multi-agent data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend imitation learning to multi-agent systems where a single human must train collaborating robots, addressing the challenge of providing joint demonstrations.

Method: Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC) allows human operators to teleoperate one agent at a time in sequence, incrementally teaching multi-agent behavior without requiring demonstrations in joint action space.

Result: R2BC matches and sometimes surpasses oracle behavior cloning trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks, and successfully deployed on two physical robot tasks with real human demonstrations.

Conclusion: R2BC provides an effective and practical approach for single human operators to train multi-robot systems through sequential demonstrations, eliminating the need for complex joint demonstration collection.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots,
particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has
been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have
addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in
settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of
collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin
Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to
effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent
demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a
time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without
requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that
R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle
behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations
across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two
physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

*Dharmik Patel,Antonio Rafael Vazquez Pantoja,Jiuzhou Lei,Kiju Lee,Xiao Liang,Minghui Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cable-driven soft gripper inspired by drawstrings for gentle fruit harvesting, using 3D-printed TPU pockets with steel wires to constrict around fruits, achieving 0% immediate damage and <9% bruising rate on tomatoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fruit harvesting is labor-intensive, and existing grippers have limitations: rigid/vacuum grippers require complex design or high energy, while current enveloping grippers lack adaptability to different fruit sizes.

Method: Drawstring-inspired design using 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around fruit when actuated. Servo-driven cable control with motor feedback enables autonomous grip adjustment and tunable grip strength.

Result: For tomatoes within the gripper's effective size range: 0% immediate damage rate and less than 9% bruising rate after five days. The lightweight design reduces mechanical complexity and cost.

Conclusion: The cable-driven soft gripper demonstrates suitability for fruit harvesting with gentle handling, adaptability to varying fruit sizes, and effective damage prevention.

Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating
the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or
vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy
consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack
adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a
drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit
harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when
actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow
versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which
requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to
other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while
motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.
Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective
size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a
bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's
suitability for fruit harvesting.

### [153] [Quality Over Quantity: Curating Contact-Based Robot Datasets Improves Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18137)
*Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Victor Vantilborgh,Ian Abraham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Contact-aware Fisher-information metric helps rank and curate contact data for robot learning, showing that less but informative data can accelerate learning more effectively than larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether more data or the 'right' data is better for robot learning, particularly focusing on the utility of contact-based data which contains significant information for robot learning.

Method: Developed a contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from pose and contact data, using contact-aware Fisher-information metric to rank and curate contact data based on informativeness.

Result: Selecting reduced datasets based on the ranking improves learning tasks and makes learning deterministic. More data is not necessarily better - less but informative data can accelerate learning, especially depending on contact interactions.

Conclusion: The contact-aware Fisher-information metric provides effective guidance for data curation in contact-based robot learning, demonstrating the importance of data quality over quantity.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data
or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are
interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds
significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a
contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from
pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric
can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is
for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on
this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a
deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not
necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate
learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how
our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for
contact-based robot learning.

### [154] [MoMaGen: Generating Demonstrations under Soft and Hard Constraints for Multi-Step Bimanual Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18316)
*Chengshu Li,Mengdi Xu,Arpit Bahety,Hang Yin,Yunfan Jiang,Huang Huang,Josiah Wong,Sujay Garlanka,Cem Gokmen,Ruohan Zhang,Weiyu Liu,Jiajun Wu,Roberto Martín-Martín,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoMaGen is a framework that formulates automated data generation for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation as a constrained optimization problem, addressing key challenges of base placement and camera positioning to enable training successful imitation learning policies from minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale human demonstrations for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation is costly and time-consuming, as it requires teleoperating both a mobile base and two high-DoF arms. Prior automated data generation methods work for static bimanual manipulation but fail in mobile settings due to challenges in determining base placement for reachability and camera positioning for visibility.

Method: MoMaGen formulates data generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints (e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during navigation). This provides a principled foundation that generalizes prior approaches.

Result: MoMaGen generates significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods on four multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks. It can train successful imitation learning policies from a single source demonstration and achieve deployment on physical hardware with as few as 40 real-world demonstrations after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MoMaGen provides an effective framework for automated data generation in complex multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, enabling successful policy training from minimal demonstrations and facilitating real-world deployment with limited fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven
effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and
time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile
manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two
high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have
addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations
in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key
challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)
positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor
policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data
generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints
(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during
navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a
principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four
multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates
significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this
diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a
single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few
as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic
hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

### [155] [MoTVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Unified Fast-Slow Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18337)
*Wenhui Huang,Changhe Chen,Han Qi,Chen Lv,Yilun Du,Heng Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoTVLA is a mixture-of-transformers VLA model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning to improve language steerability and reduce inference latency in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches face limited language steerability without reasoning or significant inference latency when reasoning is incorporated, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-transformers architecture with a generalist (pre-trained VLM) for perception and planning, and a domain expert for fast reasoning and motion decomposition, conditioning action generation on decomposed instructions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show superiority in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance across NLP benchmarks, simulation, and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MoTVLA successfully balances reasoning capabilities with execution efficiency, improving language steerability while maintaining fast inference for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
(serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
reasoning and manipulation task performance.

*Muhammad Hanif,Reiji Terunuma,Takumi Sumino,Kelvin Cheng,Takeshi Hatanaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Coverage-Recon is a coordinated image sampling algorithm that integrates online 3D map feedback from NeuralRecon to improve multi-drone collaborative reconstruction quality in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D reconstruction requires capturing images from diverse viewing angles, and real-time reconstruction algorithms now enable immediate feedback to guide drone motion.

Method: Uses QP-based angle-aware coverage controller for drone coordination, processes images with NeuralRecon for real-time 3D mesh generation, and uses mesh changes as reconstruction uncertainty feedback to update coverage importance.

Result: Simulation and experiments show Coverage-Recon produces more complete and accurate 3D reconstructions than conventional methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Incorporating online map feedback significantly improves collaborative 3D reconstruction quality for multi-drone systems.

Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:

### [157] [PGTT: Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal for Perceptive Legged Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18348)
*Alexandros Ntagkas,Chairi Kiourt,Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PGTT is a perception-aware deep-RL approach for legged robots that uses phase-guided reward shaping instead of gait priors, enabling morphology-agnostic deployment and achieving superior robustness on challenging terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perceptive RL controllers either impose restrictive gait priors that reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or operate 'blind' which struggle with terrain anticipation and are brittle to noise.

Method: PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics, adds swing-phase contact penalty, and uses policy acting directly in joint space. Trained with curriculum and domain randomization on procedurally generated stair-like terrains.

Result: PGTT achieves highest success under push disturbances (+7.5% median improvement) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking and 2x faster convergence than end-to-end baselines. Validated on Unitree Go2 and ANYmal-C with same hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms, reducing inductive bias while maintaining performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged
robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the
action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability
across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to
anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we
propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL
approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely
through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning
compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase
as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap
statistics and adds a swing-phase contact penalty, while the policy acts
directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in
MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and
domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances
(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with
comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x
faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2
using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report
preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These
findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a
simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

*Mingxin Li,Haibo Hu,Jinghuai Deng,Yuchen Xi,Xinhong Chen,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MMRHP is a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that enables rigorous quantitative analysis of autonomous driving systems through a systematic three-phase testing process aligned with SOTIF standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current miniaturized HIL platforms lack systematic frameworks for rigorous quantitative analysis, limiting their value as scientific evaluation tools for autonomous driving validation.

Method: Proposed MMRHP platform with three-phase testing process for SOTIF compliance, featuring unified spatiotemporal measurement core for consistent quantification of physical motion and system timing.

Result: Platform validation achieved 10.27 mm RMSE spatial accuracy and 45 ms stable closed-loop latency baseline. Autoware case study identified critical performance cliff at 40 ms injected latency.

Conclusion: Structured process combined with unified spatio-temporal benchmark enables reproducible, interpretable, and quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test
fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework
supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their
value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose
MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized
testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative
analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic
three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended
Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the
performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning
systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a
unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring
consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through
comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a
spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of
approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged
this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a
critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows
that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified
spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and
quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

*Wanchen Li,Kahina Chalabi,Sabbah Maxime,Thomas Bousquet,Robin Passama,Sofiane Ramdani,Andrea Cherubini,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time human action recognition framework using 2D cameras and biomechanical joint angles, achieving 88% accuracy with strong generalization across subjects and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods rely on joint center positions and operate offline, lacking real-time capability and robustness to sensor/subject variations in industrial contexts.

Method: Complete pipeline with robust joint kinematics estimation, temporally smoothed Transformer-based network using biomechanical prior (joint angles) instead of joint positions.

Result: Outperforms best baseline model with 88% accuracy, runs in real-time, shows great generalization for subjects not facing cameras, validated through online robot interaction experiment.

Conclusion: The proposed method using joint angles enables fast, robust real-time action recognition that is agnostic to sensor/subject poses and anthropometric differences, suitable for industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
real-time via the recognized actions.

*Matthias Lorenzen,Teodoro Alamo,Martina Mammarella,Fabrizio Dabbene*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel MPC formulation for non-holonomic systems with non-convex constraints that guarantees convergence to target in motion planning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in fundamental MPC literature which typically assumes holonomic systems and convex constraints, while real-world motion planning for autonomous robots requires handling non-holonomic systems and non-convex constraints with proven completeness.

Method: Developed a new model predictive control formulation specifically designed for output tracking of non-holonomic systems with non-convex constraints.

Result: The proposed MPC formulation guarantees convergence to the desired target under realistic assumptions that can be verified in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretically sound MPC framework for motion planning of autonomous mobile robots that addresses the limitations of existing approaches and ensures target reachability under practical conditions.

Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for
motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for
non-holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the
advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several
papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC
it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the
state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented
publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness,
in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has
received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a
novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under
realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.

*Fang Nan,Hao Ma,Qinghua Guan,Josie Hughes,Michael Muehlebach,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Online model-based RL algorithm for real-world robotic control that builds dynamics models from interaction data, achieving high sample efficiency and robust adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable direct training of control policies on real robots without relying on biased simulation data, overcoming limitations of sim-to-real pipelines and model-free methods.

Method: Builds dynamics model from real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned model, with formal sublinear regret guarantees under stochastic optimization assumptions.

Result: Demonstrated strong sample efficiency on hydraulic excavator and soft robot arms, reaching comparable performance to model-free methods within hours, with robust adaptation to changing payload conditions.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and reliable on-robot learning for challenging control tasks by reducing sample requirements and simulation bias.

Abstract: We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable
for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike
prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and
model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from
real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned
dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme
significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling
direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the
influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for
high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive
sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization
assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more
interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a
hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates
strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods,
reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting
dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our
approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a
broad class of challenging control tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EfficientNav enables on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot object navigation by pruning redundant map information and optimizing KV cache usage, achieving better performance than GPT-4 with significantly reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object navigation agents rely on cloud-based giant LLMs like GPT-4, which prevents deployment on local devices due to high latency and the limited capacity of smaller LLMs to understand complex navigation maps.

Method: Proposed semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant map information, discrete memory caching, and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use KV cache for reduced planning latency.

Result: Achieved 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4 baselines, with 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

Conclusion: EfficientNav successfully enables efficient on-device object navigation by optimizing both map understanding and computational efficiency, outperforming cloud-based solutions while being deployable locally.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
code will be released soon.

nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization
of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to
design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight,
grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's
kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand planetary exploration capabilities beyond wheeled rovers by using legged robots that can traverse difficult terrain like rugged landscapes and jump over cracks

Method: Conducted field experiments on Vulcano volcano using quadruped robots with state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms in high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar/Martian surfaces

Result: Successfully validated newly developed locomotion algorithms through field deployment and testing

Conclusion: Legged robots with advanced control algorithms can significantly enhance planetary exploration missions by accessing more challenging terrain

Abstract: Missions such as the Ingenuity helicopter have shown the advantages of using
novel locomotion modes to increase the scientific return of planetary
exploration missions. Legged robots can further expand the reach and capability
of future planetary missions by traversing more difficult terrain than wheeled
rovers, such as jumping over cracks on the ground or traversing rugged terrain
with boulders. To develop and test algorithms for using quadruped robots, the
AAPLE project was carried out at DFKI. As part of the project, we conducted a
series of field experiments on the Volcano on the Aeolian island of Vulcano, an
active stratovolcano near Sicily, Italy. The experiments focused on validating
newly developed state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for
quadrupedal locomotion in a high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Models achieve impressive results across domains but struggle to adapt to dynamic real-world scenarios without complete retraining, limiting their practical flexibility.

Method: Apply Continual Learning and Compositionality principles to Foundation Models to enable adaptation and flexibility.

Result: Not specified in the abstract - this appears to be a proposal rather than reporting experimental results.

Conclusion: The combination of Continual Learning and Compositionality can lead to more flexible, efficient, and intelligent AI solutions that better handle real-world dynamics.

Abstract: The birth of Foundation Models brought unprecedented results in a wide range
of tasks, from language to vision, to robotic control. These models are able to
process huge quantities of data, and can extract and develop rich
representations, which can be employed across different domains and modalities.
However, they still have issues in adapting to dynamic, real-world scenarios
without retraining the entire model from scratch. In this work, we propose the

### [166] [Least Restrictive Hyperplane Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18643)
*Mattias Trende,Petter Ögren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes optimizing over combinations of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and safe controls to achieve desired control actions while maintaining safety guarantees, introducing the concept of least restrictive Hyperplane-CBFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding valid CBFs for complex systems with complex unsafe regions is challenging, and conservative approximations often restrict control actions unnecessarily. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by optimizing CBF selection rather than accepting overly conservative constraints.

Method: The approach optimizes over a combination of CBFs and safe controls simultaneously, using a smooth parameterization of the CBF-family. This allows finding the least restrictive Hyperplane-CBF that still provides safety guarantees while minimizing interference with desired control actions.

Result: The method successfully demonstrates the approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints, navigating through arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles, showing improved performance over traditional conservative CBF approaches.

Conclusion: By optimizing over CBFs and controls together rather than sequentially, the proposed method provides safety guarantees while being less restrictive than traditional conservative CBF approaches, enabling better performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares walking vs sliding locomotion for quadruped robots on planetary terrains, analyzing Cost of Transport across different slopes and friction conditions to identify transition thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged rovers offer better mobility on steep/irregular planetary terrain but traditional walking can be inefficient and dangerous on loose, inclined surfaces like crater walls and cave slopes.

Method: Combines physics-based simulations in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky to compare Cost of Transport of walking vs torso-based sliding locomotion across slopes, friction conditions, and speed levels.

Result: Identifies intersections between walking and sliding CoT curves, defining threshold conditions that could trigger transitions between locomotion strategies.

Conclusion: Represents an initial step toward developing adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary legged rovers that can switch between walking and sliding based on terrain conditions.

Abstract: Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
legged rovers.

*Phuoc Nguyen,Francesco Verdoja,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces EGG (event-grounding graph), a framework that connects spatial features to dynamic events in robotic scene understanding, enabling robots to answer complex spatio-temporal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic scene representations lack connections between spatial features and dynamic events, limiting robots' ability to understand and respond to complex environmental interactions in daily life assistance scenarios.

Method: Proposes the event-grounding graph (EGG) framework that grounds event interactions to spatial features of a scene, allowing perception, reasoning, and response to spatio-temporal queries.

Result: Experiments using real robotic data show EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries about environment and events.

Conclusion: EGG successfully bridges the gap between spatial features and dynamic events, with the framework and evaluation dataset released as open-source for community use.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can
assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental
representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched
robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between
spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event
washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a
framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This
representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex
spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's
capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human
inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG
framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:

*Alexander Krawciw,Sven Lilge,Luka Antonyshyn,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for multi-vehicle cargo transport that enables precise convoying using shared map localization without GNSS, achieving within 20 cm spacing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teams of mobile robots provide more operational flexibility than single large robots for cargo transport, requiring precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking.

Method: Distributed MPC that builds on lidar teach and repeat for precise path tracking, using shared map localization without GNSS or direct observations to maintain Euclidean distance offsets between vehicles.

Result: Distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to centralized MPC, maintains maximum spacing within 20 cm of target in various conditions, and works in real-time for convoys of 2-3 rovers over 10+ km of driving.

Conclusion: The distributed MPC approach provides operational flexibility suitable for real deployments, with direct distance measurement improving close-range tracking but struggling with long-range offsets.

Abstract: For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more
operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of
lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a
Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.
Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other
without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized
MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.
The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex
centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between
the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range
scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility
provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real
deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km
of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the
proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying
to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

*Emad Razavi,Angelo Bratta,João Carlos Virgolino Soares,Carmine Recchiuto,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Online semantic object mapping system for quadruped robots that integrates sensor data to create persistent object instances in a global map, enabling stable object tracking across viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quadruped robots to create persistent semantic maps of indoor environments by integrating sensor detections into named objects that remain in the map when out of view.

Method: Integrates range geometry with camera detections, merges co-located detections within frames, and associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames. Objects are maintained when out of view and repeated sightings update existing instances.

Result: The system produces a compact object layer that can be queried for class, pose, and confidence, integrated with occupancy maps and readable by planners. On-robot tests showed the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

Conclusion: The semantic object mapping system successfully creates persistent object instances that remain stable during robot operation, providing reliable semantic information for planning and navigation in indoor environments.

Abstract: We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot
operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named
objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry
with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and
associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames.
Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings
update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a
compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is
integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests,
the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MADR is a framework that combines MPC guidance with deep learning to approximate value functions for two-player zero-sum differential games, overcoming dimensionality issues in Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the curse of dimensionality in Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and improve convergence issues in physics-informed deep learning for multi-agent adversarial scenarios.

Method: MPC-guided Adversarial DeepReach (MADR) framework that enriches self-supervision with regular supervision from optimal control problems to approximate two-player zero-sum differential game value functions.

Result: MADR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in simulation and produces impressive results in hardware across various high-dimensional robotic agents with different dynamics and games.

Conclusion: MADR provides a robust framework for approximating value functions in adversarial games, enabling optimal strategies for both players and safe policies for worst-case robustness in high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.
