### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge enables efficient on-device CNN fine-tuning for edge applications like HAR by combining LoRA with tensor-train decomposition, reducing trainable parameters by up to 99% while maintaining near-full fine-tuning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of CNNs is infeasible on edge devices due to strict memory, compute, and energy constraints, especially for handling domain shift in applications like Human Activity Recognition.

Method: Applies Tensor-Train SVD to pre-trained convolutional layers, selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels without changing inference cost.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating only 1.49% of parameters, with 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on Jetson Orin Nano compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms, enabling effective domain adaptation under strict resource constraints.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source labeling software that bridges the gap between behavioral labeling and individual localization in video analysis, enabling annotation of animal interactions for computer vision model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing annotation tools either support behavioral labeling without localization or localization without interaction capture, creating a gap for analyzing social and individualized animal behavior in video data.

Method: Developed SILVI - an open-source labeling software that integrates both behavioral annotation and individual localization functionalities, allowing researchers to annotate behaviors and interactions directly within video data.

Result: SILVI generates structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models, facilitating the development of automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses.

Conclusion: SILVI effectively links behavioral ecology with computer vision and could be broadly useful for annotating interactions in various video contexts beyond animal behavior, including human interaction analysis.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates using noise injection techniques during training to improve deep learning model generalization for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays, reducing performance gaps between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays fail to generalize to new clinical sources due to learning source-specific artifacts rather than meaningful biomarkers, creating performance gaps between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Method: The study applies fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during model training to enhance robustness to distribution shifts.

Result: Noise injection significantly reduced the performance gap between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across key metrics (AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, specificity) averaged over ten random seeds.

Conclusion: Noise injection during training is an effective technique for improving model generalization and reducing performance disparities between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Imitation learning policies for X-ray-guided spine cannula insertion were developed and tested in simulation, achieving 68.5% first-attempt success rate with safe trajectories and good generalization to complex anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether imitation learning-based robot control policies can be applied to X-ray-guided spine procedures, which are complex due to multi-view X-ray interpretation challenges.

Method: Created an in silico sandbox for realistic simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures, curated dataset of correct trajectories and bi-planar X-ray sequences, trained imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align cannula based on visual information.

Result: Policy succeeded on first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintained safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels, generalized to complex anatomy including fractures, remained robust to varied initializations, and produced plausible trajectories on real bi-planar X-rays despite simulation-only training.

Conclusion: While promising with good generalization, limitations exist in entry point precision and closed-loop control requires more frequent feedback. With improved priors and domain knowledge, such models could provide foundation for CT-free robotic spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an enhanced real-time object detection framework using pruned YOLOv12 with Self-Adversarial Training and specialized data augmentation for automated waste detection in desert environments, achieving high accuracy and efficiency suitable for drone deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global waste crisis and limitations of traditional waste collection methods in remote/harsh environments like deserts, where current computer vision research focuses mainly on urban settings and recyclable materials while overlooking organic/hazardous waste.

Method: Enhanced real-time object detection framework based on pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies, evaluated using the DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants.

Conclusion: Validates the effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments, providing an optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency for practical deployment.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-Based Image Composition creates composite images from multiple same-class images to address class imbalance and small dataset issues, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) on OCT medical imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality lead to high false prediction rates in deep learning models, particularly in medical imaging where class imbalance is common.

Method: Proposes Class-Based Image Composition that fuses multiple images of the same class into Composite Input Images (CoImg) to enhance intra-class variance and information density. Applied to OCT retinal scans with 3x1 layout composites.

Result: Achieved near-perfect performance: 99.6% accuracy, 0.995 F1-score, 0.9996 AUC on the Co-OCTDL dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models trained on raw imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses class imbalance and small dataset limitations, producing high-quality predictions even with challenging medical imaging data.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection framework for medical imaging that incrementally expands normal samples using lightweight adapters and uncertainty-gated admission, achieving significant performance improvements without labeled anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly, requiring an unsupervised approach that doesn't rely on anomaly labels.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained vision backbone with tiny convolutional adapters for domain adaptation, k-NN anomaly scoring with compact coreset, and dual probabilistic gates (z-score threshold and SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty) for safe incremental expansion of normal samples.

Result: Substantial performance gains: COVID-CXR ROC-AUC improved from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); Pneumonia CXR ROC-AUC rose from 0.6834 to 0.8968; Brain MRI ND-5 ROC-AUC increased from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and efficient for real-world medical imaging applications with scarce labels, steadily refining normality concepts as unlabeled data arrives without relying on generative reconstruction or replay buffers.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for optimal temporal localization and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for efficient computation allocation, achieving significant performance improvements with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal action localization methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in boundary detection difficulty, leading to inefficient resource allocation.

Method: BDR uses signed-distance regression instead of classification for boundary detection, while ATR employs continuous depth selection for adaptive computation allocation without reinforcement learning. Knowledge distillation is used to mitigate training costs.

Result: BDR achieves 43% sharper boundary peaks and 1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7 improvements across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs (vs 53.6% at 198G), providing 2.9% improvement with 18% less compute. Gains scale to 4.2% on short actions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide information-theoretically optimal localization and efficient computation allocation, validated across four benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for joint optimization of mesh geometry and appearance using Gaussian-guided differentiable rendering, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple geometry and appearance optimization, prioritizing either geometric accuracy or photorealistic rendering, which hinders downstream editing applications.

Method: Simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric regularization from normal and depth maps.

Result: Obtains high-quality 3D reconstruction that can be exploited in downstream editing tasks such as relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel framework for seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization that unifies geometry and appearance treatment for improved 3D reconstruction quality suitable for editing applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a linear fractional transformation parameter to decouple main lens and micro lens array for light field camera calibration, with analytical solution and nonlinear refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is crucial but challenging for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras.

Method: Uses linear fractional transformation parameter α to decouple main lens and micro lens array, with analytical solution based on least squares followed by nonlinear refinement, and introduces feature detection from raw images.

Result: Experimental results on both physical and simulated data verify the performance of the proposed method, and the model enables faster simulation of raw light field images.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration method is effective and enables faster simulation for data-driven deep learning approaches, with code available from the author's website.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new synthetic dataset called Room Envelopes is introduced for predicting structural scene elements like walls, floors, and ceilings, enabling monocular geometry estimators to reconstruct both visible surfaces and structural layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods are incomplete as they only recover visible surfaces, missing occluded structural elements. Structural elements like walls, floors and ceilings should be easier to predict due to their planar, repetitive and simple nature.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with RGB images and two pointmaps per image: one for visible surfaces and one for structural layouts after removing fixtures. This enables direct supervision for feed-forward monocular geometry estimators.

Result: The dataset facilitates training models that can predict both first visible surfaces and first layout surfaces, providing understanding of scene extent and object shapes/locations.

Conclusion: The Room Envelopes dataset enables progress on structural scene element prediction, allowing reconstruction of both visible and occluded structural surfaces through supervised learning approaches.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use 3D visuospatial pose information for social interaction recognition, which outperforms current AI vision models. A compact set of 3D social pose features (face position and direction) matches full joint data's predictive power and improves AI model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humans excel at social interaction recognition while AI struggles, and test the hypothesis that 3D pose information is crucial for these judgments.

Method: Combined pose and depth estimation to extract 3D joint positions from videos, compared with AI vision models, and derived minimal 3D social pose features focusing on face position and direction.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI vision models. Minimal 3D social pose features matched full joint data's predictive strength and improved AI model performance when combined with embeddings.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding relies on explicit 3D pose representations and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives, providing insights for improving AI social perception.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [13] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF is a camera-aware 3D Gaussian segmentation framework that achieves multi-view consistency by incorporating camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions and aligning per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to incorporate camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions, and In-Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets respectively.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable and view-consistent 3D scene understanding with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework for improving physical consistency in text-to-video generation through PhysicsRM reward modeling and PhyDPO optimization, achieving better physical realism while maintaining visual quality.


<details>

Result: Extensive experiments show PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work represents a critical advancement toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation that can be deployed in real-world applications requiring physical consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing is effective for robust and lightweight domain generalization in Vision Transformers, demonstrating the utility of GNN routing over traditional token-based approaches.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction, confirming superior fidelity as a representation for 3D learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports

field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight biometric authentication system using PPG signals from fingertip videos achieves 98% accuracy by converting signals to time-frequency scalograms and processing with a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals offer non-invasive, liveness-detecting biometric authentication suitable for wearables, but face challenges from motion artifacts and physiological variability that require robust feature extraction.

Method: PPG signals from low-frame-rate fingertip videos undergo preprocessing (baseline removal, PCA motion artifact suppression, filtering, resampling, normalization), are converted to 2D scalograms via CWT, and processed by a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model combining spatial and temporal features.

Result: The system achieved 98% authentication accuracy on 46 subjects, demonstrating robustness to noise and inter-subject variability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications due to its liveness detection capability and high accuracy.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is a novel framework that aligns visual and brain representations with language embeddings to decode neural signals (EEG, MEG, fMRI) into visual semantics, addressing subject variability and visual feature entanglement through multimodal alignment and uncertainty perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align neural activity directly with visual embeddings but fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and robustness. Subject variability and entangled visual features in neural signals pose fundamental challenges for visual semantics decoding.

Method: Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic components, projects both visual and brain representations into a shared latent space, and uses learnable language-anchored semantic matrices. It incorporates an uncertainty perception module for noisy neural signals and employs a two-stage training strategy (single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning).

Result: Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks show Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 14.3% improvement in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

Conclusion: Bratrix successfully addresses the limitations of visual-only representations by enabling multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment, demonstrating superior performance in decoding neural signals into visual semantics across multiple neuroimaging modalities.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares two unpaired CT image denoising methods: CycleGAN-based residual translator and Noise2Score. CycleGAN with optimized parameters achieved better final quality (38.91 dB PSNR), while Noise2Score showed strong performance on very noisy inputs without requiring clean pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study CT image denoising in unpaired and self-supervised settings where clean reference images are not available, evaluating training-data-efficient methods that don't require paired training data.

Method: Evaluated two paradigms: 1) CycleGAN-based residual translator with optimized parameters (lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64) using U-Net backbone, 2) Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Used common evaluation protocol with configuration sweep and extended training.

Result: Selected CycleGAN improved noisy input from 34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM to 38.91 dB/0.971 SSIM, with estimated score 1.9441 and Kaggle leaderboard score 1.9343. Noise2Score performed slightly worse in absolute PSNR/SSIM but showed large gains on very noisy inputs.

Conclusion: CycleGAN provides the strongest final image quality for CT denoising, while Noise2Score offers a robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance, especially useful when clean pairs are unavailable.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders to create a more expressive and data-efficient medical image segmentation architecture that outperforms CNN- and Transformer-based methods, especially in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges with complex anatomical structures and limited annotated data. CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies while Transformers are data-hungry and computationally expensive, creating a need for more efficient architectures.

Method: Proposes UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders, using Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer to address inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently surpassing CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Shows superior accuracy in data-scarce settings with reduced FLOPs and minimal parameter increase.

Conclusion: KAN-enhanced Transformers have strong potential to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation, effectively addressing the data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

TL;DR: SpatialLock is a novel framework that uses perception signals and grounding information to achieve precise control over object localization in text-to-image generation, addressing the challenge of spatial layout understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods fail to fully utilize positional information, leading to inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts and imprecise control over object localization.

Method: SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) that integrates spatial information through attention layers, and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) that uses perception-based supervision to refine object localization.

Result: Experiments show SpatialLock achieves state-of-the-art performance for precise object positioning, with IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets, while also improving visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed SpatialLock framework successfully enables precise control over object spatial arrangements in text-to-image generation through joint perception and grounding information utilization.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

### [23] [Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117)
*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG is a training-free diffusion sampling acceleration method that treats classifier-free guidance as a multirate ODE system, allowing different integration frequencies for noise estimation (fine grid) and guidance terms (coarse grid), reducing function evaluations by 30% without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diffusion solvers fail to exploit the redundancy in guidance terms, which are more robust to approximation errors than noise estimates, leading to unnecessary computation.

Method: Reformulates CFG ODE as multirate system, uses tortoise equation for noise estimation on fine grid and hare equation for guidance on coarse grid, plus adaptive timestep sampler and guidance-scale scheduler.

Result: Reduces NFE by up to 30% with minimal fidelity loss (ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032), outperforms state-of-the-art training-free accelerators under same computation budget.

Conclusion: Multirate formulations offer significant potential for diffusion solver acceleration, enabling real-time high-quality image synthesis without model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles, focusing mainly on generic synthesis without explicit style guidance.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion framework that incorporates reference sketch features as auxiliary information with linear smoothing and style-content guidance mechanism, avoiding overwriting self-attention matrices like previous methods.

Result: The approach achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment, reduces content leakage from reference sketches, and works well even with low structural similarity between reference and target sketches.

Conclusion: The framework enables flexible and precise style control in sketch generation through text prompts and reference sketches, with improved synthesis quality and support for multi-style generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

TL;DR: DMSORT is an efficient dual-branch maritime multi-object tracking method that combines object detection/ReID with camera motion compensation to handle challenging maritime environments with camera motion and visual degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime MOT faces challenges from camera motion and visual degradation in complex marine environments, which affect vessel navigation safety and maritime surveillance effectiveness.

Method: Uses parallel tracker with affine compensation: RCDN for robust object detection, Li-TAE Transformer for appearance features, and a dedicated branch for camera motion compensation via projective transformation and Kalman filter stabilization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Singapore Maritime Dataset with fastest runtime among ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter/occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT effectively addresses maritime MOT challenges through its dual-branch architecture, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in handling camera motion and environmental degradation.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded

### [28] [Learning from Online Videos at Inference Time for Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04137)
*Yujian Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Xiaodong Yu,Jialian Wu,Jiang Liu,Emad Barsoum,Zicheng Liu,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enables computer-use agents to learn from online video tutorials at inference time by retrieving, filtering, and converting videos into structured demonstration trajectories, then dynamically selecting relevant trajectories as in-context guidance during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents lag behind humans in tasks requiring domain-specific procedural knowledge about applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans bridge this gap by watching video tutorials, but current agents lack this capability.

Method: Proposes a framework that: 1) retrieves and filters tutorial videos, 2) converts them into structured demonstration trajectories using a VLM to infer UI actions and segment videos into short subsequences with textual objectives, 3) uses two-stage selection to dynamically choose the most relevant trajectory as in-context guidance at each execution step.

Result: Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants using only textual tutorials or transcripts. The approach demonstrates the importance of trajectory segmentation/selection, action filtering, and visual information.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time, bridging the gap between automated agents and human performance in complex computer tasks.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

*Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Raja Kolla,Ali Faraz,Shaharukh Khan,Akash,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, and presents a fast, lightweight rotation classification pipeline that achieves near-perfect accuracy and significantly boosts OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rotation correction is essential for enhancing OCR performance in real-world settings where misalignment commonly arises due to user errors during document capture.

Method: The authors introduce ORB benchmark with English and Indic language datasets, and develop a rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned for 4-class rotation classification.

Result: The method achieves 96% accuracy on ORB-En and 92% on ORB-Indic datasets, and boosts OCR performance by up to 14% for closed-source models and 4x for open-weights models.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation classification module is highly effective and plays a critical role in improving OCR performance in real-world document understanding scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different color transformation techniques affect image registration between H&E stained images and non-linear multimodal images in digital pathology, finding that CycleGAN color transformation achieves the lowest registration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration of images from different modalities is essential in digital pathology for applications like biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction, but registration between different stains or imaging modalities presents challenges.

Method: Used 20 tissue sample pairs with various preprocessing steps including different color transformation methods (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. Registered images using VALIS method with rigid then non-rigid registration, evaluated using relative Target Registration Error (rTRE).

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both scenarios (original and inverted multimodal images), while other methods showed higher errors.

Conclusion: Applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors from pre-trained vision encoders (DINOv2 and MedSAM) outperform handcrafted features in medical image classification, with SPDNet achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with DINOv2 features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariance descriptors have shown strong performance in general computer vision but remain underexplored in medical imaging. The paper investigates their effectiveness for medical image classification using both conventional and learning-based approaches.

Method: Proposed constructing covariance descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (GVEs) - DINOv2 and MedSAM. Compared them with handcrafted descriptors using SPDNet (a network for symmetric positive definite matrices) across eleven datasets from MedMNIST benchmark.

Result: Covariance descriptors from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted features. SPDNet combined with DINOv2 features yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for medical image analysis, demonstrating consistent improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AStF with higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis) for better motion style transfer, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional style transfer methods using only mean and variance are insufficient for motion data due to complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence.

Method: Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) with Style Disentanglement Module and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention, trained with Motion Consistency Regularization discriminator.

Result: Experimental results show proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating higher-order statistics provides more comprehensive modeling of spatiotemporal statistical patterns for improved motion style transfer.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts Sapiens, a human-centric foundation model for pose estimation, to medical imaging for anatomical landmark detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets with significant improvements over both generalist and specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, leveraging their inherent optimization for spatial pose localization as strong priors for medical applications.

Method: Adapted Sapiens (a human-centric foundation model) through multi-dataset pretraining to create MedSapiens for medical imaging landmark detection, benchmarking against existing state-of-the-art models in various data settings.

Result: MedSapiens achieved up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in average success detection rate (SDR), with 2.69% improvement in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection and can be effectively adapted to medical imaging, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating excellent adaptability to novel downstream tasks with limited annotations.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is an interpretable attribution framework that detects signal leaks in diffusion model outputs for AI image and deepfake forensics, achieving 98.13% Macro AUC without retraining for unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models has created a critical need for source attribution and authenticity verification, as diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces (signal leaks) in their outputs.

Method: The framework operates in the latent domain of diffusion models, re-simulating partial forward diffusion to expose generator-specific cues. It uses a temporal attention encoder to aggregate multi-step latent features and a feature-weighted prototype head to structure the embedding space for transparent attribution.

Result: Proto-LeakNet achieves a Macro AUC of 98.13%, learns a latent geometry that remains robust under post-processing, surpasses state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong separability between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics, demonstrating that the proposed framework effectively addresses the attribution challenge for synthetic media.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

TL;DR: DinoGRL framework uses DINOv2 to learn gait features for video-based visible-infrared person re-identification, combining silhouette representations with appearance cues through progressive multi-granularity enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VVI-ReID methods focus on modality-invariant visual features but overlook gait features, which are both modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model spatiotemporal consistency for cross-modal video matching.

Method: Proposed DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) with Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model and Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement (PBMGE) module that refines features through bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams.

Result: Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate superiority, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages gait features complementary to appearance cues, achieving robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval in VVI-ReID.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS is a novel acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that uses multi-view consistency-based densification and pruning to achieve 3.32× training acceleration while maintaining comparable rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS acceleration methods fail to properly regulate Gaussian numbers during training, causing redundant computational overhead and failing to balance training time with rendering quality.

Method: Proposes a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency without using budgeting mechanisms, focusing on Gaussian importance assessment.

Result: Achieves 3.32× training acceleration on Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and 15.45× acceleration on Deep Blending dataset compared to vanilla 3DGS, with comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FastGS demonstrates strong generality with 2-7× training acceleration across various tasks including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and SLAM.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration

TL;DR: Domain-specific vision foundation model for herbicide trials outperforms general-purpose models in species identification and damage classification, especially under unseen conditions, while reducing annotation requirements by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models have limited performance in agriculture where fine-grained species and damage type distinctions are critical for herbicide field trials.

Method: Adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large curated agricultural dataset to learn transferable representations optimized for herbicide trial images.

Result: Significant improvements in species identification (F1 from 0.91 to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33), with even greater gains under unseen conditions and domain shifts. Achieves 5.4% higher F1 score using 80% fewer labeled samples.

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models offer scalable automated solutions for herbicide trial analysis with strong generalization capabilities and significantly reduced annotation efforts.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses YOLOv10 models trained on synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to detect offshore infrastructure, achieving improved performance (F1 score from 0.85 to 0.90) and demonstrating geographic transferability across unseen regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of marine infrastructure requires effective monitoring systems, but current detection models struggle with scarce and unbalanced datasets, particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes.

Method: Training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models using a combination of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of Guinea, Coast of Brazil), then evaluating geographic transferability on three unseen regions (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf).

Result: The model detected 3,529 offshore platforms across three unseen regions (411 in North Sea, 1,519 in Gulf of Mexico, 1,593 in Persian Gulf) and achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which improved to 0.90 with synthetic data, demonstrating successful geographic transferability.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is an effective strategy to address dataset imbalance in remote sensing, enabling globally transferable detection of offshore infrastructure and highlighting the potential of deep learning for scalable global monitoring.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V integrates prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single step using a Rephrasing Adapter, enabling text-to-video models to generate higher quality videos from concise prompts by leveraging LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video diffusion models struggle with limited textual semantics understanding and cannot rephrase prompts online, leading to poor video quality with concise prompts and limiting model scalability and usability.

Method: Proposes RISE-T2V framework with a Rephrasing Adapter that uses text hidden states from LLM's next token prediction as video generation condition, implicitly rephrasing basic prompts into comprehensive representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show RISE-T2V significantly enhances video generation quality and user intent alignment across different video diffusion model architectures, enabling broader T2V task capabilities.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V is a versatile framework that improves text-to-video generation by integrating prompt rephrasing and semantic extraction, making models more effective at generating high-quality videos that match user intent from concise prompts.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements, making quantitative analysis more feasible in clinical settings.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

### [42] [Evaluating the Impact of Weather-Induced Sensor Occlusion on BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04347)
*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how sensor occlusions affect 3D object detection performance in BEVFusion architecture, showing that LiDAR is more critical than cameras for maintaining detection accuracy under occlusion conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of sensor occlusions (from fog, haze, or physical obstructions) on 3D object detection accuracy in automated vehicles, as this remains underexplored despite BEV-based fusion showing strong performance.

Method: Used BEVFusion architecture evaluated on nuScenes dataset, measuring detection performance using mAP and NDS metrics under various camera and LiDAR occlusion scenarios.

Result: Camera-only detection drops 41.3% in mAP under moderate occlusion, while LiDAR drops 47.3% only under heavy occlusion. In fusion, camera occlusion causes minor 4.1% drop but LiDAR occlusion causes 26.8% drop, showing stronger reliance on LiDAR.

Conclusion: The study reveals the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for 3D detection and highlights the need for occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques to handle partial sensor degradation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning can enhance spatial information extraction from imaging data in analytical chemistry, but adoption is limited due to lack of structured guidance for implementing existing models.

Method: Provides a step-by-step tutorial with MATLAB code demonstrations for using open-source deep learning models to extract deep features from various imaging modalities, focusing on feature extraction rather than model training.

Result: The tutorial enables analytical chemists to process imaging data from different modalities and integrate spatial features with other data sources like spectral information.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap in deep learning adoption for analytical chemistry by providing practical guidance for extracting spatial information from imaging data using existing models.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

system integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer
learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured
medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded

### [46] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg is a minimally supervised AI tool that combines SAM2 and YOLOv11 to automatically segment octopuses in videos, using unsupervised metrics for quality evaluation and enabling re-identification after occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing octopuses in natural habitats is difficult due to their camouflage, rapid skin changes, non-rigid deformations, occlusions, and challenging underwater conditions, compounded by the lack of large annotated datasets.

Method: Integrates SAM2 with custom-trained YOLOv11 object detector. Users provide initial point prompts for SAM2 to generate masks, which train YOLO. The pipeline then automates using bounding box prompts to SAM2. Introduces unsupervised metrics (temporal consistency DICE_t and new component count NC_t) for evaluation.

Result: Achieves satisfactory performance, reduces segmentation noise compared to manual prompting, and can re-identify octopuses after complete occlusions where manual methods fail.

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool that reduces manual analysis needs and enables more efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational solver for convex partition jigsaw puzzles, expanding beyond traditional square puzzles by using both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities with a greedy algorithm approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing jigsaw puzzle solvers only handle square puzzles, which severely limits their practical applications. The authors aim to expand computational puzzle solving to handle convex partitions - a major subset of polygonal puzzles with convex pieces.

Method: The authors utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities between puzzle pieces and introduce a greedy solver algorithm specifically designed for convex partition puzzles.

Result: The paper reports several performance measures and introduces the first benchmark dataset for convex partition puzzles, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.

Conclusion: This work significantly expands the types of jigsaw puzzles that can be solved computationally beyond traditional square puzzles, enabling practical applications in various domains through the handling of convex partition puzzles.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs lack deep integration of image interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities, constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.

Method: V-Thinker uses a Data Evolution Flywheel for automatic dataset synthesis and evolution, and a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum with two-stage reinforcement learning that first aligns perception then integrates interactive reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in general and interactive reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: V-Thinker provides valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications and represents a significant step toward enabling interactive, vision-centric thinking in multimodal models.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landslides cause severe damage, but conventional deep learning models struggle with cross-sensor applications, regional variations, and limited training data. There's a need for more robust approaches to landslide mapping for disaster preparedness and response.

Method: A three-axis analytical framework (sensor, label, and domain) for adapting geospatial foundation models, focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0. The approach uses global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning.

Result: Prithvi-EO-2.0 consistently outperformed task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). It proved resilient to spectral variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings.

Conclusion: GeoFMs represent a step toward more robust and scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring, though challenges remain in computational cost and limited availability of AI-ready training data for landslide research.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

*Nabyl Quignon,Baptiste Chopin,Yaohui Wang,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new comprehensive evaluation framework with 8 metrics across quality, naturalness, and synchronization dimensions for talking head video generation, addressing limitations in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation advances have outpaced development of adequate evaluation metrics, with limited metrics primarily assessing general video quality and lip synchronization, lacking comprehensive assessment.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework with 8 metrics focusing on three dimensions: quality, naturalness, and synchronization, emphasizing efficiency and human preference alignment. Analyzed fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, eyebrows, and face quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on 85,000 videos from 17 state-of-the-art models revealed that while algorithms excel in lip synchronization, they struggle with generating expressiveness and artifact-free details. Created a novel real dataset to mitigate training data bias.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark framework enables comprehensive evaluation of generative methods, with plans for public release of code, dataset, and leaderboards to track progress in the field.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STC-Net is a novel framework for automated surgical complexity estimation in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy using the Parkland Grading Scale, operating on full videos with weak temporal supervision through joint temporal localization and grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is crucial in LC as severe inflammation leads to longer operations and higher complication risks. Current methods lack automation for PGS grading in realistic scenarios where complete videos must be analyzed without manual curation.

Method: STC-Net performs single-timestamp-based complexity estimation via three modules: localization, window proposal, and grading. It uses a novel loss combining hard/soft localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision, operating directly on full videos without manual trimming.

Result: On 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieved 62.11% accuracy and 61.42% F1-score, outperforming non-localized baselines by over 10% in both metrics, demonstrating effective weak supervision for surgical complexity assessment.

Conclusion: STC-Net provides a scalable and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation from full LC videos, showing promise for post-operative analysis and surgical training applications.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Thinking with Video" paradigm using video generation models like Sora-2 to overcome limitations of text-only and image-only reasoning, achieving strong performance on vision and text tasks while enabling unified multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigms: (1) images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes, and (2) separation of text and vision hinders unified multimodal understanding and generation.

Method: Introduces "Thinking with Video" paradigm using video generation models (Sora-2) in a unified temporal framework, supported by VideoThinkBench benchmark with vision-centric and text-centric tasks. Uses self-consistency and in-context learning to improve performance.

Result: Sora-2 achieves comparable performance to SOTA VLMs on vision-centric tasks, surpassing them on tasks like Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, achieves 92% accuracy on MATH and 75.53% on MMMU. Self-consistency and in-context learning improve performance.

Conclusion: Video generation models like Sora-2 are potential unified multimodal understanding and generation models, positioning "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm that bridges visual and textual reasoning.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP enhances CLIP's fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating visual prompts and processing long textual descriptions using an LLM-based text encoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance through pixel-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP has limitations in fine-grained image-text alignment due to its text encoder's token length constraint, preventing it from processing detailed long-form textual descriptions that could improve alignment granularity.

Method: Proposed PixCLIP framework with: 1) Automated annotation pipeline generating pixel-level localized long-form descriptions, creating LongGRIT dataset (1.5M samples); 2) Replaced CLIP's text encoder with LLM; 3) Three-branch pixel-text alignment learning for arbitrary granularity alignment.

Result: PixCLIP achieves breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and long-form text handling, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained vision-language alignment tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PixCLIP framework successfully addresses CLIP's limitations by synergistically enhancing both visual and textual processing granularity, enabling superior fine-grained image-text alignment through pixel-level interactions and long-form text processing.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [55] [Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615)
*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework to evaluate virtual IHC stain quality from H&E images by measuring stain accuracy metrics rather than conventional image fidelity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for virtual IHC models focus on image fidelity but fail to assess the accuracy of IHC staining, which is critical for clinical applications.

Method: Using color deconvolution to generate masks of IHC-positive pixels from real and virtual IHC images, then computing stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) without needing manual annotations.

Result: Conventional metrics (FID, PSNR, SSIM) correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models achieve highest accuracy, while unpaired models are less reliable. WSI-level evaluation reveals performance declines not visible in patch-based analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible approach for assessing virtual IHC model quality, which is essential for accelerating clinical adoption by pathologists.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, streaming-based video quality assessment model that is both no-reference and opinion-unaware, using temporal-aware convolutional architecture trained on synthetic degradations to predict FR metrics without references at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA approaches have limitations: FR metrics need clean references, NR models require costly human labels, and most opinion-unaware methods are image-based and ignore temporal context critical for video.

Method: Leverages synthetic degradations of DAVIS dataset to train a temporal-aware convolutional architecture that predicts FR metrics (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video without references at inference.

Result: Outperforms image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations, achieves higher correlation with FR metrics compared to BRISQUE baseline, validating effectiveness of temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is valuable for scalable VQA in real-world vision systems, enabling effective no-reference, opinion-unaware video quality assessment that captures temporal context.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) uses polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging to improve eye tracking accuracy by revealing trackable features on the sclera and cornea that are invisible in intensity-only images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance eye tracking performance by leveraging polarization contrast mechanisms that provide additional optical information beyond traditional intensity-based imaging.

Method: Developed a PET system using a polarization-filter-array camera with linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator, and trained convolutional neural network models on data from 346 participants.

Result: PET reduced median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10-16% compared to intensity-only baselines, showing robustness against eyelid occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variations.

Conclusion: Polarization effects provide practical improvements for human-computer interaction and PET represents a simple, robust sensing modality suitable for future wearable devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

### [58] [Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655)
*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diagnostic framework to identify and mitigate non-visual biases in multimodal benchmarks, using Test-set Stress-Tests and Iterative Bias Pruning to create more robust evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks can be gamed without strong visual understanding by exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns, undermining their ability to properly evaluate visual capabilities.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) using fine-tuned LLMs on textual inputs to reveal shortcut performance, and 2) Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to filter high-bias samples from benchmarks.

Result: Applied to four benchmarks (VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME), revealing pervasive non-visual biases. Created VSI-Bench-Debiased with reduced non-visual solvability and wider vision-blind performance gap.

Conclusion: Benchmark designers should proactively game their own benchmarks using diagnostic procedures to identify and mitigate non-visual biases, ensuring more robust evaluation of multimodal models' true visual understanding.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIMS-V is a framework that uses 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models, enabling efficient training with minimal question types that transfer well to real-world spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space, and obtaining diverse real-world video data with precise spatial annotations is a bottleneck.

Method: Systematic data-generation framework leveraging 3D simulators' privileged information to create spatially-rich video training data, with systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales.

Result: Identified three key question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, temporal tracking) that enable effective transfer. A 7B-parameter model fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simulated data can effectively develop transferable spatial intelligence, enabling highly efficient training with robust generalization to real-world spatial tasks while maintaining general video understanding performance.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

*Shusheng Yang,Jihan Yang,Pinzhi Huang,Ellis Brown,Zihao Yang,Yue Yu,Shengbang Tong,Zihan Zheng,Yifan Xu,Muhan Wang,Daohan Lu,Rob Fergus,Yann LeCun,Li Fei-Fei,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'supersensing' as a new paradigm for multimodal AI, moving beyond reactive systems to include semantic perception, streaming event cognition, implicit 3D spatial cognition, and predictive world modeling. It introduces the VSI-SUPER benchmark and shows that scale alone is insufficient, advocating for predictive sensing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems are reactive and task-driven, lacking true spatial cognition and world modeling capabilities. Progress requires shifting from brute-force long context approaches to broader supersensing that includes anticipation and organization of experience.

Method: Proposed spatial supersensing framework with four stages. Created VSI-SUPER benchmark with VSR (visual spatial recall) and VSC (visual spatial counting) tasks resistant to brute-force context expansion. Trained Cambrian-S on VSI-590K dataset. Developed proof-of-concept predictive sensing using self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor that leverages prediction error for memory and event segmentation.

Result: Achieved +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without sacrificing general capabilities. Performance on VSI-SUPER remained limited despite data scaling, showing scale alone is insufficient. Predictive sensing approach substantially outperformed leading proprietary baselines on VSI-SUPER.

Conclusion: Spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate, select, and organize experience. Predictive sensing represents a promising path forward beyond current reactive systems and brute-force scaling approaches.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations (e.g., apple being cut, butterfly emerging), but existing tracking methods lose track after significant appearance changes. There's a need to track objects through transformations while understanding state changes.

Method: TubeletGraph system identifies overlooked tracks and integrates them based on semantic and proximity priors. It reasons about added tracks and generates state graphs describing each observed transformation.

Result: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under transformations and demonstrates deeper understanding of object transformations with promising capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: The work addresses the limitation of losing track after object transformations and provides a comprehensive solution for tracking objects through state changes while understanding transformation dynamics.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for multiple aesthetic crop generation by introducing a benchmark dataset and demonstrating the application of single-crop models with partitioning techniques, addressing a gap in existing research for social media applications.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem

efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as

TL;DR: Comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques (ERA, DMDc, LOpInf) for dynamic shape control of soft robots, showing LOpInf achieves best tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots need effective dynamic shape control, but lack general-purpose modeling tools for control due to high-dimensional dynamics.

Method: Compare three data-driven model reduction methods (ERA, DMDc, LOpInf) for generating linear models, tested in MPC policies for eel-inspired soft robot tracking three types of reference trajectories.

Result: LOpInf-based policies consistently generated lower tracking errors than other methods across all experiments with feasible, biological, and physical reference trajectories.

Conclusion: LOpInf method outperforms other data-driven model reduction techniques for dynamic shape control of soft robots, demonstrating its effectiveness for control-oriented modeling.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing soccer robot systems use decoupled modules causing delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, exacerbated by real-world perceptual limitations.

Method: Extends Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings, uses encoder-decoder architecture with virtual perception system to model real-world visual characteristics and recover privileged states from imperfect observations.

Result: Controller demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust soccer behaviors across various scenarios including real RoboCup matches.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control, establishing active coordination between perception and action for humanoid soccer robots.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for optimizing upper limb postures in bimanual human-robot co-carrying tasks, integrating physical ergonomics and force manipulability to enhance both safety and manipulative efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research typically focuses on either human safety or manipulative efficiency separately, but this work aims to integrate both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions like different grasping postures and object shapes.

Method: The method optimizes joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model by minimizing a cost function that prioritizes safety and manipulative capability. It uses a transformation module to generate reference end-effector poses for robots and proposes a bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) for trajectory recalibration on the CURI human-like robot.

Result: The method was validated through experiments with various subjects and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot collaboration (HRC). Results showed significant improvement in muscle conditions by comparing muscle activation before and after optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed upper limb postural optimization method effectively enhances physical ergonomics and force manipulability in bimanual co-carrying tasks, demonstrating practical benefits for human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-CRF system using Large Language Models to bridge the intention-to-action gap in human-UAV swarm collaboration for disaster search and rescue operations, reducing task completion time by 64.2% and improving success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the cognitive burden on human operators in coordinating UAV swarms for disaster SAR operations, specifically the error-prone 'intention-to-action gap' where high-level rescue objectives must be translated into low-level swarm commands under pressure.

Method: Developed LLM-CRF system that captures operator intention through natural multi-modal interactions (voice/graphical), uses LLM as cognitive engine for intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning, creating closed-loop proactive swarm partnership.

Result: In simulated SAR scenarios, reduced task completion time by 64.2%, improved task success rate by 7%, and reduced NASA-TLX cognitive workload scores by 42.9% compared to traditional command-based interfaces.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes disaster scenarios by bridging the intention-to-action gap and reducing cognitive burden.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates next-gen multi-core processors for planetary exploration GNC and LVS algorithms, achieving up to 15x speedup for LVS and 250x for GFOLD, while introducing ARBITER for fault tolerance through multi-core voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future planetary missions require high-performance, fault-tolerant computing for autonomous GNC and LVS operations during EDL phases, demanding improved computational capabilities over legacy hardware.

Method: Deployed GNC and LVS algorithms on HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx Versal processors, and developed ARBITER - a Multi-Core Voting mechanism for real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.

Result: Achieved up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x speedup for GFOLD trajectory optimization compared to legacy hardware. ARBITER successfully detected and corrected faults in both static optimization and dynamic control tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable, energy-efficient architecture for future missions requiring onboard autonomy, low latency, and fault resilience, with identified critical components needing selective protection.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

TL;DR: A biomimetic control framework using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) inspired by the human Central Nervous System achieves agile robotic arm control in complex environments, outperforming industrial-grade position control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic control algorithms struggle with agile manipulation in complex environments with dynamic trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects, especially as robotic arms extend into healthcare, service, and daily life applications.

Method: A biomimetic SNN framework with five CNS-inspired modules (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three hierarchical control levels, and two information pathways. Each module uses SNNs with specific implementations: spinal cord for feedback control, brainstem for parameter adjustment via RL, thalamus for cerebellum tuning, and cerebellum for dynamics learning.

Result: The framework was validated in simulation and on real-world robotic platforms under various loads and trajectories, demonstrating superior manipulation agility compared to industrial-grade position control.

Conclusion: The biomimetic SNN approach successfully addresses the limitations of traditional control algorithms for agile robotic manipulation in complex environments, providing a biologically-inspired solution that outperforms conventional industrial control methods.

Abstract: As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.

TL;DR: BFM-Zero is a behavioral foundation model framework for humanoid robots that learns a shared latent representation enabling a single policy to handle multiple tasks like motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization without retraining, with successful real-world deployment on Unitree G1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified behavioral foundation model for humanoid robots that can handle diverse control tasks under a single promptable policy, overcoming limitations of existing approaches that are either simulation-only or task-specific.

Method: Uses unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward models to learn a shared latent representation embedding motions, goals, and rewards. Extends with reward shaping, domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge sim-to-real gap.

Result: Enables versatile whole-body skills on real Unitree G1 humanoid via zero-shot motion tracking, goal reaching, reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation. Quantitative ablation studies validate design choices.

Conclusion: BFM-Zero represents a significant step toward scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid control, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and multi-task capability.

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Active SLAM methods suffer from slow exploration speed and suboptimal paths, limiting their efficiency in complex environments.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework with: 1) Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization DRL that jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through dual-objective reward function; 2) Lightweight Stagnation Detection using Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection to reduce redundant exploration.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves exploration efficiency in complex environments and demonstrates successful transferability from simulation to real-world robotic platforms.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world

TL;DR: GraspView is an RGB-only robotic grasping pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without depth sensors, outperforming RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB-D pipelines fail on transparent/glossy objects and degrade at close range, while cluttered environments with occlusion and poor perception quality lead to unstable grasps.

Method: Integrates three components: global perception scene reconstruction from single RGB view, render-and-score active perception for next-best-views, and online metric alignment for scale consistency with robot kinematics.

Result: Significantly outperforms RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects.

Conclusion: GraspView serves as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

*Marco Iannotta,Yuxuan Yang,Johannes A. Stork,Erik Schaffernicht,Todor Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Context-aware policies that estimate dynamics parameters during sim-to-real transfer outperform standard domain randomization approaches in robotics RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to dynamics discrepancies between simulation and reality. Standard domain randomization reduces performance, so the authors investigate whether conditioning policies on estimated dynamics parameters can improve transfer.

Method: Integrated a context estimation module into a domain randomization-based RL framework and systematically compared state-of-the-art supervision strategies for context-aware policies.

Result: Context-aware policies outperformed context-agnostic baselines across all settings in both a canonical control benchmark and real-world robot pushing task, though the best supervision strategy was task-dependent.

Conclusion: Conditioning policies on estimated dynamics parameters improves sim-to-real transfer performance over standard domain randomization approaches, with the optimal supervision strategy varying by task.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A tailsitter VTOL UAV with reconfigurable wings that retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed-wing mode, featuring a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor for power efficiency and a swashplateless mechanism with flapping hinges to reduce vibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tailsitter UAVs are lightweight but vulnerable to wind disturbances in multi-rotor mode due to large frontal fuselage area exposure.

Method: Designed a reconfigurable wing system, coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration for power efficiency, and an optimized swashplateless mechanism with flapping hinges to control pitch/roll and reduce vibration.

Result: The design achieves reduced power consumption, lower structural weight, simplified complexity, and minimized vibration during cyclic operations.

Conclusion: Comprehensive transition flight tests validated stable flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Conclusion: MacroNav effectively balances expressive spatial understanding with navigation efficiency, outperforming existing methods in real-world autonomous navigation tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraSP-VLA is a neuro-symbolic framework that uses Continuous Scene Graphs to generate symbolic representations from human demonstrations, enabling automatic planning domain generation and orchestrating low-level VLA policies for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models lack high-level symbolic planning for long-horizon tasks, while symbolic Action Model Learning (AML) approaches lack generalization and scalability.

Method: Uses Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate symbolic representations from human demonstrations, which then generates new planning domains and orchestrates low-level VLA policies.

Result: Effective for modeling symbolic representations in automatic planning domain generation from observations, and shows potential for orchestrating VLA policies in long-horizon tasks in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: GraSP-VLA successfully bridges the gap between neuro-symbolic approaches by combining the strengths of VLA models and symbolic planning, enabling scalable reproduction of actions in sequence for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

*Anna Mészáros,Javier Alonso-Mora,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper studies different approaches to representing agent interactions in autonomous driving scenarios, finding that explicit, well-defined interaction modeling outperforms implicit neural network learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how best to represent joint distributions of agents in scenes, particularly focusing on interactions between agents, as current approaches lack consensus on whether interactions should be learned implicitly by neural networks or explicitly modeled using spatial-temporal relations.

Method: The study compares various means of describing interactions within the same network structure, examining both implicit learning approaches (where networks establish connections based on data) and explicit modeling approaches (using well-defined interactions like which agent passes first at intersections).

Result: Findings show that allowing networks to implicitly establish interactive connections between agents based on data often has a detrimental effect on performance, while well-defined explicit interactions can bring clear performance improvements.

Conclusion: Explicit, well-defined interaction modeling (such as determining which agent passes first at intersections) is more effective than implicit neural network learning for capturing joint distributions of agents in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is
relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing
more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.
While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it
remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from
the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear
consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they
should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly
modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in
human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing
interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final
learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply
allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on
data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined
interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an
intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

TL;DR: ForeRobo is a generative robotic agent that uses generative simulations to autonomously learn manipulation skills through a propose-generate-learn-actuate cycle, achieving 56.32% improvement over state-of-the-art models and 79.28% success rate in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently leverage simulation for acquiring advanced manipulation skills, addressing the challenge of learning complex robotic manipulation while maintaining interpretability and execution efficiency.

Method: Integrates generative paradigms with classical control through a self-guided cycle: propose skills, generate simulation environments, create goal states (ForeGen), train state generation model (ForeFormer) to predict 3D goal positions, and use classical control for real-world execution.

Result: Achieved 56.32% average improvement over state-of-the-art state generation models across rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, with 79.28% success rate in real-world evaluations across 20+ tasks and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: ForeRobo demonstrates superior interpretability and execution efficiency compared to end-to-end policy learning, showing strong generalization across different manipulation patterns and successful real-world deployment.

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Temporal Action Selector (TAS) improves action chunking in Learning from Demonstration by caching predicted action chunks and dynamically selecting optimal actions, achieving better reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action chunking enhances modeling capabilities but reduces reactivity due to lower decision frequency, particularly affecting adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes. Existing methods trade off reactivity against decision consistency without achieving both.

Method: Proposed Temporal Action Selector (TAS) caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and uses a lightweight selector network to dynamically select optimal actions. Can be integrated with residual reinforcement learning.

Result: TAS significantly improves success rates with absolute gains up to 73.3% across multiple tasks. When used as base policy with residual RL, it enhances training efficiency and performance plateau. Validated in both simulation and physical robots.

Conclusion: TAS successfully addresses the reactivity limitation in action chunking while maintaining decision consistency and motion coherence, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse tasks and environments.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

Motivation: Current VLA models are computationally expensive, require massive robot data pretraining, degrade perceptual representations, and have poor deployability for real-time inference.

Method: Builds on native multimodal VLM, incorporates cross-modulated diffusion transformer with optimized integration module, and uses two-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception while preserving VLM representations.

Conclusion: Evo-1 demonstrates that lightweight VLA models can achieve strong performance without robot data pretraining, offering efficient deployment for real-time robotics applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

*Phat Nguyen,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Guy Rosman,Andrew Silva,Sertac Karaman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A shared autonomy framework that uses Vision Language Models to infer driver intent from multi-modal cues and mediate between human and autonomous control at a semantic level, reducing collisions and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems fail in rare, ambiguous scenarios where humans succeed through contextual reasoning, while existing shared autonomy methods only work at low-level trajectories without preserving driving intent.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models to infer driver intent from multi-modal cues (driver actions, environmental context) and synthesize strategies that mediate human and autonomous control at a higher semantic abstraction level.

Result: Achieved perfect recall with high accuracy/precision in mock-human tests, 92% participant agreement in human surveys, and substantial collision rate reduction with improved performance on Bench2Drive benchmark compared to pure autonomy.

Conclusion: Arbitration at semantic, language-based representations enables common-sense reasoning and maintains continuity with human intent, emerging as a key design principle for shared autonomy systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-to-sim framework that creates soft-body digital twins from real videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealistic rendering, enabling scalable and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies for deformable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world evaluation of robotic manipulation policies is costly and difficult to reproduce, especially for deformable objects, while existing simulators fail to capture the visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions.

Method: Constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Validated on deformable manipulation tasks (plush toy packing, rope routing, T-block pushing), showing strong correlation between simulated rollouts and real-world execution performance, revealing key behavioral patterns of learned policies.

Conclusion: Combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

### [83] [X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671)
*Maximus A. Pace,Prithwish Dan,Chuanruo Ning,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Audrey Du,Edward W. Duan,Wei-Chiu Ma,Kushal Kedia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: X-Diffusion is a framework that enables robots to learn from human videos by using diffusion processes to filter out embodiment-specific motion differences while preserving high-level task guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human videos are abundant and scalable training data for robots, but direct kinematic retargeting fails due to fundamental embodiment differences between humans and robots.

Method: X-Diffusion trains a classifier to distinguish human vs robot actions, then incorporates human actions only after adding sufficient noise where the classifier can't discern the embodiment. It uses robot-consistent actions for fine-grained denoising and human actions for coarse guidance at higher noise levels.

Result: X-Diffusion achieves 16% higher average success rate across five manipulation tasks compared to baselines, while naive co-training with execution mismatches degrades performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages human demonstrations by filtering out low-level execution differences through diffusion noise while preserving valuable high-level task guidance.

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website

*Qingzhou Lu,Yao Feng,Baiyu Shi,Michael Piseno,Zhenan Bao,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GentleHumanoid is a framework that integrates impedance control into whole-body motion tracking policies to achieve upper-body compliance in humanoid robots, enabling safer and more natural physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL policies for humanoid robots emphasize rigid tracking and suppress external forces, while existing impedance-augmented approaches are limited to base/end-effector control and focus on resisting forces rather than enabling compliance for safe human interaction.

Method: Uses a unified spring-based formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes/pulls from human motion data), ensuring kinematically consistent forces across shoulder, elbow, and wrist while exposing the policy to diverse interaction scenarios with task-adjustable force thresholds.

Result: Evaluated in simulation and on Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different compliance levels (gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, safe object manipulation). Consistently reduces peak contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more natural interactions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework represents a step toward humanoid robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in real-world environments through compliant physical interaction.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

TL;DR: DreamGym is a unified framework that synthesizes diverse experiences for scalable online RL training of autonomous agents, using reasoning-based environment models instead of costly real rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical RL adoption for LLM agents is challenging due to expensive rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity, which obstruct scalable experience data collection.

Method: DreamGym distills environment dynamics into reasoning-based experience models for consistent state transitions and feedback, uses experience replay buffers initialized with offline data, and adaptively generates new tasks for curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym substantially improves RL training across diverse environments, outperforming baselines by over 30% on non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, matches GRPO/PPO performance using only synthetic interactions, and provides significant performance gains with fewer real-world interactions in sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: DreamGym enables scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL by synthesizing diverse experiences, reducing reliance on costly real-environment interactions while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates NLP tokenization models for assembly code analysis, examining how tokenizer choices impact vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and downstream task performance like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis but remains underexplored, with significant impacts on vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and downstream task performance that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Conducted thorough study of various tokenization models with systematic analysis of encoding efficiency and semantic capture. Evaluated using state-of-the-art pre-trained models (Llama 3.2, BERT, BART) across multiple performance metrics with intrinsic evaluations of tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity.

Result: Tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. Complex trade-offs exist between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights for optimizing tokenization models in low-level code analysis, contributing to robustness and scalability of NLM-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether textual or image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) performance in reasoning over sequential user-behavior data.

Method: Developed BehaviorLens benchmarking framework that assesses modality trade-offs across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as text paragraphs, scatter plots, and flowcharts using a real-world purchase-sequence dataset.

Result: When data is represented as images, MLLMs achieve 87.5% improvement in next-purchase prediction accuracy compared to equivalent textual representations, with no additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: Image representations of user behavior data significantly outperform text representations for MLLM reasoning tasks, demonstrating the importance of modality selection in optimizing multimodal AI system performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or

*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DKT's effectiveness comes from modeling causal prerequisite relationships between knowledge components, not bidirectional relationships as previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing explanation that DKT's performance gains stem from bidirectional KC relationships and demonstrate its true strength lies in modeling causal prerequisite structures.

Method: Pruned exercise relation graphs into DAGs, trained DKT on causal subsets of Assistments dataset, and proposed alternative DAG extraction method using DKT's learned representations.

Result: DKT's predictive capabilities strongly align with causal structures, providing empirical evidence that it approximates causal dependencies between KCs.

Conclusion: DKT's effectiveness is driven by its capacity to model causal prerequisite relationships rather than simple bidirectional relational mappings.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show cultural bias despite prompt variations - they respond to language and cultural framing but remain anchored to values from a few dominant countries (Netherlands, Germany, US, Japan), failing to adequately represent global cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether LLMs can represent cultural diversity given their broad global usage and documented training data imbalances, by testing how prompt language and cultural framing influence model responses across different countries.

Method: Probed 10 LLMs with 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural perspectives.

Result: Both prompt language and cultural perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but models show systematic bias toward values from Netherlands, Germany, US, and Japan. Models produce neutral responses with selective progressive stances, and cultural framing improves alignment more than targeted language.

Conclusion: LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle ground - responsive enough to produce variation but too anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent cultural diversity, with cultural framing being more effective than language targeting for improving alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

TL;DR: ArchPilot is a multi-agent system that addresses computational inefficiency in automated ML engineering by using proxy-based evaluation and adaptive search to reduce reliance on expensive full training runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents for automated ML engineering suffer from high computational costs due to repeated full training runs, limiting scalability and iteration speed in large search spaces.

Method: Uses three specialized agents: orchestration agent with MCTS-inspired algorithm and restart mechanism, generation agent for architecture creation and improvement, and evaluation agent for proxy training and fidelity-aware scoring.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines like AIDE and ML-Master on MLE-Bench, demonstrating effective ML engineering under limited budgets.

Conclusion: ArchPilot's multi-agent framework with proxy-based evaluation enables efficient ML architecture search by prioritizing high-potential candidates while minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

Result: Supervised (XGBoost) achieved 98% accuracy and semi-supervised (SVDD) achieved 96% accuracy on the curated datasets, demonstrating comparable performance between the two approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks, and insights to guide future research in detecting silent failures in agentic trajectories.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but amplify them, and irrelevant context causes systematic shifts in magnitude representations, revealing vulnerabilities in multi-attribute decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and integrate multiple numerical attributes of entities, and how irrelevant numerical context affects these representations and outputs.

Method: Combined linear probing with partial correlation analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but systematically amplify them; irrelevant context induces consistent shifts in magnitude representations with downstream effects varying by model size.

Conclusion: Reveals vulnerabilities in LLM decision-making and provides groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering is a framework that treats redistricting as a turn-based negotiation between opposing political agents using LLMs, significantly reducing partisan bias and variance compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing redistricting methods generate legally valid maps but ignore strategic selection processes, allowing partisan actors to cherry-pick politically advantageous maps despite technical compliance.

Method: Uses a Choose-and-Freeze protocol where two LLM agents representing opposing interests alternate selecting and freezing districts from candidate maps, gradually partitioning states through constrained strategic choices.

Result: Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data shows significant reduction in partisan bias and unfairness, with 2-3 orders of magnitude lower variance than baselines, especially effective in swing states.

Conclusion: Agentmandering successfully embeds strategic interaction into redistricting, demonstrating both fairness and stability improvements over traditional computational approaches.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

### [95] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR is a collaborative framework where LLMs work with a structured KG retriever to handle knowledge-intensive questions, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen knowledge graphs through efficient propagation and iterative reasoning interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge, while existing methods are limited by dataset-specific tuning and poor scalability on large or unseen graphs.

Method: Proposes LLM-KGFR framework with Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever that encodes relations using LLM descriptions, initializes entities based on question roles, and uses Asymmetric Progressive Propagation for efficient large graph handling through stepwise expansion with selective node limitation.

Result: The framework achieves strong performance while maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for KG-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR offers an effective collaborative approach for knowledge graph reasoning that addresses scalability and generalization limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing quality through human-centered benchmarking, addressing both simulation quality (realistic test conversations) and evaluation quality (accurate response assessment).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice AI agents are scaling to billions of daily interactions but lack systematic methods for testing reliability, creating a critical measurement gap that prevents organizations from objectively assessing testing approaches.

Method: Combines psychometric techniques (pairwise comparisons with Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to provide reproducible metrics for any testing approach.

Result: Empirical evaluation of three commercial platforms using 21,600 human judgments revealed statistically significant performance differences: top platform Evalion achieved 0.92 evaluation quality (f1-score) vs 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality vs 0.43 for others.

Conclusion: The framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [97] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empowerment-based AI assistance designed for single humans can cause disempowerment (reduced influence and rewards) for other humans in multi-human environments, revealing alignment challenges in multi-agent contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how empowerment-based assistance, which works well in single-human settings, behaves in multi-human environments where it may negatively impact other humans.

Method: Created Disempower-Grid test suite and used assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment, then characterized when disempowerment occurs and tested joint empowerment as mitigation.

Result: Empowerment-optimizing agents for one human significantly reduced another human's environmental influence and rewards (disempowerment), and joint empowerment mitigated this but at the cost of user rewards.

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives like empowerment that appear aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent contexts, presenting a broader challenge for AI alignment.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a mathematical model that quantifies workflow quality and efficiency by combining probabilistic performance estimation with structural quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison, scoring, and optimization of workflows by integrating correctness, reliability, and cost into a coherent evaluation framework.

Method: Combines Opus Workflow Reward (probabilistic function for success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain) with Opus Workflow Normative Penalties (measurable functions for structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene).

Result: A unified framework that supports automated workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization, and can be integrated into Reinforcement Learning loops for workflow discovery and refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for evaluating and optimizing workflows through joint reward-penalty trade-offs, enabling systematic workflow improvement in automation systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent predictive coding framework that enables agents to develop efficient communication and social representations through information bottleneck optimization, achieving graceful performance degradation under bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sharing consistent spatial memory in multi-agent systems where partial observability and limited bandwidth cause coordination failures.

Method: Multi-agent predictive coding with information bottleneck objective, self-supervised motion prediction for grid-cell-like spatial coding, hierarchical reinforcement learning for active exploration, and emergent social place cells.

Result: Achieves 73.5% to 64.4% success rate on Memory-Maze benchmark as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, significantly outperforming full-broadcast baseline (67.6% to 28.6%).

Conclusion: Establishes a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for emergent social collective intelligence through unified predictive drive.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop is a self-improving framework that addresses RL overfitting in verifiable reward training by using iterative policy initialization to preserve policy diversity and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL training for verifiable rewards suffers from overfitting where models gain training rewards but lose generalization, driven by policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions.

Method: RLoop uses iterative policy initialization: RL explores solution space, successful trajectories are filtered to create expert dataset, then Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning refines the initial policy for next iteration.

Result: RLoop mitigates forgetting and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Conclusion: Iterative policy initialization effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains, creating a virtuous cycle of exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-360° is a large-scale dataset and benchmark for computer-using agents (CUAs) that addresses gaps in real-world tasks, automated multi-modal trajectory collection, and unified evaluation of GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three persistent gaps in CUA research: scarcity of real-world tasks, lack of automated multi-modal trajectory pipelines, and absence of unified benchmarks for GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.

Method: Uses an LLM-augmented automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. Contains 1.2M+ action steps across Windows office applications with screenshots, metadata, goals, reasoning traces, and both successful/failed trajectories.

Result: Benchmarking shows state-of-the-art vision-language models have substantial shortcomings in grounding and action prediction. Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning provide significant improvements but don't reach human-level reliability.

Conclusion: GUI-360° facilitates reproducible research and accelerates progress on robust desktop computer-using agents by providing a comprehensive dataset and benchmark suite.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Probe accuracy alone is unreliable for assessing concept alignment in CAVs, as probes often capture spurious correlations. A new spatial linear attribution method is introduced with metrics showing that translation-invariant and spatially-aligned probes improve concept alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of probe accuracy as a measure of concept alignment in Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), since probes frequently capture unintended spurious correlations rather than the intended concepts.

Method: Introduces a novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, compares it to existing feature visualization techniques, and proposes three metrics for quantitative assessment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

Result: Demonstrates that deliberately misaligned probes exploiting spurious correlations achieve accuracy close to standard probes. Shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment consistently increase concept alignment.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for alignment-based evaluation metrics over probe accuracy, and emphasizes tailoring probes to both model architecture and target concept nature to improve concept alignment.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RxSafeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs through simulated clinical consultations, revealing that current LLMs struggle with integrating contraindication and interaction knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on medication safety of LLMs in healthcare due to lack of real-world datasets and evaluation in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication safety.

Method: Developed a framework that simulates clinical consultations, generated inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks, created RxRisk DB with 6,725 contraindications and 28,781 drug interactions, and used a two-stage filtering strategy to create RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality scenarios.

Result: Current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit, highlighting challenges in ensuring medication safety.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support through better prompting and task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework that extends existing Generate-Verify paradigms by adding explicit monitoring processes based on metacognitive theories, aiming to prevent the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time reasoning architectures exclude monitoring processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin, leading to the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal paths and suffer ~20% accuracy loss.

Method: Formalize Flavell's and Nelson and Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the MGV framework that adds explicit monitoring before generation begins and refines monitoring through verification feedback.

Result: No empirical validation presented, but provides the first systematic computational translation of foundational metacognitive theories.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggests specific architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT) is a post-training method that improves LLMs' decision-making by repeatedly fine-tuning on low-regret trajectories, enabling better exploration-exploitation tradeoffs without rigid output engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making tasks despite being deployed as agents, failing to achieve low regret or effective exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in interactive environments.

Method: Iterative RMFT repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base model by rolling out multiple trajectories, selecting the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tuning the model on them using regret as the training signal.

Result: The method improves decision-making performance across diverse models (Transformers, open-weight LLMs, GPT-4o mini) and generalizes across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT provides a principled and general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities, with theoretical support showing Transformers can act as no-regret learners under this paradigm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [107] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO improves upon GRPO by using an adaptive baseline that prevents positive reinforcement of failed trajectories and transitions to relative preference mode once quality thresholds are met, enabling better learning from ordinal rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's simplicity becomes problematic when using ordinal rewards for partial credit, as its group-average baseline can positively reinforce failed trajectories and incorrect behavior.

Method: CoRPO introduces an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold to prevent positive reinforcement of failed solutions, then transitions to relative preference mode for optimization once quality standards are consistently met.

Result: Empirical validation on code verification tasks shows CoRPO achieves more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: CoRPO represents a critical advancement in enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback, progressing from binary to ordinal rewards as part of a broader research program for teaching LLMs genuinely new capabilities.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

*Carnot Braun,Rafael O. Jarczewski,Gabriel U. Talasso,Leandro A. Villas,Allan M. de Souza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVe combines classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning to create personalized vehicle routing that understands complex human contexts like multi-step tasks and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing systems only optimize singular metrics like time or distance and cannot interpret complex human contexts such as multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach with an LLM agent that evaluates candidate routes from a multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm against user tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules, leveraging a geospatial cache of urban POIs.

Result: Achieved over 88% accuracy in initial route selections with a local model, successfully incorporating complex user intent into appropriate route modifications in realistic urban scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning is a robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable urban mobility solutions.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

### [109] [Promoting Sustainable Web Agents: Benchmarking and Estimating Energy Consumption through Empirical and Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04481)
*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the sustainability issues of web agents, analyzing their energy consumption and CO2 emissions through theoretical estimation and empirical benchmarking, revealing that more energy doesn't necessarily mean better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents are advancing rapidly but their sustainability impact remains largely unexplored, creating an urgent need to understand and address the energy and environmental costs of these AI systems.

Method: The researchers used both theoretical estimation and empirical benchmarking approaches to analyze energy consumption and CO2 emissions of web agents, comparing different design philosophies.

Result: Findings show that different web agent design philosophies significantly impact energy consumption, and higher energy use doesn't always correlate with better performance. The study also identified lack of transparency in model parameters as a barrier to accurate energy estimation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for changing how web agents are evaluated by incorporating dedicated energy consumption metrics in benchmarks, highlighting the need for sustainability considerations in web agent development.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

*Andrea Cera Palatsi,Samuel Martin-Gutierrez,Ana S. Cardenal,Max Pellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can replicate human decision-making patterns in game-theoretic experiments, with Llama closely matching human cooperation patterns while Qwen aligns with Nash equilibrium predictions, enabling systematic exploration of novel experimental spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making, as misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications and failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations.

Method: Developed a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introduced a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation, testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen).

Result: Llama reproduced human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligned closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Population-level behavioral replication was achieved without persona-based prompting.

Conclusion: Appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional social science research that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [111] [Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04556)
*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven sparse sensing framework integrated with EPA-SWMM optimizes sensor placement and reconstructs peak flowrates in stormwater systems, achieving high accuracy with minimal sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban surface water flooding is increasingly frequent, but practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder high-resolution flood prediction and monitoring. The challenge is to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained resources.

Method: Integrated EPA-SWMM with data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, using singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for sensor allocation. Applied to Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota.

Result: Three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.92-0.95. The framework showed good robustness to measurement uncertainty and location-dependent robustness to sensor failures.

Conclusion: The DSS framework balances computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy flow reconstruction with minimal sensors, and can be integrated with predictive models for flood early warning under limited sensing resources.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

*Atsuyuki Miyai,Mashiro Toyooka,Takashi Otonari,Zaiying Zhao,Kiyoharu Aizawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jr. AI Scientist is an autonomous AI system that mimics a novice researcher's workflow to analyze papers, formulate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write papers, demonstrating better performance than fully automated systems but with identified limitations and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand AI Scientist systems' capabilities and risks for ensuring trustworthy AI-driven scientific progress while preserving academic integrity.

Method: Developed Jr. AI Scientist system that follows a research workflow: analyzes baseline paper limitations, formulates novel hypotheses, validates through experimentation, and writes papers using modern coding agents for complex implementations.

Result: Jr. AI Scientist generates papers with higher review scores than existing fully automated systems, but limitations were identified through author evaluations and Agents4Science reviews.

Conclusion: Current AI Scientist systems have important limitations and risks that need addressing before direct application, highlighting key challenges for future research in AI-driven scientific development.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [113] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes ambiguity in natural language queries as cooperative interaction rather than a deficiency, developing a framework to distinguish resolvable cooperative queries from uncooperative ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle query ambiguities, but current evaluations mix query types inadequately for assessing both execution accuracy and interpretation capabilities.

Method: Developed a principled framework to distinguish cooperative vs uncooperative queries, then applied it to analyze queries in 15 popular tabular QA and analysis datasets.

Result: Found uncontrolled mixing of query types in existing datasets that is inadequate for proper system evaluation, both for execution accuracy and interpretation capabilities.

Conclusion: Shifts perspective from fixing ambiguity to embracing cooperation in query resolution, enabling more informed design and evaluation of natural language interfaces for tabular data.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [114] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)
*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auditing framework using justified representation to measure how well a small set of questions represents participants' interests in deliberative processes, with efficient algorithms and applications to real-world deliberations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting a limited number of questions that best represent all participants' interests in deliberative processes like citizens' assemblies, where time constraints prevent asking all proposed questions.

Method: Developed an auditing framework based on justified representation (JR) from social choice theory, with efficient algorithms (O(mn log n) runtime) for auditing JR in general utility settings. Applied methods to historical deliberations comparing moderator-chosen questions, ILP-selected questions, and LLM-generated summaries.

Result: Applied auditing methods to real deliberations, revealing both promise and limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. Integrated methods into an online deliberation platform used in 50+ countries.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to audit and improve representation in deliberative processes, with practical implementation in a widely-used online platform, though LLMs show current limitations in fully supporting deliberation.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [115] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR. WELL is a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses symbolic planning and a two-phase negotiation protocol to enable robust coordination without requiring detailed trajectory synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative multi-agent planning faces challenges with partial information, limited communication, and brittle trajectory-level coordination where small timing deviations cause conflicts.

Method: Two-phase negotiation protocol: agents propose candidate roles with reasoning, then commit to joint allocation under consensus. After commitment, agents independently generate symbolic plans for their roles without revealing detailed trajectories, using a shared dynamic world model.

Result: Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show improved task completion rates and efficiency, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and enabling evolving collaboration strategies.

Conclusion: Symbolic planning enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable, avoiding brittle step-level alignment while trading time overhead for more efficient collaboration strategies.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT is a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from Chain-of-Thought reasoning using first-order logic and automated solvers, enabling identification of flawed reasoning and improving reasoning validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs using Chain-of-Thought reasoning cannot reliably verify their own logic, even when reaching correct answers, which undermines trust in high-stakes scenarios where flawed reasoning may exist.

Method: Formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order logic, identifies premises that ground arguments in source context/commonsense/prior steps, uses automated solvers for logical verification, and leverages verification for self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning, and preference fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness. Verification-based fine-tuning further improves reasoning validity and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriCoT provides a systematic approach to verify LLM reasoning, enabling both automated and human verification of logical validity, and can be leveraged to improve reasoning quality through various fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
